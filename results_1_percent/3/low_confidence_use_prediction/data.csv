wonder if the u.s. navy is a victim of emp/hack attacks rather than command incompetence.  it wouldn't be difficult to attack relatively vulnerable tanker navigational systems with emp/hacks. emp/hack attacks on u.s. naval ships might be more difficult, but a narrow directed emp/hack is still a possibility.

Collectively the monies spent on social services in BC is massive but the quality of services continues to decline. Where does all of the money go? The PHS was a case in point. If every available tax dollar went to health and education, it still wouldn't be enough. Why, because there is zero accountability. The further one moves down the income scale, the higher the sense of entitlement it seems. 
Leftist politicians play on this emotion, promising everything to everyone. Sure, tax the wealthy is a clarion call on the left, but what happens if they all decide to stay home too, who will pay.

Every year, I disagreed and bet against them by purchasing 3 homes in Vancouver area.  Needless to say, I've done well.  Here is why the so-called experts have been wrong and why a bubble burst is unlikely at least for the next 4 more years.

1.  Why the experts have been wrong:  Experts tried to give several reasons for the impending doom (high debt to income ratio, the previous 2008 crash in the US as an example, etc) whilst ignoring the most basic concept of economics.  There is a pitiful lack of housing supply with respect to surging population growth in YVR and increasing foreign investors.  The city is acting (reacting i should say) now to build but it is late.  Supply will catch up eventually but not for at least 10 years.

Briefly - ""Contrary to a message of salvation through Christ alone (Acts 4:12), the Gnostic Jesus brings a message of self-redemption.

Christianity and Gnosticism are mutually exclusive; however, it is easy for a Gnostic mindset to seep into our own thinking if we’re not careful (1 Peter 5:8).
