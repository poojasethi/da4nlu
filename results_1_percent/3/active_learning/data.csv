Shifting blame to Democrats and even Republicans instead of Trump himself.

Sorry you lost me right there. Trump is a grown ass man and can take responsibility for what he does.

According to bruddah Carl's train of thought up there in Kam Heights, the old fire departments, like the early militia, must have been crack troops, boot camp institutionalized, and professionals possessing ""military grade"" equivalent equipment; not town-folk pedestrians.  (Whatever bruddah means by ""military grade"" applicable to ""guns"" at the time.  To distinguish, guns are the pistols, whereas muskets are the rifles.  I think the thought here is assault rifles rather than ""guns,""......eh, bruddah Carl?)  Never mind it had been feared that a central govt posed a threat to the freedom of not just the virgin states, but further, to the nation's citizenry.  Yet here, Carl would have deprived the farmers of their muskets, since muskets were the state of the art ""military grade guns"" of the time.

3249,"Another way to look it at:  

Trump was very plain about his stance on illegal immigration.

There was huge public support for this stance.  So huge, it got him elected.  This means that it's the mandate of the republic, and current opinion polls show the majority of the citizens support it.

The laws against illegal immigration long preceded Trump.

The laws against illegal immigrants were enforced by Obama and other presidents.

And no one invited them, and they are breaking the law.
