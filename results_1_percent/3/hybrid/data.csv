Will the proposed prayer reduce the percentage of each Mass when the people practice patience instead of participation?  Will it in any way build up the sense of community?  Does it help people make decisions in their buying, working, voting?  

We are  much more in need of eliminating the interruptions to the basics of the Mass: Well prepared proclamations of the Word.  Discussions of the applications of Scripture to daily life instead of to theological concepts.  Mutual support for carrying out Christianity instead of Western culture.  Then is the fellowship with a clear, uninterrupted line of take, thank, share among the community without a lot of theological commentary or historic insertions.

3382,"What I found out when I started to attend a protestant bible study in college was that I knew a lot more of the ""integrative message"" of Scripture than most of my bible memorizing protestant friends.

I may not have been able to impress myself or others with verse/verbatim.

But I was less prone to confusion when one protestant friend tried to one up another protestant friend with a proof text.

Instead I fell back on my faith and on my constant exposure to Scripture through the Holy Mass, and was able to offer a more integrative scriptural answer to one of the points of the Bible study, even though I couldn't quote chapter/verse.

Instead I would say, as an example...""doesn't it also say somewhere in the NT that we should love God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength""?

William, what I believe to be wrong is when people change the truth, not only as recorded in the Bible, but the Truth which is in Christ, in the Spirit. If you continue to deny the doctrine within the Bible and yet claim you are led by the Spirit, should people just accept what you say as the truth?

The elimination of this provision in the WTO would be the end of the system, of which the biggest beneficiary is the United States. But will Britain out of the EU want to sign an FTA with th US that does not have a dispute settlement mechanism similar to Article 19 of NAFTA? Will the EU complete its FTA with the US without such a mechanism? In the Canada/US FTA Canada sought complete exemption from US protectionism.

There is no definitive ""correct"" deity to worship. Satan is as much a ""god"" as ""God"". As are the numerous pantheons of synonymous gods who PRE-DATE the single god ideology. 
The first context of worshiping a single god had nothing to do with ""Christ"", ""Jehova"", ""Jesus"" or any other ""Holy Trinity"" representation.

The aspects represented by Jehovah, Lucifer, and Jesus (in Hinduism: Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu) as separate entities were actually a single entity in multiple manifestations. 

In the end, all of the traits that we consider ""god like"", are simply aspects of man, which we choose to glorify and provide praise for.

3122,"Sir, that argument is ridiculous. Did the prohibition of slavery entail deciding on sodomy, gay marriage, birth control, the death penalty, etc? If we still had slavery and the Catholic Church was leading the way to abolish slavery, would that mean ""Catholic mob"" at the state level?

Once again, I love liberals and their logic.  They want ""Catholic mob"" when it comes to immigration reform, free health care, welfare programs, social services, etc. Then they have no problem using the influence of the Catholic Church and even citing popes like Pope Francis to bolster their claims.

When it comes to moral issues, all of a sudden the Church needs to butt out because we have a ""separation of church and state"" in America and we mustn't impose our religious views on an unwilling nation. 

When you get on the bishops for trying to legislate and impose Catholic social teaching on the nation, you have room to talk about ""Catholic mob"" on moral issues.",0,-0.0034061636029703024,0.0034061636029703024
