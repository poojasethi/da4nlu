I may not have been able to impress myself or others with verse/verbatim.

But I was less prone to confusion when one protestant friend tried to one up another protestant friend with a proof text.

Instead I fell back on my faith and on my constant exposure to Scripture through the Holy Mass, and was able to offer a more integrative scriptural answer to one of the points of the Bible study, even though I couldn't quote chapter/verse.

Instead I would say, as an example...""doesn't it also say somewhere in the NT that we should love God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength""?

and contributing to the life of their local church.

Increasingly in the minds of many Adventists, school and its activities are essential and the church is optional - if nothing else is going on.

One can argue the merits of that and miss the pragmatic point.  Actually three points.

1. Increasingly, we are training a whole generation of children and their parents that church and active, involved, contribution, as stated above are optional and not essential.  Again, whichever side of the issue you might take - it is important to make the decision intentionally instead of drifting into it.  Maybe church should no longer be the important element in the lives of Adventist christians - but if we allow the trend to continue we will suffer a catastrophic result.

2.  Most non-Adventist Christian schools - including some very large and successful ones,  operate without subsidy froma local church.  They survive, and often thrive on the basis of tuition.  In our educational culture,",0,-3.431988760598989,3.431988760598989

He taught that we all had access to agape' love, not just the few who could recite the rules.     

Faith is not passive, it's an active search by each of us.  Jesus turned the hierarchy and expectation of the Jewish faith upside down.     You might find it fun to take your faith with serious intention and share with others who believe in the guidance of the Spirit and living revelation.

This unrectified theft accounts for roughly 1/4 to 1/3 of many (most) Tier 1 members benefits.

I spent a relatively brief period on the UO faculty back in the early 1980s and thus am a Tier 1 PERS member. But when learned about the impacts on schools, police and other public services because of the theft, as well as grossly irresponsible provisions (such as the ""money match""), I vigorously tried to get fellow Tier 1 employees to support at least adjusting benefits to rectify the stolen funds. I also tried to get the Eugene City Council to do what it could to address the issue, but the response was a collective shrug.
 
In response, many of those I'd considered friends turned on me like hyenas because I dared to question the legitimacy of their ""lottery winnings.""

Scripture is replete with teachings about what life was like 4000 to 2000 years ago, and pretty much limited to the area we now call the Middle East.  Anyone who thinks our theology, or the sciences, or the Christian Church should adhere to all of that ancient thought is really pretty stunted themselves.  Once again, we are a Church Unfinished, and our theological understandings of humankind on that salvific road to our final meeting with Christ must come along for the trip.  If left solely up to Scripture, a whole lot of Catholic practice and protocols would be roundly condemned by biblical purists (and it has been).

Sadly, in the process of differentiation they became too distinct and, to my understanding the self-interests of a fossilizing institutionalism of Church could not accommodate the advances.  Once ""delinked"" natural law lost its foundation in reality and was coopted as a ""hammer"" for theology. It became top down rather than a dialogue with physics, chemistry, biology, anthropology, etc.  It became a justification for theology, dogma and doctrine, worse, it became a weapon of control.
Not only is the radical diversity of nature excluded but they seem to have also excluded the ""observer"" thereof: human intelligence that guides the custodian of creation, us.
One more point, what we call ""natural law"" is NOT law.  It is ""norm"" and norm presupposes ""outside the norm"". The Church has elevated norm to absolute, to law and doctrine,  selectively labeling ""outside the norm"" as outside the ""law"", sin, intrinsically evil.

The KJV translation of Titus 1:5 has a curious history.  A literal translation form the Greek would be ""establish elders (presbyters)"".

Based only on his public image and statements, I think there are two crucial observations. 

First, he is adamant to actualize the eccesiology of V2, which P6, JP2 and P16 have systematically ignored, preferring V1. Second, he is utterly focused on a Christianity of service of others. The latter is, I think, both an expression of his own enormous heart and a conscious decision to point forward in a direction the neither side can gainsay. And this is the characteristic that seems to make him adorable to just about anyone of good will.

But in the longer term, IMHO, it is the first propensity that is most important.

The third class are only regulated in terms of their academic curriculum being directed towards the same matric examinations, but otherwise they are free to set their own rules, particularly in religious matters.

1737,"At the Cub Scout age (8-10), the major difficulty with the boys was they were in their early years of becoming aware of girls. Often they might show affection (os sorts) with a playful punch on the shoulder or something like that. Girls are more mature at that age and don't really like that kind of stuff. When the boys reach 10 they are a bit more circumspect and may misbehave trying to attract the attention of the girl in silly ways. In my experience this is when the girls might start dropping out and few would make it to Scouts (11-14). Now Venturers (15-17) and Rovers (18-26) were a different matter!",0,-2.614787457926501,2.614787457926501
1421,"First of all the term ""Ecclesial Communities"" was first used in Unitatis Redintegratio a document of the Second Vatican Council. As far as I am aware this caused no offence at the time. Dominus Jesus just repeated what the Council said.
If there is going to be Church unity then Protestant churches will have to accept the Catholic doctrine of the Mass and the Sacraments particularly regarding Holy Orders. At present Protestant churches deny that the Mass is a Sacrifice and do not ordain their ministers to be sacrificing priests (sacerdotes). UR and DI simply and honestly remind these churches of their position vis-à-vis the Catholic Church.
If the Catholic Church is the one true Church which I believe it is, then it can make no concessions without renouncing this claim.",0,-2.6115392279257126,2.6115392279257126
927,"That's not true. If it were true, woman would therefore not be human. Or, if you are talking about certain countries - certainly not most of the Western World - I could understand your point. But that is based on developing countries wherefore a woman's freedom is less than the fruitful bountiful life in comfort and prosperity. Which agreed. Yet, since were talking about places like the U.S. and vast majority of the Western Developed World, that isn't the case wherefore many women (the vast majority) have those freedoms and comforts, which they choose to sleep with men for the casual convenience and pleasure of sex with them. I've witnessed in my small population pool and sample in my own family.

Today's New York Times has an article about the marked increase of extreme rain events in the broader scheme of things. From the article: ""About 40 years ago, the earth’s surface temperatures began to break out of their recent historical range and just kept climbing. Not coincidentally, the number of storms with extreme rainfall began to increase around the same time."" They provide graphs. I suggest you check it out.
