What we found back then was that the fittest kids have oxygen uptakes ( MVO 2) in the high 70's and one was an 81. For perspective for adults, this put some kids in the range of world class middle distance runners or elite cyclists. Since the majority of kids were pre adolescent, this is quite normal. We noticed that once the kids hit high school their oxygen uptakes dramatically decreased. 
So what I'm saying is that if we influence children with regular exercise when their young, then their natural drop off will be less when they hit puberty. 
Picard is right. Kids are meant to move constantly. A 15 minute run/ brisk walk is a start. Not a solution. Everything fitness related starts at home very early. Parents can be a solution .

Other encyclicals that further develop these concepts of the duties of the state toward the people, especially the poor are:

1.  Quadragesimo anno [Pope Pius XI, 1931]

 Astruc's methods were then used, when German scholors picked up the study. With considerable funding by the German Chancellor Bismark, for his own ends. 

As far a Jerome goes, he had access to the Library of Caesarean (over 30,000 manuscripts), where Eusebius mentions seeing the Hebrew (Aramaic?) gospel of Matthew.

The issue isn't that nothing has changed, as you suggest, but it is that the rules of yore no longer apply.  The positive regard for diversity and equality that has taken hold among the younger generations as well as Vatican II Catholics, is clearly seen in all aspects of our culture.  The Ecumenism of Vatican II is to thank in large part for the shift that had the Church and secular moving in the same direction on a few key issues.  I think the Holy Spirit has already called the Christian bishops and many of us born after the Council joined those who started the march as we learned of it.

1963,"I can accept that the adjectival phrase 'one in being' does not perfectly express the relationship between the Father and Jesus; it does, however, communicate that they are, in a manner that non-scriptural, philosophical language has attempted to illuminate, one. 

The adjective 'consubstantial', for its part, could also lead a praying individual to a heterodox conclusion about the relationship between the Father and Jesus.

The idea expressed in the term 'consubstantial', as I understand it, is that Jesus' substantial form is *exactly* the same as the Father's, meaning that every potential of Jesus' is a potential of the Father's. That is the function of a substantial form. But if Jesus is able to suffer (a passive potential, but a potential nonetheless) then the Father, with the *same* (con-) *substantial form* (-substantial) must be able to suffer because it is a potential of that substantial form.

Lets be honest working 10 or 12 hour days six or seven days a week in a cannery freezer, at a remote location is as much of an cultural and educational experience as spending months in the Anchorage bus stations. The bus station might actuality be better becasue there is always a possibility of meeting some unique Alaskans. Plus there are lots of great things to discover in Anchorage.

You act as if jobs are given out now by committees who are able to perfectly discern the merit of any given candidate and rank him/her against all other candidates.

Besides, even one's accomplishments aren't always due to merit.  Person A got a degree from Harvard University.  He was let in as a legacy admission.  Person B got a degree from U of Ottawa.

So, on the weekends, most MPs do constituency work, and, if they are lucky, maybe catch up with their families.  They get very little time to themselves.  It is an extremely unhealthy lifestyle, that does not aid effectiveness.

Indeed, divorce for a woman was a a sure indicator of a future of destitution.  In US catholic literature on marriage in those days, especially written for pastors, there was no, 'if he hits you, then leave'.

Same mistake that the letter writers make about AL - they do not understand theology and their ecclesiology is fundamental and legal only.  Can anyone say 21st century Pharisees?,0,-2.3878896336562128,2.3878896336562128
304,"(Continuation) I was sent to the pastor's office, because the staff thought I was becoming a satanist. He asked me what was going on. Once told, his respois response was, ""You say Truth will be your guide in this exploration?"" ""Yep. It is my only guide post"". He said,""You promise?""  I said it was a necessary principle to find out what I needed to know and so it was indispensable"".He said, ""ok. You'll be fine."" I never would have dreamed that this journey would lead me to Christianity, let alone Roman Catholicism and especially not the Mass of the Ages, but that pastor knew if I set my sights on the Truth, I'd wind up on Jesus' doorstep eventually.  

Seriously, AnnieO, if you let go of  biased opinions, it's the only place the road to Truth leads. I cannot encapsulate 20 years of philosophy and logic into a comment field for CNR, and my journey would be different than anyone else's, but if you strictly adhere to Truth and, and reason, all roads lead to Rome (pre 1965, I might add)",0,-2.387609598983427,2.387609598983427
3051,"Maslow's observation are wonderful, I use them all the time.  But those levels of self actualization don't explain the differences of how development is not always sequential for individuals.

Did Donald Trump ever experience a lack of food or shelter in his life.  (as a baby he could not provide it,  but he certainly had no reason to ever experience those 'needs'.   How does one have empathy for a condition they never experienced?

Did Donald Trump ever experience safety needs?    Not in terms used in your link.   

Social needs:  At this point I'd have to know more, but going through 3 wives and accumulating a long list of 'enemies' in his business career makes me wonder if he's made it through this level.

Maslow present a path to human self actualization, it presume's these levels happen in sequence and it is a description of a healthy life.   It is not necessarily a tool for examining mental illness.   Trump is functional, but IMO has serious problems with his emotional stability.",0,-2.3864690702127147,2.3864690702127147

2655,"Your claims are inconsistent. You say that government income will rise. But this will only happen if salary increases more than offset the loss of jobs (or if those workers find employment elsewhere). In other words, the government will only ""rub their hands together with glee"" if the policy is a success.

As for workers not being able to afford the restaurants, a moment of thought makes it obvious that for individual worker, the salary increase will more than offset the increase cost of food. A worker paid $3 more per hour for 8 hours gets $24 more per day. If she eats at the restaurant every day, she can afford to spend $24 more on food and still break even. Are you seriously suggesting prices will increase more than that? That would be what, a 100% increase in the price of meals as a result of a 25% increase in the cost of labour. That's absurd. The result is exactly the opposite. Restaurant workers will be able to eat there more often, not less!",0,-2.383449427678452,2.383449427678452
1217,"Aloha Keli`i, thank you for your thoughts on this very important matter. Considering that you advocate against the DOI's offered path towards federal recognition I am wondering what you would suggest is the appropriate alternative?

Dealing with practical matters such as housing, education and healthcare are all important, but still the question of sovereignty lies at the core of so many issues that I believe it should be addressed. Further I feel that at this most auspicious point in time besides saying no to the DOI's plan a true leader would offer an alternative, a constructive, practical, actually achievable alternative path into a future in which the Hawaiian flag can fly proudly over a sovereign Hawaiian Nation once again. Do you envision such a future? Do you have a plan on how we can achieve an end to this matter once and for all?

1853,"If one were to research the history of vaccines what would immediately stand out is the fact that the diseases we vaccinate for were well on the way out before the introduction of the vaccines. Diseases can go through cycles which is why we don't have a bubonic plague epidemic even though there was no vaccine to get rid of it at its height. What makes the most difference anywhere is clean water, improved nutrition, transportation (for nutrient-rich food), education/medical care (knowing how to treat wounds as to avoid tetanus, for example). Also, since smallpox has been mentioned, I would suggest researching the topic thoroughly to find some very surprising facts.",0,-2.3814343102791495,2.3814343102791495
