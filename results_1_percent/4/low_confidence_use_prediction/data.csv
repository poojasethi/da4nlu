Consequently, a U.S. shareholder will recognize gain, but not loss, in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the sum of the fair market value of the CCEP Shares and the amount of Cash Consideration received, over (ii) such shareholder’s adjusted tax basis in the CCE Common Stock exchanged therefor.

I was trying to make a different point. This is not the first time in the Church's history that the language of the culture has changed. The first time round (from Greek to Latin) the Church embraced the change, and as a result its theology was enriched. The Church missed out on another paradigm language change moment at the time of the Reformation. Vatican II had the courage to accept the challenge of the vernacular. 

My basic point is about using the change in language as an opportunity to advance theological thinking, instead of being restricted to answers from the past. (Not saying, let me be clear, we should reject these past attempts, but we need to complement them with newer ones that ""speak"" to the contemporary world.)",0,-0.45098381488595773,0.45098381488595773

2441,The replacement cost of a battery for Nissan Leaf is listed at US$5499.00.  Your Honda Odyssey has a rather bad reputation which is unusual but the repair cost for the vehicle transmission averages at US$3423.00 so it would have been cheaper to repair your Honda.  Regarding your Leaf I note that owners seem to be extremely happy with their vehicles at first but after three years a noticeable drop off in range of 30-50% is noted on the various consumer sites I've visited.  From what I can tell it's not the battery that's failing but individual cells within the battery pack itself.  Nissan offers little in the way of a solution except replacement hopefully within the warranty.  Fortunately this problem has become common enough for a new industry to arise which offers a solution namely in the form of a rebuilt salvaged battery.

I happen to own a condo that fits this description in Salt Lake. It's ugly as can be but I love the place. We don't have to air-condition it because we get plenty of wind. It's relatively affordable.  Condos like these have a much smaller footprint than single family homes.

Indeed, divorce for a woman was a a sure indicator of a future of destitution.  In US catholic literature on marriage in those days, especially written for pastors, there was no, 'if he hits you, then leave'. More like: 'if he hits you, then try harder to love him and be a good wife.'
- So, while grandmother might have known that the US bishop rescinded in 1884 their 1840 degree that divorce incurs automatic excommunication, she would be still certain that her vows meant something, and that her church, in those days, would have little sympathy for her as divorced or separated.",1,0.22531516320053413,0.22531516320053413

For each friend you have in their 50's and 60's who won the lottery by owning there is one who didn't -  which is worse being 20 and suddenly having an uphill battle to own, or being 50 and suddenly having an uphill battle to own? The 50 year old has no meaningful chance to become an owner and so in two decades will suddenly be facing retirement, and a fixed and reduced income, in a place with sky high rents that keep going up faster than inflation. The 20 year old has 45 years to prepare for that eventuality. In reality for both the likely solution is that they will be forced to move somewhere new, away from friends and family. Is that harder for the older or the young? I'd argue that it is demonstrably harder for the older person.
