2507,"Back in the early 70's we stressed tested a grade 5 class of boys and girls. Their ages were  a range of 10 and 11. What we found back then was that the fittest kids have oxygen uptakes ( MVO 2) in the high 70's and one was an 81. For perspective for adults, this put some kids in the range of world class middle distance runners or elite cyclists. Since the majority of kids were pre adolescent, this is quite normal. We noticed that once the kids hit high school their oxygen uptakes dramatically decreased. 
So what I'm saying is that if we influence children with regular exercise when their young, then their natural drop off will be less when they hit puberty. 
Picard is right. Kids are meant to move constantly. A 15 minute run/ brisk walk is a start. Not a solution. Everything fitness related starts at home very early. Parents can be a solution .

I was trying to make a different point. This is not the first time in the Church's history that the language of the culture has changed.

The Church missed out on another paradigm language change moment at the time of the Reformation. Vatican II had the courage to accept the challenge of the vernacular. 

My basic point is about using the change in language as an opportunity to advance theological thinking, instead of being restricted to answers from the past.

It was the great work of the post-Concil years to work out practical mechanisms for the collegial expression of authority in the church. Various expressions of collegiality emerged: Synods, Councils (National, Diocesan, Parish), and Conferences. The work, though well begun, was not complete, nor would it ever be complete. However, Pope John Paul II intervened to strip or weaken the authority of every collegial body that emerged after the Council. When the US Bishops were working on their pastoral letter, “The Challenge of Peace”, John Paul did not object to their teaching -- he was to their left; he objected to their method: they were (gasp!) listening to experts and ordinary people from a variety of walks of life; not all of them clerics; not all of them even Catholics.

The language that was objectionable to Leo was removed in 1662.

The adjective 'consubstantial', for its part, could also lead a praying individual to a heterodox conclusion about the relationship between the Father and Jesus.

The idea expressed in the term 'consubstantial', as I understand it, is that Jesus' substantial form is *exactly* the same as the Father's, meaning that every potential of Jesus' is a potential of the Father's. That is the function of a substantial form. But if Jesus is able to suffer (a passive potential, but a potential nonetheless) then the Father, with the *same* (con-) *substantial form* (-substantial) must be able to suffer because it is a potential of that substantial form.

 Astruc's methods were then used, when German scholors picked up the study. With considerable funding by the German Chancellor Bismark, for his own ends.

The Franciscan friars are members of the Conference of Superiors of Major Religious Orders of Men, who has issued, for example, a signed rebutal  to Benedict XVI's directive to exclude homosexuals from priestly formation, have been leaders in liturgical reforms, produced much of the most prayerful sacred music in the vernacular, and so on.

What did Hir (his/her) coming demonstrate about God and humanity, about God in humanity?  Does God evolve, too?

But, lets start on a smaller scale, say with the role of women in the Church and in the world.

Indeed, divorce for a woman was a a sure indicator of a future of destitution.  In US catholic literature on marriage in those days, especially written for pastors, there was no, 'if he hits you, then leave'. More like: 'if he hits you, then try harder to love him and be a good wife.'
- So, while grandmother might have known that the US bishop rescinded in 1884 their 1840 degree that divorce incurs automatic excommunication, she would be still certain that her vows meant something, and that her church, in those days, would have little sympathy for her as divorced or separated.",0,-2.881136566911113,2.881136566911113

Fixating faith consciousness in presumed old-time understandings of static nature, flies in the face of Natural Law. 'Cosmic Religion's First Lessons' still control with respect to understanding 'Primary Scripture' and Natural Law. Evolving consciousness compels openness to the transforming powers of the laws of nature.

American lay Catholic education pretty much stopped with the Baltimore Catechism, a book that raised being simplistic to an art form.

Based only on his public image and statements, I think there are two crucial observations. 

First, he is adamant to actualize the eccesiology of V2, which P6, JP2 and P16 have systematically ignored, preferring V1. Second, he is utterly focused on a Christianity of service of others. The latter is, I think, both an expression of his own enormous heart and a conscious decision to point forward in a direction the neither side can gainsay. And this is the characteristic that seems to make him adorable to just about anyone of good will.

But in the longer term, IMHO, it is the first propensity that is most important.

107,"""Harper ran deficits during a global financial crisis.""
He had us in a deficit situation BEFORE the recession hit and created a Made By Harper version a few years later.

""He paid off considerable debt pre-2008 and left the country with a surplus in 2015.""
He inherited an economy running on all cylinders and great fiscal shape. He couldn't spend fast enough in the first year and half to eat through what the LPC left him with. And his surplus was fake. He sold billions in GM shares well over a billion in properties, took a billion from contingency and a few more from EI. The surplus was every bit as fake as  Harper.

Dubia are formal questions brought before the Pope and to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith asking for clarifications on particular issues concerning doctrine or practice.
What is peculiar about these inquiries is that they are worded in a way that requires a “Yes” or “No” answer, without theological argumentation. This way of addressing the Apostolic See is not an invention of our own; it is an age-old practice.

You're right that the four Cardinals are better informed than me.  However, they are a tiny minority.  Only four of a college of over 120?
