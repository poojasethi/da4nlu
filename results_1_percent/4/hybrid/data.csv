2507,"Back in the early 70's we stressed tested a grade 5 class of boys and girls. Their ages were  a range of 10 and 11. What we found back then was that the fittest kids have oxygen uptakes ( MVO 2) in the high 70's and one was an 81. For perspective for adults, this put some kids in the range of world class middle distance runners or elite cyclists. Since the majority of kids were pre adolescent, this is quite normal. We noticed that once the kids hit high school their oxygen uptakes dramatically decreased. 
So what I'm saying is that if we influence children with regular exercise when their young, then their natural drop off will be less when they hit puberty. 
Picard is right. Kids are meant to move constantly. A 15 minute run/ brisk walk is a start. Not a solution. Everything fitness related starts at home very early. Parents can be a solution . It can start by walking to school, less screen time, more family activities where fitness in normal. Just like the 70's.",0,-3.524387254028184,3.524387254028184

The Church missed out on another paradigm language change moment at the time of the Reformation. Vatican II had the courage to accept the challenge of the vernacular. 

My basic point is about using the change in language as an opportunity to advance theological thinking, instead of being restricted to answers from the past.

Your Honda Odyssey has a rather bad reputation which is unusual but the repair cost for the vehicle transmission averages at US$3423.00 so it would have been cheaper to repair your Honda.  Regarding your Leaf I note that owners seem to be extremely happy with their vehicles at first but after three years a noticeable drop off in range of 30-50% is noted on the various consumer sites I've visited.  From what I can tell it's not the battery that's failing but individual cells within the battery pack itself.  Nissan offers little in the way of a solution except replacement hopefully within the warranty.  Fortunately this problem has become common enough for a new industry to arise which offers a solution namely in the form of a rebuilt salvaged battery.  Sort of like rebuilding your Honda's transmission.  I note that Nissan only guaranteed the battery for 5 years at 70% range.

If successful, the costs will not be paid by those who use it as you suggest.  They will be paid by all the taxpayers in the community.  In addition, the state retirement systems are operated by the state with no local government/school district input.  One of the reasons the costs are as hig as they are was a mistake made by a former state actuary.

997,"This motu proprio and the work of liturgical reform prior to, at the time of, and after the Second Vatican Council are, to me, an attempt at applying the principle of subsidiarity, from the sphere of Morality (non-ritual worship), to the sphere of Liturgy (ritual worship).

These two theological spheres are 'practical' means of seeking understanding via faith (theology). They needn't be bogged down by the arcane terminologies of imperfect philosophies (e.g. Aristotelianism, Thomism) applied in more systematic means of doing theology.

Understanding and expression are very important in the sphere of Liturgy. If we don't allow Liturgy to develop liturgically, but instead use our imperfect philosophical-theological lexicon to supress expression rather than to guide it, then how can we model the parrhesia of the Church that we read about in the Acts of the Apostles?

I thank God, and Pope Francis, who I believe serves as a channel of God, for this development and I hope that it bears life.",0,-2.6346701197665703,2.6346701197665703

This dates from Rerum novarum [ Pope Leo XIII, 1891], which confirmed the need for the state to intervene to protect workers and poor people.  This is supported by the writings of Aquinas who stated that the ""common good"" of all the people is the main duty of the state.  Other encyclicals that further develop these concepts of the duties of the state toward the people, especially the poor are:

1.  Quadragesimo anno [Pope Pius XI, 1931]
2.  Mater et magistra, [Pope John XXIII, 1961]
3.  Populorum progressio' [Pope Paul VI, 1967]
4. On Social Concern [Pope John Paul II, 1987]

""Economic justice of All"" [1986]

Hopefully the Church is getting better and wiser in dealing with evolution.

At the end of his popular book, A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME, physicist Stephen Hawking, who sets out the basic structure of the universe, asks a famous question: ""What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe?""  In the integrity of his adherence to atheism, he leaves he question open.

Faith offers a different option, daring to believe that it is God's own Sprit who breathes the fire of life into these equation, indeed, the One who fired up the equations to begin with.

The initial reaction to Bishop Robinson's election (and approval by the national church) for some of those reacting to it was, as you state, to fly off and align themselves with homophobic African bishops. However, since then, they formed the Anglican Church in North America (ACNA).  In several dioceses, parishes allying themselves with ANCA have engaged in litigation over church property, which has been very expensive for both groups, with mixed results. In VA, TEC prevailed; in SC, ANCA appears to have a good case.  In no case I know of, has a seceding parish returned to TEC when it lost its property.

This is a difficult situation for TEC and has strained its relations with the wider Anglican Communion. However, TEC has remained resolute in its support of full LGBT rights. You might check out your local Episcopal Church some Sunday morning!",0,-0.06460844183377246,0.06460844183377246

Yeah - this was a typical Pell move - he didn't care how much it hurt them, they were poor, black, minority, no money, no influence.  

I think Neocats can earn their way in but should not be imposed and there has to be room for those who do not buy into the Neocat form of Catholicism.  Neocat's aren't very good at that - making room for another way, are they?",0,0.0036723254999431187,0.0036723254999431187

4451,"Walter, one book which sets out your view is Gary Willis' 'Sins of the Papacy.' In it he lists how the Catholic Church specifically (as opposed to Christianity) set itself against every significant development in human thinking, science etc.. and was also proved wrong historically on almost every single occasion.

The following is a clip of a very famous debate which took place between Michael Palin and John Cleese of Monty Python's Life of Brian and Malcolm Muggeridge and an Anglican Bishop in which the claim is made - by Muggeridge and the Bishop -that Christianity is the bedrock of knowledge/art etc..

Muggeridge, later found out to be an alcoholic and womaniser, and the Bishop, a secret homosexual and alcoholic, showed themselves to be exactly what Life of Brian was targeting, (not Jesus.) 

Both men were not defenders of Christianity's huge influence on the human mind, they were in fact, 'very naughty boys.'",0,0.003506658349873515,0.003506658349873515

The thought of anyone going to Hell is simply beyond their comprehension because God is ""all merciful"", particularly so in this pontificate. Penance {and sacramental confession}are anathema because they are relativists, and who is anyone to judge their subjective mindset. Lastly, The Social Reign of Christ the King is the real doozy here because it recognizes {primarily} that The Catholic Church is indeed the one true Mystical Body--outside of which there is no salvation. In a word, they reject Fatima because Fatima--even though only 100 years ago--reaffirms Catholic Tradition.",0,0.0017155235291137494,0.0017155235291137494
