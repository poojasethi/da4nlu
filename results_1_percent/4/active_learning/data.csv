674,"I'm surprised that you say such a thing! I haven't seen a single instance of the R-G forgiving NK. What I see is straightforward reporting of the situation, which has been blown out of proportion by loud public posturing and threats by Kim and Trump both, each escalating the other's schoolyard taunts. This loudmouth yelling plays well to the meathead faction in America, but it accomplishes nothing, increases world anxiety, and holds the threat of actual military action, which isn't necessary.

Except by diplomacy including economic sanctions, nothing can be done to stop Kim from acquiring nuclear ICBMs in the next decade. Would he use them, knowing his nation would be obliterated? Why, I ask?  Pakistan, a chaotic nation, has nukes and hates India, which also has nukes. Have they used them? No, because they understand the consequences.

As several on this forum have pointed out, we ought to hold out a carrot to NK, inclusion in trade with the West. Peace would follow.",0,0.1729342678043806,0.1729342678043806

1. Why are people (particularly youth) fleeing the East Coast, especially NFLD, for Ontario, Alberta, BC?
2. Having answered that, why would any sane person expect immigrants to remain there for any length of time?

England couldn't get rid of NFLD fast enough in 1942. It's stuck out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean so everything has to be shipped out to it, ergo commodities cost a fortune compared to the mainland. No businessman in his right mind would invest in a large scale endeavor out there and expect people to work for $15.00 an hour when a liter of gas almost $1.40 today and a two-litre carton of milk costs $4.00.

Hopefully the Church is getting better and wiser in dealing with evolution.

At the end of his popular book, A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME, physicist Stephen Hawking, who sets out the basic structure of the universe, asks a famous question: ""What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe?""  In the integrity of his adherence to atheism, he leaves he question open.

Faith offers a different option, daring to believe that it is God's own Sprit who breathes the fire of life into these equation, indeed, the One who fired up the equations to begin with.

""The finding that only 28% of the female offenders in the Quebec sample had previously been subjected to violence by their victim is in contrast to the popular belief and reports that indicate that most female-perpetrated spousal homicide occurs in self-defense or in reaction to long-term abuse. In fact, women rarely gave a warning before killing their mates. Most did not suffer from a mental illness, although one-fifth were acutely intoxicated at the time of the killing. In the vast majority of cases of women who killed their mates, there were very few indicators that might have signaled the risk and helped predict the violent lethal behavior.""",0,-0.08621532189317027,0.08621532189317027

In it he lists how the Catholic Church specifically (as opposed to Christianity) set itself against every significant development in human thinking, science etc.. and was also proved wrong historically on almost every single occasion.

The following is a clip of a very famous debate which took place between Michael Palin and John Cleese of Monty Python's Life of Brian and Malcolm Muggeridge and an Anglican Bishop in which the claim is made - by Muggeridge and the Bishop -that Christianity is the bedrock of knowledge/art etc..

Muggeridge, later found out to be an alcoholic and womaniser, and the Bishop, a secret homosexual and alcoholic, showed themselves to be exactly what Life of Brian was targeting, (not Jesus.)

Rasmea Yousef Odeh, a convicted terrorist. Odeh, a Palestinian, was convicted in Israel in 1970 for her part in two terrorist bombings, one of which killed two students while they were shopping for groceries. She spent 10 years in prison for her crimes. She then managed to become a US citizen in 2004 by lying about her past (great detective work, INS: Next time, use Google) but was subsequently convicted, in 2014, of immigration fraud for the falsehoods. However, she won the right to a new trial (set for this spring) by claiming she had been suffering from PTSD at the time she lied on her application. Oh, and in her time as a citizen, she worked for a while as an ObamaCare navigator.

     For example: if life is sacred from conception to natural death, what of the Buddhists killed by Diem, a professed Catholic in Vietnam, whose oppressive actions led to the self-immolation of Buddhist monks? Did other than some lay Catholics protest? Where was the censure due his actions from the clergy, from the Vatican?

1066,"In fact, the situation in TEC (as American Episcopalians generally refer to themselves) is more complicated than what you describe. The initial reaction to Bishop Robinson's election (and approval by the national church) for some of those reacting to it was, as you state, to fly off and align themselves with homophobic African bishops. However, since then, they formed the Anglican Church in North America (ACNA).  In several dioceses, parishes allying themselves with ANCA have engaged in litigation over church property, which has been very expensive for both groups, with mixed results. In VA, TEC prevailed; in SC, ANCA appears to have a good case.  In no case I know of, has a seceding parish returned to TEC when it lost its property.

This is a difficult situation for TEC and has strained its relations with the wider Anglican Communion. However, TEC has remained resolute in its support of full LGBT rights. You might check out your local Episcopal Church some Sunday morning!",0,0.00042093365474049627,0.00042093365474049627
