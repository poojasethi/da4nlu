Isaiah 'wrote' in politically and socially very uncertain times: the Assyrian empire had already swallowed up the northern kingdom, Israel, and the southern kingdom, Judah, might be next?

First, it is a practical work-around to the Pharisaical preoccupation with legal formulations that has gripped the institutional Church in matters related to marriage and the family.

Second, a pastoral focus gives breathing room for people to center themselves on the Spirit of Christ in their hearts.  This centering moves toward the reign of God that Jesus preached.

Muller and the four cardinals don't appreciate how much distance there is from the Church when a person struggling to discern their conscience cannot be confident that a pastor will encourage that discernment.  Francis is encouraging that discernment.

And, in the end, that discernment restores the primacy of the great commandments to love God and neighbor.  Lack of ""exceptions"" to a subordinate principle -- such as indissolubility -- risks denying the primacy of love.",0,-3.39007997372385,3.39007997372385

The key issue is whether one regards Tradition as virtually unchanged, or constantly changing. Once one grasps the constancy of theological development in the past, the Tradition becomes a great friend, for it is the unassailable warrant for the changes we desperately need today. 

Incidentally, in my view, it is not just historical depth in time but also historical breadth in geography (the Byzantine, Syrian, Egyptian Traditions) of the first millennium that warrant change. Since the Great Church (as come call it) of the first millennium was largely united, all the theologies of  all those culturally diverse Churches are fully valid today as markers in the past of what could be in the future. You may recall for example, that before the two recent synods, the wide range of possible solutions for remarried Catholics included the practice of the Byzantine Church.

Breaks on me as my meager flesh breaks down—
The soul delights in that extremity.
Blessed the meek; they shall inherit wrath;

The church is judging and punishing anyone it withholds Holy Eucharist from because we do not know what is in the heart of the people who have divorced or re-married but are keeping them from partaking.  

Jesus did not tell us to withhold Eucharist from anyone for any reason.

Then Jesus responded to those who had murmured against Him, saying, “For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost” (Luke 19:10).

Those of us who were academically inclined put on our walking shoes, got on our bikes or arranged car-pools and made the trip. 

My point is that a car really isn't necessary to travel such short distances. Transportation isn't the barrier. I suspect that most of the parents of students at South have better educations and appreciate the value of education far more than the parents who send their children to the failed NEHS do.

Causes or making a statement has become fashionable , where once it was ""owned"" by the university crowd, it now attracts everyone, primarily because it is easy as in the case of petitions. In the disposable age, causes or protests erupt and disappear as quickly as they come, as there is always something else around the corner, and this will be no different.",0,-2.5868802874458874,2.5868802874458874

Catalonia can't pretend that Spain's constitution, which Catalans overwhelmingly approved a few years ago, doesn't govern its actions. If Spain's constitution doesn't make provision for secession (many constitutions do not) then Catalonia must negotiate the terms of a secession while continuing to abide by all other requirements of the constitution. This means, for example, that Catalonia must follow rulings made under the country's legal system.

Short of a revolution, no part of a country gets to unilaterally declare that it no longer abides by the constitution.",0,-2.5860406825556304,2.5860406825556304

1719,"The kuleana of ethical journalism is to report fair and unbiased, verified facts (truth) about people and events (news) relevant to its subscriber market (audience). This demands journalistic integrity which begins when an editor assigns a journalist to cover a specific topic and that journalist following through with due diligence in the form of researching the topic and then going out into the field to gather facts from which the journalist constructs a ""story"" which presents those facts in a fair and unbiased way, bereft of opinion.

Yet sometimes a story fairly begs for coverage without any interest from media.

I'm the Minister of Information of Ke Aupuni o Hawai'i, the Hawaiian Kingdom government. We're in the process of reinstating Hawai'i's lawful government and reestablishing our sovereign independence yet no Hawai'i news media will cover what is perhaps the biggest news story in Hawai'i's history since Cook's arrival.

In the next few years, electric transit buses will be a regular site.  Turning the guideway into a self driving Managed Lane is the best solution.  The guideway as planned does not make good use of  the space.  24 rail cars per hour on an elevated two lane highway is wasteful.  Combining self driving transit vehicles and Managed Lanes will be superior to rail in every category - speed, capacity, lower cost, safety etc.  Adding self driving vehicles for emergency use, and personal use will increase guideway usage and decrease vehicles from H-1.  Self-driving transit buses can provide all the transit that is needed in a TOD development as well.

  Everyone I've ever had does something else for a living. They use uber as some extra money on the side. Especially during big events in there area when there are more than enough customers to go around for them and the cab drivers. 
 They fill in during high demand times. You know, those times where there is s high demand for cabs but since the number of cabs is static, riders end up waiting.....and waiting......and waiting for a cab. 

    Perfect example:
   Yesterday my son needed a ride from Scottsdale to the Phoenix airport at 5am. It's about a 30 min ride. A cab company quoted us $60-70 based on traffic. 
    
   We prescheduled an uber the night before for 4:30 am for $27. Turns out the driver lives in Scottsdale and works at the airport. (Drives a new BMW) he told my son he can almost always pick up a rider on his commute to and from work.

There was an attempt to remove ROTC from campus due to an anti-gay policy of the military at the time. I argues that ROTC's removal would limit resources for many students in that program and would have a high impact on minority students and poorer rural students. There were good arguments on all sides (all sides did agree that the discrimination should end, but the question was would ROTC ban be a good response). This was a heated debate but we managed to listen to each other.

From 1951 (the end of the Marshall Plan) to 1981 (the beginning of the Reagan tax changes), both GDP and private sector jobs grew at an accelerating rate. See invisiblegoose.com for charts. For the same number of years after that change, growth in both GDP and private sector jobs slowed (and even went negative). 
.
There was no magic involved, and no sudden change in the world economies. In the earlier period, the combination of relatively high top-end tax rates, multiple progressive brackets, and generous targeted tax deductions provided a significant incentive to create jobs for American workers and to pay them well. While many jobs were offshored during that period, newly created jobs more than made up for them. The Reagan tax structure (and rate) changes crippled those incentives and investment in domestic job creation fell.",0,-2.55664928575084,2.55664928575084
