Any male can loiter in these places and walk in on any girl or woman in the shower, including stripping down and showering next to them.  
The initiative does not use the word transgender because the current rule does not either.  The current rule applies to ""gender expression or gender identity"" which is ambiguous enough to allow any male to claim one of 58 gender identities as listed on Facebook.  No proof is possible, which is why the current rule strips women of their ability to question any naked male walking into the shower with them or with little girls.

Basically he's buying votes and painting small businesses as the villains.

The spending and borrowing binge is really part of the plan so Canadians will have to sell off public assets and private business will be made unsustainable due to high, punitive taxes.

This does not mean he approved of her behavior.  Jesus does not approve of murder but murderers are given forgiveness from God.  An addict may not be able to quit using drugs which are causing him to steal or do other crimes but God will still forgive the addict.  God recognizes we get ourselves trapped sometimes & forgives. 

Jesus teaches: Judge the behavior not the person, including marriage behavior.  Teach divorce is wrong, and help those who want help, but do not condemn, those who sin because you are a sinner too.

In fact, for a time this belief was stronger among blacks than whites. However, the rise of a more militant narrative on racism during the ensuing period has changed perceptions within the black community. This suggests that if you tell people they're collectively victimized, many will apparently assume this to be an incontrovertible fact, whatever their own personal experiences. Rather than acknowledging the value of incremental progress, many will instead focus on events and statistics that sustain a belief in their own victimization, thereby rendering such victimization a form of self-fulfilling prophesy.

Children' hands, knuckles, were hit hard and the children were made to stand on stools and chairs so that they could be denounced as 'friends of the devil.""
