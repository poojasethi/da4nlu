In a nutshell, Catholic teaching is that when you have sex it should be with the person you are sacramentally united to in marriage and you should be open to children.  You cannot try to stop the sexual act from being procreative, but you are certainly allowed to enjoy sex that is not procreative, even if you know it is likely it will be naturally not procreative.  There is a huge body of explanation on this called the theology of the body, but the reasoning boils not to life issues, but to human dignity and love.",0,-0.12184374065279657,0.12184374065279657

This heresy is nothing new, and has been anathemized against the followers of monanus who had female priests.

In fact most romano-graeco cults had female priests, it would not have been scandalous at the time to have female priests from the beginning, and yet God the Son chose to make a parallel priesthood like the one he began with Moses and Aron and all the Levites.

There are no theological, biblical or traditional grounds for ordination of women.

The desert mothers, who were wealthy women of high class before their conversion never sought to undermine the church teachings, rather they became like icons of Christ and rendered great service to the Church.

3838,"Wow, they visited a whole 20 sites in other countries and the United States and performed 50 interviews, worldwide. The rest was just looking at other reports. This was a poll, not research.  The authors have a “ law and order” approach and do not even consider alternative solutions. I read another one of Winship’s “studies.”His solution to violent recidivists - whom he concedes learned to be violent while in prison - more of the same.  Very useful. Yes, let’s take these folks, especially the young,  and lock them away in prison for years, so when their sentences are done they come out all the worse for being incarcerated. Then - and this is the brilliant part - let’s hurry up and lock them away again. 

Then there is the fact that imprisionment creates and/or exacerbates mental illness.  Virtually every person in prison has a mental illness of some sort. 

Seems to me the purpose of incarceration in this country is to make people ill & turn them into criminals or worse criminals.",1,0.006407092021330829,0.006407092021330829

Prices in the decaying small towns are low, but not collapsing, as most of the grey hairs who have their retirement homes there have pensions.

The entire system needs constant growth, or it collapses.  If jobs and values dry up, immigrants will bail and go elsewhere.

Men are visually stimulated sexually much more than women.  The multi-billion dollar pornography industry seems to show that.  

So a man, who is visually stimulated by observing female genitalia, projects that concept on those he desires and thinks a view of his equipment will have a similar result on the women he exposes himself to.
