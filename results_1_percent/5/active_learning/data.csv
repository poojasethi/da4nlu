And here is my comment....

These supposed 'leaders' use words and sentiments rather than action to react unto the murderers that foment their own actions within the murder of innocents.

Why does not Israel suffer these same results though they are within, literally, the middle of nations that support, and reward individuals such as these cowards?

The fault lies within those that are fully aware that said individuals are planning, and capable of said actions, but  do not report it unto the authorities, and therefore are just as culpable as the murderer themselves, and within that extent, every individual that has knowledge of said action should be held just as responsible as the murderer themselves, and judged accordingly, just as the now dead murderer.

There are methods to identify and root out these murderers, and should be taken",1,-0.27970839816739757,0.27970839816739757

1.  Yes, he lost.  The ONLY reason Brauchler took that case to trial was to get a death conviction.  Thats it.  The defense offered a life sentence and he refused.  Him taking the case to trial and wasting millions of dollars resulted in NOTHING his defense attorneys had not already offered.  

2. Being mentally ill and insane are 2 different things.  Look them up.

3. Reports were that there was at least 1 juror who was a hard 'no' while there were 1-2 reportedly ""on the fence"".  The jury decided amongst themselves that if ANY of them were a solid no - they would stop deliberating since in Colorado it needs to be unanimous.  

4. It costs more tax payer money to sentence someone to death, than to put them in prison for life.  Lots of facts and figures for you to find that show that is true.

Want to try again, or do you want to just continue to make up YOUR own ""facts""?",0,-0.004652166578069217,0.004652166578069217

835,You seem to believe I am omniscient and know your every post. How about you prove your claim. Provide links to all the posts you claim to have made during your suspension?  LOL. But I guess snark and nastiness are more in keeping with some posters interpretation of Christian conduct?  No lantern under a basket!  Show those catholic Christian ideals for all to see!

But I see what you and a few others do on these forums, being aggressive and mean. You have every right to do so, and I have every right to comment on your tone and call you on your behavior. Of course you are mirroring the behavior of the President, so there is no surprise. So you all calling me  and others ""jerk"" or ""snowflake"" or whatever demeaning phrases you want to come up with is OK, but there must be a better way. Something more constructive. When we go back and forth, I feel like we are both just tools of oligarchs. While we squabble, ""left and right"", money and power keeps getting concentrated into the hands of a few. By his actions, and that of Republicans in  Congress, the President and his cronies are all about the concentration of wealth.

plain and simple - he is not intelligent, he is a poor communicator, he is arrogant and unethical

2787,"You have made a blanket statement to the effect that the actions of police reflect ""our"" values. You said that even though you imply the police don't reflect your values. I could say that's truly self-righteous of you, and maybe indeed you think the rest of us feel that black men running from police questioning over a broken taillight deserve to be shot in the back and killed. That police action doesn't reflect my values, and I am offended to be included in your blanket statement. Judging by the single holdout in the trial of the officer, about one in twelve people approve of unjustified police murder of an unarmed man not at that moment known to have committed a specific crime, who represented no threat to the officer or to anyone else.

However, I agree that when we disrespect another person for reasons of racial, sexual, cultural, or ethnic bigotry, yes, we contribute to ""the problem"".",0,0.001940086795195306,0.001940086795195306
