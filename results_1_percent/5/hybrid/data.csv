1122,"The SDA church is predicated on the presumption of voluntary participation.

Unfortunately, the longer one remains in any leadership role, the greater the temptation becomes to develop a sense of entitlement.  This is true both individually and institutionally.  And it applies with especial vengeance to those who ascend to the higher tiers of an organization.

In this regard, I find the various studies that seek to streamline church operations, that tend to focus on how to reduce overhead at the local conference level, to be missing the mark.

Take the Eucharist. For 1500+ years it was explained in terms of pre-Christian religious ritual, like sacrifice and altars. The final stage in a sacrifice is the sharing of the victim to enable a distribution of the numinous among the believers.
The same ritual can be reinterpreted from a different perspective. Instead of the sacrifice as explanatory key, the meal can be understood as Christ's purpose. Christ died so that we can share in his life. The concluding communal meal is a more effective key today than the rarely experienced ritual sacrifice, in a Church based on communion.
One event, understood in two ways, can easily become two different ways of experiencing a common practice. I guess i could have just said Extraordinary and ordinary forms coexist.",0,-4.397713470547269,4.397713470547269

To generalize that, Aquinas says the God is pure act, with no potential to be anything else. When we act, we change: when God acts, God acts. We see God act and conclude God changes. God is not unchanging in the way a rock is unchanging, unmoving, still. God is always acting, it is the divine nature.

So it follows that it can only be 'merciful' to open Communion up to the divorced-and-remarried, and indeed (following the logic further) to all comers.
While we can't expect to hammer out a complete Eucharistic theology in a combox, I'd suggest this view is in many ways deficient.

The language that was objectionable to Leo was removed in 1662.

For all of their  ""progressive"" rhetoric, Eugene's current ""leaders"" clearly have not figured out how one gets from grand words to tough, balanced decisions that a broader public can eventually accept (and may, one day, applaud).

It became normative to claim ""not a REAL marriage to begin with"" and bureaucracy was eased, but the wink and nod remained. Many confessors and pastors have similarly winked and nodded for divorced/remarried couples in the spirit of mercy, understanding and often the existence of a new family setting.  This isn't new, it is merely out in the open and subject to more ""official"" discernment.

2. Being mentally ill and insane are 2 different things.  Look them up.

3. Reports were that there was at least 1 juror who was a hard 'no' while there were 1-2 reportedly ""on the fence"".  The jury decided amongst themselves that if ANY of them were a solid no - they would stop deliberating since in Colorado it needs to be unanimous.

Cops aren't all good! Then there is the antiquated ""brotherhood"" mentality that needs to be shaken to the core. Look at the numerous harassment cases in Canada for female police members?
