1122,"The SDA church is predicated on the presumption of voluntary participation.

Unfortunately, the longer one remains in any leadership role, the greater the temptation becomes to develop a sense of entitlement.  This is true both individually and institutionally.  And it applies with especial vengeance to those who ascend to the higher tiers of an organization.

In this regard, I find the various studies that seek to streamline church operations, that tend to focus on how to reduce overhead at the local conference level, to be missing the mark.

791,"""""I would make it clear that not all discussions of doctrinal, moral or pastoral issues need to be settled by interventions of the magisterium. ""

I think this depends on an understanding of the English language verb ""settled;"" accepting that this sentence was almost certainly not drafted in English originally.

""...doctrinal, moral or pastoral issues need to be settled by interventions of the magisterium. Unity of teaching and practice is certainly necessary in the Church, ...""

I warm much more to the start of this second sentence when it comes to things mentioned specifically by Christ in the Gospel.

""...Unity of teaching and practice is certainly necessary in the Church, but this does not preclude various ways of interpreting some aspects of that teaching or drawing certain consequences from it. ""

3659,"I will admit that this is easier to understand in terms of unity of teaching with variety in application, but we are a sacramental church, so unity of practice should be doable. I'm not sure I am up to it, but maybe somebody is.
Take the Eucharist. For 1500+ years it was explained in terms of pre-Christian religious ritual, like sacrifice and altars. The final stage in a sacrifice is the sharing of the victim to enable a distribution of the numinous among the believers.
The same ritual can be reinterpreted from a different perspective. Instead of the sacrifice as explanatory key, the meal can be understood as Christ's purpose. Christ died so that we can share in his life. The concluding communal meal is a more effective key today than the rarely experienced ritual sacrifice, in a Church based on communion.

2290,"This past summer I was in a discussion about whether God changes. We discovered Aquinas handles it in a very interesting way.

God does not change in the way we change. We actualizze our potential to be on the other side of the room by moving to the other side of the room. God is everywhere, so God is on the other side of the room not by actualizing a potential, but by being on the other side of the room.

To generalize that, Aquinas says the God is pure act, with no potential to be anything else. When we act, we change: when God acts, God acts. We see God act and conclude God changes. God is not unchanging in the way a rock is unchanging, unmoving, still. God is always acting, it is the divine nature.

I mention this in no small part because as she notes, we're ""due"" for another such period.

One thing common to successful left wing movements, and I tend to think that successful right wing government policies have the same, is putting pragmatism and economic realism over ideology.

You are wrong on both counts.

What Alliance claimed was that what matters is whether nature has a greater influence or whether nurture has a greater influence.

What I pointed out was that no, the controversial matter would remain EVEN IF nature and nurture were each contributing identically, at 50% each.

And that controversial matter is whether or not a workplace or field should be eyed with concern if it has failed to bring on board ""enough"" women or not.

That is the eye of concern that fundamentally underlies the narrative hitting the newspapers and TVs in recent days.

Danny, I find it very strange that church records don't show anyone other than EGW as having the gift of Prophecy. And besides, the writings of anyone who believes in Christ can be inspiring; and afterwards regarded by others as God-inspired. So where does that leave all the believers today in regards to the gift of prophecy and inspired writings, or rather, are believers less gifted than she was? I don't think so. Believing we are less gifted would be denying the indwelling Spirit of God. People need to live for Christ today and stop resorting to writings of someone who has lived almost 200 years ago; using them for their guide and spiritual teaching.

The New Testament is filled with stories of what one must do and not do to inherit the Kingdom, and Catholic doctrine codifies it.  But good luck finding a Church nowadays that teaches it. Even the Holy Father promotes the ""just be nice"" teaching over the what Catholicism has taught for centuries.  And then the media cherry picks and promotes, e.g., ""Who am I to judge?"" as if that is the totality of Catholic teaching. 

The 2 greatest commandments are not simple, because love is not simple.  That's why the rest of the New Testament is so important; because it tells us what it means to love God and to love one another.",0,-3.3331851672724735,3.3331851672724735

Also in the past century bishops from the Old Catholic Church (recognized as valid by Rome) have participated in numerous episcopal consecrations in the C of E. Apostolicae Curae's main points rested on the wording in the BCP as revised in 1552 under Edward VI, relegated to the dustbin by Mary I between 1553 and 1558, and then reimposed in 1559 by her sister Elizabeth. The language that was objectionable to Leo was removed in 1662. From Rome's perspective, all legitimately ordained/consecrated priests and bishops had died out by that point, and the wording in the BCP meant no one ordained since that point was valid. With the wording restored about 100 years later and the participation of bishops from the Old Catholic Church since the 20th century, it is possible/likely that the impediment Leo recognized no longer exists.",0,-3.302031722431982,3.302031722431982

1)  There seems to be a view of the Eucharist proposed by some (including perhaps the present pope) that verges on magical thinking:  the notion that the Eucharist is some sort of spiritual vitamin that perks us up--the corollary being that if you don't receive Communion you run the risk of becoming spiritually malnourished.  So it follows that it can only be 'merciful' to open Communion up to the divorced-and-remarried, and indeed (following the logic further) to all comers.
While we can't expect to hammer out a complete Eucharistic theology in a combox, I'd suggest this view is in many ways deficient.  An alternative is one in which the Eucharist encourages us to repent of our sins and reform our lives.  Instead of insisting that the Eucharist be supplied to us, we should move towards personal holiness and thus be bring ourselves closer to the sacrament.",0,-3.1429410195037093,3.1429410195037093

The entire annulment process for years consisted of a wink, a nod and a fat sum of money to nullify a union that, in truth, HAD been a real marriage until it was broken down by one or both parties.  It became normative to claim ""not a REAL marriage to begin with"" and bureaucracy was eased, but the wink and nod remained. Many confessors and pastors have similarly winked and nodded for divorced/remarried couples in the spirit of mercy, understanding and often the existence of a new family setting.  This isn't new, it is merely out in the open and subject to more ""official"" discernment.  In the end, the couple alone will stand before the all-merciful, all-loving God, Who likely winks and nods at the RCC's pride, hubris and Law-bound cruelty.",0,-3.141784887855268,3.141784887855268

THEY believed that it was their mission from Christ to reach as many as possible to save them from the ""last days.""  It was ONLY after the persecutions---that the groups of Christians all around the Middle East and the Mediterranean, and their elected [cheirotonesate] leaders, called 'episkopoi' or bishops, realized that maybe the world wasn't ending 'right away'.  They did gather in local little groups to discuss issues, but it wasn't until after the Treaty of Milan in 311, that they began to see themselves a large gathering called an 'ekklesia'.  That was when the church began.

The radical lesson of Natural Law is that life evolves according to internal cosmic dynamics controlling wave/ particle inter-phasing, biological evolution and the evolution of consciousness.
Fixating faith consciousness in presumed old-time understandings of static nature, flies in the face of Natural Law. 'Cosmic Religion's First Lessons' still control with respect to understanding 'Primary Scripture' and Natural Law. Evolving consciousness compels openness to the transforming powers of the laws of nature.
It is morally wrong for humans to twist laws of nature to serve human advantage in a way that is destructive of the survival laws of nature. If excess human population taxes ecological nature to death, humankind has to rethink its take on Natural Law.

Negotiate – Always ask for far more than you're prepared to settle at. 
Divide the electorate – When possible polarize Americans, pitt neighbors against each other.  It stokes anger and fear which is fuel for Trump.   
Attack the opposition on multiple fronts – There are so many Executive Orders to address.   Democrats appear to be shell-shocked.   
Exhaust the opposition – This a tactic in tennis, force your opponent to chase the ball.  Don’t give them a chance to lead.  
Numb the electorate – at some point fatigue will set in.  Fewer people will demonstrate.  They will read fewer articles.  They will disconnect and stop caring,

To me, separation of church and state means that the government cannot tell me or the church I attend what we may believe, who we may share our beliefs with or how we may conduct our lives as touching those beliefs.

It also means that I can exercise my beliefs in the voting booth (as I do in all areas of my life), but I cannot use the coercive power of government to force you to believe what I believe or live like I choose to live.

Third, you cannot use the force of government to require me to live as you think I should when what you desire is in violation of my beliefs.

So, naturally, when I vote, I try to vote for candidates who see separation of church and state in the same way I do ... which is what is recognized in the Constitution of both the US and Alaska.
