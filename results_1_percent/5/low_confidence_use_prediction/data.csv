I am a scientist myself and I don't oppose that. But what is getting missed in this discussion is that this is not a debate about the science of foetuses and abortion. It is a discussion about the intrinsic VALUE of a human person, and the position of the church should be clear that the question of the VALUE of human life is not only a MORAL debate, but it has a spiritual dimension also.  If we were simply talking about moral values, then Nigel Biggar would probably be correct. But we are not only talking about human morals.

But it was not settled. Pope Innocent had died in March 417 and the new pope, Zosimus, proceeded to reopen the case, and to make noises favorable to Pelagius. It was eventually the emperor Honorius who condemned Pelagius, and Zosimus followed the emperor's lead and condemned Pelagius in the summer of 418.

However, Zosimus himself died in late 418 and Pelegius tried to reopen the case again. This time Augustine used lay contacts (and a hefty bribe) at the imperial court to come down against Pelagius.

Catholicism has not always been very good at living with such tensions. Anglicans have historically been much better at this since the whole concept of the ""via media"" is embedded in their DNA and has been since their inception. Those four cardinals who signed the now-infamous ""dubia"" would rather exercise total control and impose their worldview on everyone else rather than live with such tension, a process that can sometimes be messy.

The telescope was immediately shut down and emergency clean up procedures went into action. The spill did more damage to the telescope itself than anything else. The mercury never even escaped the facility. Since then all the telescopes have taken extra measures so as not to have a repeat of this, and used this as a learning experience.

To me, separation of church and state means that the government cannot tell me or the church I attend what we may believe, who we may share our beliefs with or how we may conduct our lives as touching those beliefs.

The Church puts almost all of its efforts into holding marches and influencing legislators, but not where it can actually carry out the Gospel message.  When I worked for Catholic Charities, we had a program that provided, among other things, financial support of different kinds to pregnant, unmarried women.  Their social conditions would compel them to look to abortion as a solution - but we provided an incentive for an alternate one.  We spent a lot of time in trying to raise money from local parishes, and also asked the diocese for the basic funding of the service.

The radical lesson of Natural Law is that life evolves according to internal cosmic dynamics controlling wave/ particle inter-phasing, biological evolution and the evolution of consciousness.
Fixating faith consciousness in presumed old-time understandings of static nature, flies in the face of Natural Law. 'Cosmic Religion's First Lessons' still control with respect to understanding 'Primary Scripture' and Natural Law. Evolving consciousness compels openness to the transforming powers of the laws of nature.
It is morally wrong for humans to twist laws of nature to serve human advantage in a way that is destructive of the survival laws of nature. If excess human population taxes ecological nature to death, humankind has to rethink its take on Natural Law.

He posits this as though it occurred in an historical vacuum, which it did not. Reaction against the consistent ethic of life occurred against the backdrop of attempts by the Catholic left to respond to Roe, & resulted in an attempt to co-opt elements of Catholic social teaching for alignment with another political party.

It was ONLY after the persecutions---that the groups of Christians all around the Middle East and the Mediterranean, and their elected [cheirotonesate] leaders, called 'episkopoi' or bishops, realized that maybe the world wasn't ending 'right away'.  They did gather in local little groups to discuss issues, but it wasn't until after the Treaty of Milan in 311, that they began to see themselves a large gathering called an 'ekklesia'.

You are wrong on both counts.

What Alliance claimed was that what matters is whether nature has a greater influence or whether nurture has a greater influence.

What I pointed out was that no, the controversial matter would remain EVEN IF nature and nurture were each contributing identically, at 50% each.

And that controversial matter is whether or not a workplace or field should be eyed with concern if it has failed to bring on board ""enough"" women or not.

That is the eye of concern that fundamentally underlies the narrative hitting the newspapers and TVs in recent days. It is that narrative that drives so many pundits to point fingers and proclaim ""Look, there is why women face challenges in this field, it is because men in the field think women are fragile and delicate and not fit for this work"".",1,0.7677807206549421,0.7677807206549421

1993,"Vatican II qualified Church doctrines, it did not contradict them. The principles of the Church's teachings before and after the Council remained the same. 

Doctrine of a social or political nature does not follow the same course of development as pure dogma. It emerges with a certain irregularity according to the vicissitudes of history. Pope John Paul II explained that the social teaching of the Magisterium is under continual revision insofar as the unchanging principles of the gospel need to be upheld in varying social situations.

""...doctrinal, moral or pastoral issues need to be settled by interventions of the magisterium. Unity of teaching and practice is certainly necessary in the Church, ...""

I warm much more to the start of this second sentence when it comes to things mentioned specifically by Christ in the Gospel.

""...Unity of teaching and practice is certainly necessary in the Church, but this does not preclude various ways of interpreting some aspects of that teaching or drawing certain consequences from it. ""

I mention this in no small part because as she notes, we're ""due"" for another such period.

2290,"This past summer I was in a discussion about whether God changes. We discovered Aquinas handles it in a very interesting way.

God does not change in the way we change. We actualizze our potential to be on the other side of the room by moving to the other side of the room. God is everywhere, so God is on the other side of the room not by actualizing a potential, but by being on the other side of the room.

To generalize that, Aquinas says the God is pure act, with no potential to be anything else. When we act, we change: when God acts, God acts. We see God act and conclude God changes. God is not unchanging in the way a rock is unchanging, unmoving, still. God is always acting, it is the divine nature.

Only those patients who require a high-security, locked ward placement should be in the locked-ward facilities.  The ""least restrictive appropriate treatment placement"" model seeks to support the placement which best serves patients and, yes, you and I agree, part of that service is for the patient to be as close to supportive relatives and friends as possible.  Indeed, those patients from other communities do deserve to be helped in the communities where they live.  Closure of the JC Hospital and a re-directing of part of that 34.5 million toward community-based facilities would accomplish jus that.  Regards, Gary Crum",1,0.15955098422222358,0.15955098422222358

Take the Eucharist. For 1500+ years it was explained in terms of pre-Christian religious ritual, like sacrifice and altars. The final stage in a sacrifice is the sharing of the victim to enable a distribution of the numinous among the believers.
The same ritual can be reinterpreted from a different perspective. Instead of the sacrifice as explanatory key, the meal can be understood as Christ's purpose. Christ died so that we can share in his life. The concluding communal meal is a more effective key today than the rarely experienced ritual sacrifice, in a Church based on communion.
One event, understood in two ways, can easily become two different ways of experiencing a common practice. I guess i could have just said Extraordinary and ordinary forms coexist.",0,-0.01862007596012294,0.01862007596012294
