Obama has so many unknown's, negatives, lies, lack of accomplishments of any sort, that it is stunning. He goes down as the worst pResident in history for what he has done to this country.  Trump has already done more good things that are needed than obama did in 8 long, parasitic years in office.  He never had a job his entire life.  B.S. Obama was absent most of his brief time in the Senate.  He has shown no works of any sort, anywhere.  His background is so sketchy it has to be made up.  Obama is the biggest fraudster and liar in history.  How's your rates on obamacare doing?  You can keep your doctor?  lol!!  Benghazi??

So who really started this (maybe the CIA) and it is for a reason, attaching a police station just does not start a genocide. In Bahram, the Shia did not even attack anybody, they just marched in the streets and the next thing the Saudi Jeeps were in, protesters shot and the rounded up and put in Jail.

And then hypocritically ranting ad nauseum about their superiority over the Right because they don't sow division between classes.

He knew the plan was fishy, and violate Yemen sovereignty. But Trump was gun-ho and he wanted to be 'terrorist killer'.
