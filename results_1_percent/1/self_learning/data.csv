That group tends to see the Gospels as being wonderfully fluid and as meaningful now, in what Jesus tells us, as it was when written the first time.

In this regard, I find the various studies that seek to streamline church operations, that tend to focus on how to reduce overhead at the local conference level, to be missing the mark.

We noticed that once the kids hit high school their oxygen uptakes dramatically decreased. 
So what I'm saying is that if we influence children with regular exercise when their young, then their natural drop off will be less when they hit puberty. 
Picard is right. Kids are meant to move constantly. A 15 minute run/ brisk walk is a start. Not a solution. Everything fitness related starts at home very early. Parents can be a solution .

What I mean by that is,  once something is defended/supported/emphasized in an encyclical by one pope, a successor, or even a few successors down the road are not going to put other doctrines, including the one on INFALLIBILITY in jeopardy of being changed.

That was the real reason that Humanae Vitae was written [even though a majority of the committee discussing birth control approved it].  Casti connubii was written by Pius XI condemning birth control [1930's] during the height of the Great Depression---when families could barely keep body and soul together.

My understanding is that only a very small percentage of abortions affect late-term pregnancies, and also that the option of abortion is chosen at this point usually only on account of dire medical considerations, and usually against the original expectation of the woman to bring her pregnancy to term and give birth.

Also, with mid-term and late-term pregnancies, my understanding is that more women do indeed then begin to appreciate the reality of the human-beingness (word?) of the fetus they are bearing, and so perhaps also the separate interests of that being.

Indeed, divorce for a woman was a a sure indicator of a future of destitution.  In US catholic literature on marriage in those days, especially written for pastors, there was no, 'if he hits you, then leave'. More like: 'if he hits you, then try harder to love him and be a good wife.'

Dear Friends:

I ask that you please consider three points (posted separately because of word limits):

First, I can understand the Christian position that, because humans are morally more valuable than nonhumans, it is morally acceptable and, perhaps, even morally obligatory, to prefer humans over nonhumans in situations of real compulsion or necessity.  What I do *not* understand is why Christians think that God says it's morally permissible to impose suffering and death when the only values being served are palate pleasure, fashion sense, or entertainment.  It is certainly not necessary to eat animal foods for health. Indeed, most government health agencies and professional groups acknowledge that a vegan diet can be perfectly healthy for humans--and many claim that a vegan diet is actually more healthy than a diet that includes animal foods.  And there can be no justification of the use of animals for entertainment.

My point is that a car really isn't necessary to travel such short distances. Transportation isn't the barrier.

In those books we they the prayers invoking the Holy Spirit to ordain men and the parallel prayer invoking the Holy Spirit to ordain women. The language is essentially identical as as expression of intent.

More importantly is the rubrics. In Byzantine practice, for cheirotonia (major orders--deacons, priests and bishops), the laying on of hands while invoking the Holy Spirit is uniquely performed behind the iconostasis, where as with cheirothesia (minor orders) the laying on of hands is performed in front of the iconostasis. That is proof positive that despite the fact women and male deacons had different functions, and were always listed after male deacons in honour lists, they were equally recipients of the sacrament of Holy Orders. 

Evidence of women deacons in the West is, according to Gary Macy, evidenced as late as the 12th century, but, to the best of my knowledge the essential proof of the status of their ordination as a Major Order is Byzantine alone.",0,-2.7441473676885373,2.7441473676885373

Authors Foster and Kimport highlight the characteristics of women seeking abortion at or after 20 weeks gestation.
