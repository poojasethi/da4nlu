That group tends to see the Gospels as being wonderfully fluid and as meaningful now, in what Jesus tells us, as it was when written the first time.

In this regard, I find the various studies that seek to streamline church operations, that tend to focus on how to reduce overhead at the local conference level, to be missing the mark.

We noticed that once the kids hit high school their oxygen uptakes dramatically decreased. 
So what I'm saying is that if we influence children with regular exercise when their young, then their natural drop off will be less when they hit puberty. 
Picard is right. Kids are meant to move constantly. A 15 minute run/ brisk walk is a start. Not a solution. Everything fitness related starts at home very early. Parents can be a solution .

What I mean by that is,  once something is defended/supported/emphasized in an encyclical by one pope, a successor, or even a few successors down the road are not going to put other doctrines, including the one on INFALLIBILITY in jeopardy of being changed.

That was the real reason that Humanae Vitae was written [even though a majority of the committee discussing birth control approved it].  Casti connubii was written by Pius XI condemning birth control [1930's] during the height of the Great Depression---when families could barely keep body and soul together.

But I never painted all immigrants with any brush just cited one glaring example, but you sure painted me with one, didn't you?!   And I will tell you, he is a nice enough guy. But if I were to speak about anyone like he does about Jews, I would be called Cross-Burning-Hitler-Worshipping-Neo-Con....wouldn't I?

2. I said is we give away Citizenship away to people who do not deserve it.  Do you deserve to be granted citizenship when you can't identify your country's borders??  I think not.

3. We just had millions of pissed off women marching because they think their rights are trampled....yet we are importing women who are told who they are going to marry?  Does that belong in Canada?",0,0.020114071645981113,0.020114071645981113

The thought or belief in that case is that the laws of Canada should change in order to allow adults to have sex with children. Should expressions of those thoughts grew loud and frequent- just as expressions of hatred against Muslims have become loud and frequent- then it would be perfectly reasonable for the government to rebut or even condemn it. In fact, the public would demand it.

Some of it is legitimate, e.g. child abuse by clergy, no one can condone that and the Church most certainly doesn't.

However, I feel that you and others are using the 'scandal' committed by a relatively tiny minority of clergy to 'beat' the Catholic Church into the shape you desire; kick it when it is down.
I can't comment upon your brother's situation but in my experience Catholics who are homosexual presumably know the Church's teaching re: homosexuality. Those who keep a low profile are unlikely to suffer any discrimination. Those who parade it will undoubtably find themselves in trouble.

No, cats only spread Toxoplasma in their feces for a few weeks following infection with the parasite.
