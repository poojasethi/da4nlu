32,"First let me say it is very generous of you to offer your services to rid your community of pesky bears and I like that you want to ""preserve the animals"" too.
How will culling bears by use of bear hounds and tranquilizers work ?
 I have seen bears tear apart dogs that attacked their cubs. I am familiar with ""bear hounds"" as there use to be a breeder on Prince of Wales Island. I think I know which dogs you refer to.
Dispatching the males and relocating the females ? How exactly would this work ? Shooting the males is what you mean by ""dispatching"", Is that correct ? 
How can this be accomplished in a urban area without endangering people ? 
Let me say, no matter how far away you ""relocate"" black bears they have a tendency to return. Years ago, before we sent our garbage South, we had black bears all over the landfill. Tried relocation to other islands but they swam back. Just yesterday a man here took photos of a large male bear swimming across Tongass Narrows to Herring Cove.

33,"Bizarre isn't it - not only is it all Trump all the time - it's all presented as left wing spin against a candidate that most all that will read it are not actually able to vote on.

Sadly this preoccupation leaves real news that affects Canadians often ignored. I am currently reviewing the restorecsa website and buried in it are some frightening allegations at CSA and all I can think is - why is none of this being covered by the news media? Why are these organizations allowed to charge extortion rates and file copyright claims for codes that once becoming law are supposed to be public domain? That would be real Canadian news but we don't get that anymore it's all trump trump trump...

19,"I didn't vote.  I've also spent more than my share of time with Trump voters who cite incredible statements about blacks and natives.  Tonight I listened to one of my own staff go on about 'black mothers with six children screaming to keep her food stamps'.  I then explained that food stamps were part and parcel of agricultural subsidies and that in our state those subsidies to mega farmers and ranchers dwarfed our food stamp budget. ""I didn't know that"" was the response.  Now that staff member does.

41,"Non sequitur. The fact that ""functional slavery"" (one could characterise forcing prisoners to make license plates as ""functional slavery"") exists elsewhere takes nothing away from Trump's failure to denounce Nazis and white supremists and is not the fault of Trump's detractors. No one is suggesting that the legacy of slavery from the south eastern US is Trump's fault but to suggest that it was not the fault of whites is preposterous.",0,-6.235984488482469,6.235984488482469

31,"Her lies about the emails were all made on camera - directly to us.  Virtually everything she has said has been contradicted by the FBI Director - also on camera.

She was not investigated for lying to Congress - although those lies were also on camera and have also been contradicted by the FBI.

Her horrible handling of classified documents would jail an Army Lieutenant.  Having been one of those who had such a security clearance - and knows something of the laws involved - she is completely unacceptable.  I've seen enlisted men court-marshaled, jailed and given a dishonorable discharge merely for possessing and using marijuana - off duty, with no mishandling of documents - while filling an assignment dealing with top secret information.

This candidate, through her long life in politics, has proven, repeatedly and without doubt, to be untrustworthy.  

The only reason she is not behind by 20 points is because she is running against her current opponent.  Joe Biden would be up 30.",0,-5.750980236271344,5.750980236271344

40,"Yes, it as a bad decision politically.  Not only would Trudeau never set up a confidential hotline to facilitate the apprehension of radical Muslims and others performing barbaric practices such as honour killings, wife beatings and female genital mutilation, he even objected to calling such practices `barbaric`  

After all, in Trudeau Juniors` rose coloured glasses view, every culture and cultural practice is equal to every other culture and cultural practice and therefore none can be called barbaric.

This is even more the case in that Trudeau has claimed Canada to be the world`s first post national state with no basic identity, culture and values.   

In any event, it takes a subterranean IQ to equate setting up a snitch line to rigging the  electoral system and parliament so as to protect Trudeau from making a fool of himself and to ensure the Liberals get to enjoy perpetual power and the opposition to be seen but not heard.,",0,-1.7183940246114933,1.7183940246114933
