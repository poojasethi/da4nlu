23,"According to a January report from the U.S. intelligence community, the highest levels of the Russian government were involved in directing electoral interference to boost Trump at the expense of Mrs. Clinton.

Russiaâ€™s tactics included efforts to hack state election systems; infiltrating and leaking information from party committees and political strategists; and disseminating through social media and other outlets negative stories about Mrs. Clinton and positive ones about the Mr. Trump, the report said.",0,-12.606149128918368,12.606149128918368

39,">more gender equality 
And now you're REALLY just making crap up. The most gender equal society that ever existed was on the other side of the Iron Curtain prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall. 
The average 20-year old woman in what used to be East Germany today has had less than 1% of the number of orgasms her mother had at the same age, and reports about 20% of the level of her mother's satisfaction with her sex life. Which is a perhaps the single most accurate proxy there is for women's liberation. A satisfying sex life for women only exists when they are TRULY equals in society. Devoid of gender discrimination, and automatically deemed equals at work, their stress levels were lower, their relationships held on their own terms - and thus their satisfaction levels much higher. 
Polish studies on women's sexuality found similar outcomes.

The most sexually satisfied women today are in Iceland, the most gender equal society today - and perhaps the most socialist country in Europe.",0,-11.648834303382802,11.648834303382802

In my previous response (that of course no liberal could comprehend and DP blocked) I made the point that MLK, Thurgood Marshall, E.W. DuBois, etc. will be viewed as racists and bigots in the not-so-distant future. Of course, we all sit in judgement decades or a century later and smugly disparage all historic figures as racists and bigots. They don't own up to incredibly moral standards. Therefore, we're now revising history because all of these ""mythical"" figures are now being censored. That's what liberals accept.

43,"No, I'm not homophobic. It's not the boggeyman stories. I'm upset at the irresponsible transgenders. I was informed of a lawsuit against a school district that allowed a transgender girl into the girls' locker room without any other student knowing about the transgender. The real girls, excuse my wording, quickly learned who the transgender was since he was asking the girls what it is like to have female gender parts and in an aggressive, offensive manner. The girls quickly got upset and knew the transgender was still a boy. Girls told their parents, school said little in return, lawsuit filed. Supposedly the school did not legally have to tell anyone about the transgender student but make every accommodation available (thanks, Obama). Is letting the transgender say those things a violation of the school's anti-bully policy? Or does this mean transgenders will still get protection, no matter what they do?",0,-8.873226279004696,8.873226279004696
25,"@Dave Martin... you should know better! Hemp has almost no THC, and is most definitely not smoked by hipsters on restaurant balconies. Stop trying to sensationalize, it dilutes your article and has me questioning your motives and accuracy of your article, instead of me agreeing with your position. Stick to the facts next time. 
And large scale agriculture of hemp is not within the grasp of subsistence farmers, I'm afraid. Small scale dagga production for medicinal and recreational use, absolutely, but there is no capital, ownership or skills to implement large scale agriculture in the areas you mention.
If these communities, are capable of commercial farming, why are they not commercially farming other cash crops already? I can assure you that one newly legalized crop wont change the underlying issues.
I would think that high quality dagga for the export recreational market would make more sense, low scale production of a high quality product - niche dagga products with their own brand",0,-8.84898399668176,8.84898399668176
