26,"When a prominent evangelical, Tony Perkins, the head of the rabidly anti-gay Family Research Council, said that Hurricane Joaquin was “a sign of God’s wrath”, punishment for abortion and for the legalization of same-sex marriage, were conservatives outraged? Of course not.

When Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson blamed abortionists for 9/11, were conservatives outraged? Of course not.

42,"Anyone believing the majority of this type of behavior isn't the direct result of the left's race baiting politics over the past 8 years is delusional.  

When issues of police violating INDIVIDUAL rights exploded in lame stream media, it was framed in context of race (despite the fact more whites were killed by police)...an issue the entire country could have worked on TOGETHER.  That issue was hijacked.  The party of race-baiting/victimhood (democrats) and their apparatus of prestitutes succeeded in a narrative (racist police wantonly killing) having little to do with reality.  

Keeping a country divided along racial/religious/ethnic lines is the Bolshevist game plan.  It helps destroy a middle class, divert attention away from the fact we have it better than anyone else on the planet.  Globalists don't want you to catch wind of the fact our socioeconomic system (despite some flaws) has done more to move civilization forward, in shorter amount of time, than anything before or since.",1,4.617129873757584,4.617129873757584

41,"It is inevitable that white people will come to Zille's defense. If white people had to accept that all aspects of colonialism was negative,  then obviously they are included, because in the end all of them, including many of the journalists attacking her, are part of the legacy of colonialism. If the DA under Maimane agrees with the view that colonialism had no positive legacy, where does that leave white voters in terms of the DA. They will have a choice to accept that their existence in itself is part of this negative legacy and remain in the DA or leave both the DA and the country. If you accept the doctrine, you have to abide by it, do't you? Or they can refuse to accept it and vote for a party with different views. Can the DA live with a stronger grouping to its right? Will it be able to move far enough towards the ANC to attract enough votes to govern, with a grouping to the right? It will need the white voters, for now.

16,"""I am terrified of this man running America. It is the worst example of behaviour for your kids to see."" 
Did your kids happen to see the absolute foul and disgusting words of Madonna and Ashely Judd who were so prominent at the faux march? The hypocrisy is remarkable. I have conversed with a number of women who are more than thankful that they were not secretly recorded (as Trump was) when they have been on ""girls night out"" adventures or at bachelorette parties. Many women looked past the recording knowing that what he actually said on tape was ""when you are a star, they LET you......"" You know, the same LET that happens when you pursue intimacy with your partner. The false narrative that was allowed to permeate the MSM that he advocated assault is part of the effort to destroy him. What he said was not something I would want my kids to hear...nor are things many of us have said in settings that we thought were private. It was the left wing media that chose to have my kids hear it.",0,-1.962597592477204,1.962597592477204

33,"This list is telling of Walker.  Pandering to legislators for projects that either make no economic sense or should be done by private sector.  The only one that makes sense is upgrades to the Port of Anchorage.  Money to the Bush is a black hole, we need to smarten up and stop doing that.  The Bush is dying and moving to the road system.  The gasline that makes no economic sense is his pet fantasy project, that makes no economic sense.  Roads on the NS should be built by the oil industry or the NSB.  And the fact that he proposes throwing more millions at the Port Mac Rail Extension boondoggle of the MSB's ... shows us that he has no soul.  He has no problem wasting millions of other peoples' money on pointless spending to buy legislative allegiance to help foster his pet projects.

Her criticism of Trudeau for denouncing the FoxNews Flase Flag is disloyal both to truth and to Canada.
