34,"Lets be clear, oldgit.  Any temporary and/or limited suspension of collective bargaining  and the right to strike was applicable only to designated federal public sector units/groups and for specific circumstances.

I agree with FDR's letter to the US federal employees association in 1935 or 36 explaining collective bargaining and the right to strike were not applicable to public employees who would be striking against their employers the American people.  He further noted market disciplines served to ensure collective bargaining demands in the private sector were reasonable but no such disciplines would exist in public sector bargaining.  

The right to strike in the public sector is not a right, it is a legislated privilege.  In 1967, a weak Liberal government in a moment caved to the public sector unions and the NDP and granted this privilege.

We have been paying an exorbitant price ever since!!! 

I wish Harper had indeed taken away the right to strike from federal employees!",0,-17.512421726220765,17.512421726220765

23,"The solution to this is quite simple. The government needs to clearly stipulate the requirements airlines must follow during such delays. Something similar to the following: 1) In the event of a delay exceeding 1 hour, the plane must disembark; 2) water and washroom facilities must be available at all times during a delay or disembark must occur; 3) a failure of climate controls or similar comfort systems during a delay must result in immediate disembarking of the plane; 4) any significant health concerns must be immediately addressed during a delay leading to disembarking the plane if necessary; 5) the safety of animals below during delays must also be assured; 6) the safety and overall welfare of the passengers must be the highest priority during delays and stiff penalties will result where this is proven not to be the case; 7) passengers will receive compensation when delays are found to be the fault of the airline.",0,-9.732051004236714,9.732051004236714

The only one that makes sense is upgrades to the Port of Anchorage.  Money to the Bush is a black hole, we need to smarten up and stop doing that.  The Bush is dying and moving to the road system.  The gasline that makes no economic sense is his pet fantasy project, that makes no economic sense.  Roads on the NS should be built by the oil industry or the NSB.  And the fact that he proposes throwing more millions at the Port Mac Rail Extension boondoggle of the MSB's ... shows us that he has no soul.
