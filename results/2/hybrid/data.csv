26,"Such a beautiful aircraft unfortunately the Euro-fighter flies faster and turns  tighter like an air superiority fighter is supposed to. The Russian Yak now being fielded is faster, turns tighter and can do a a 360 in three wing spans, the Chinese stole the F-35 plans and made it faster than ours. So what is this dog going to do to enhance our safety? They also plan on building more F-22's as it has better dynamics than the multi-role F-35 series. We need new generals in all the services.",0,-14.816338773492046,14.816338773492046

6,"Blind to the past when we lack a forensic audit, despite clear warning flags. Blind to the future because: (1) we lack the detailed spreadsheet projections the mayor has and will not release because it's 'pre-decisional' - if that is even a word - along with other materials similarly classified; (2) we have no detailed disclosure of O&M costs along with related ridership fare recovery revenues; (3) we have no clear idea of the costs to complete due to huge past discrepancies and multiple guess terminus sites; (4) unclear FFG status; (5) conflicting budgetary demands and constrained revenue resources in the state and city requiring finding new revenue sources; and (6) what numbers were included in the recent presentation to the legislature were inadequate (at least to me - and I used to do those kinds of presentations asking for funding). If I was a decision maker, I'd say no funding until more clarity is created. So am having difficulty seeing how GET is the best funding choice.",0,-13.501876216942716,13.501876216942716
38,"It is possible that Z could be a good priest for a particular type of Catholic, but not for most Catholics.  Most Catholics are not orthodox.  In this country most believe contraceptives are just fine, LGBTQi people should be able to marry, women priests would be fine, Mass every so often rather than weekly is fine, going to confession is really only necessary occasionally.  People don't practice the faith in an orthodox way but that doesn't mean they have lost faith in Jesus.  They just don't think all the practices are necessary.  

Create a priesthood of the orthodox and you will have the smaller, purer Church of BXVI's dreams.   It just won't be fulfilling the commission that Jesus gave to the disciples and apostles.",0,-13.466646937802224,13.466646937802224

24,"Then Martin should dip into Canada Steamship Lines and make the payout being he took advantage of the loophole he left himself so he could flag his ships in the Bahamas and not pay its fair share of Canadian taxes and follow Canadian labor codes.

Paul Martin and CSL haven't paid their fair share of taxes since the Chretien yeas.

Can a troubled black family go to a Black Life Matter building in its own community for support (not talking about a rally) ? What positive changes are they making in their black communities on a day to day basis ? We seem to hear of them only when a white person takes a life of a black person for racial intentions.

43,"No, I'm not homophobic. It's not the boggeyman stories. I'm upset at the irresponsible transgenders. I was informed of a lawsuit against a school district that allowed a transgender girl into the girls' locker room without any other student knowing about the transgender. The real girls, excuse my wording, quickly learned who the transgender was since he was asking the girls what it is like to have female gender parts and in an aggressive, offensive manner. The girls quickly got upset and knew the transgender was still a boy. Girls told their parents, school said little in return, lawsuit filed. Supposedly the school did not legally have to tell anyone about the transgender student but make every accommodation available (thanks, Obama). Is letting the transgender say those things a violation of the school's anti-bully policy? Or does this mean transgenders will still get protection, no matter what they do?",0,-2.3823621832561637,2.3823621832561637
30,"Every history is a period of depravity and immorality. You delude yourself with such a hypocritical, insular, and disjointed view of the world.  In my previous response (that of course no liberal could comprehend and DP blocked) I made the point that MLK, Thurgood Marshall, E.W. DuBois, etc. will be viewed as racists and bigots in the not-so-distant future. Of course, we all sit in judgement decades or a century later and smugly disparage all historic figures as racists and bigots. They don't own up to incredibly moral standards. Therefore, we're now revising history because all of these ""mythical"" figures are now being censored. That's what liberals accept.
