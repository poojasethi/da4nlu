6,"So just answer the questions I gave you, and then we can part.

How sincere is ""compassion""...what acts of compassion for these ""fellow Christians"" have actually been done..prayer, fasting, money, material aid, even direct friendship?

How many of these ""fellow Christians"" do you personally know?

Let's just ""test"" for actual compassion?",0,-16.833107031814865,16.833107031814865

30,"Do you honestly the comments here conductive of this, perhaps I am too thick to understand subtleties of discourse, but it looks more like mockery. 

Some people express their spirituality through a multitude of ways, some believe in miracles some don't. Like the Eucharistic miracles, or the Holy Fire in the sepulchre of our Lord, these I have difficulty believing in, and personally I see them as tricks to gain pilgrims, but I'd never mock a genuine soul trying to love God through believe in those miracles. 

We will never all the truth of this world in this life, we can only have faith and hope for the blank spaces that where tiny amount of reason we have can adequately formulate. 

Seeking truth is good, but coupled with lack of respect seems venomous in itself.  

God created the universe, if he wills it he can allow for miracles. I'd rather be a fool for Christ than uncharitable.",0,-12.21968105268174,12.21968105268174
18,"That's merely your opinion, which is based on a shallow understanding of the whole matter of what it means to live a fully Christian life. 

I pointed out that had the Christians lived their Christianity to the full, including living a generous family life (including their fecundity), they wouldn't be a minority...the whole land would be Christian.

And not simply because of the demographic advantage of large families.

Living Christianity to the fullest means living a very holy and generous life...it's attractive, it draws others in, it leads to deeper conversation and friendship among lukewarm Christians and non-Christians.  

These friendships lead...over 50 or so years to natural conversions, as it did in the early Church.

You should stop the attack and think more deeply about the matter, as I have presented it.

You miss the whole action of grace and the Holy Spirit, and so your comments ring hollow and shallow.  You don't understand the sense and value of Christian family lfe.",0,-10.98683609350445,10.98683609350445

Nor is any human being perfect. He expressed her public decor is ""Miss Piggy"" - so what? Men perceive women as the opposite sex, just as women perceive men differently. Some men prefer plump women just like some women prefer short men. Why? I don't have a clue why! God only knows why people choose the people they do for mates or what is or isn't attractive. These perfectionists are expecting too much. 

It reminds me of high school when at 16 I asked this gorgeous blond out on a date. On the way to a movie, she told me she was happy that I'd asked her out, because all of her dates took her home before she ever got to an event. I asked why? Abruptly, she pulled out her false teeth and started telling me it's because she has no teeth. The next corner, I turned my car around and took her home.",1,0.9461301781626403,0.9461301781626403
