Sorry, not to sound mean, but I would have assumed with all of the technology and how much money is spent on each aircraft, they would have GPS on them so military can track their positions at all times, even when powered off and in the ocean. I mean, we have GPS on the bus. i can pull up an app and tell you exactly where a bus is, even if it is parked in the yard after hours at 3 am.",0,-16.33702468402815,16.33702468402815

Per your commentary on ND's requiring further oversight: I agree. However, let's first begin with MD's; and their overbilling or maybe their obfuscated impropriety with pharmaceuticals? 

Perhaps we should start to with increased transparency with the ratio of opioids and benzodiazepines prescriptions dolled out per MD that are ruining lives and costing tax payers?

Last time I checked ND's weren't killing people.

34,"Are you unfamiliar with how St Thomas worked through those points, and so beautifully he did so?

I expected at least a base line familiarity with a doctor of the Church.

Can't help you.   Aquinas laid it all out but it requires a bit of sweat to get through it.

Bottom line:  nothing can be the effect of an infinite causal chain.

But Aquinas presents other ""ways"" to come to a knowledge of God.

You seem to misunderstand the relationship between the NDP and the Greens.  They don't ask each other for anything.  The NDP are NDP and the Greens are Green.  The only agreement that they have is confidence motions, nothing else.  As an example, they disagree on LNG; Horgan supports it and Weaver does not.  Disagreement will not get in the way.

41,"Non sequitur. The fact that ""functional slavery"" (one could characterise forcing prisoners to make license plates as ""functional slavery"") exists elsewhere takes nothing away from Trump's failure to denounce Nazis and white supremists and is not the fault of Trump's detractors. No one is suggesting that the legacy of slavery from the south eastern US is Trump's fault but to suggest that it was not the fault of whites is preposterous.",0,-6.645818098629929,6.645818098629929
31,"Her lies about the emails were all made on camera - directly to us.  Virtually everything she has said has been contradicted by the FBI Director - also on camera.

She was not investigated for lying to Congress - although those lies were also on camera and have also been contradicted by the FBI.

Her horrible handling of classified documents would jail an Army Lieutenant.  Having been one of those who had such a security clearance - and knows something of the laws involved - she is completely unacceptable.  I've seen enlisted men court-marshaled, jailed and given a dishonorable discharge merely for possessing and using marijuana - off duty, with no mishandling of documents - while filling an assignment dealing with top secret information.

This candidate, through her long life in politics, has proven, repeatedly and without doubt, to be untrustworthy.  

The only reason she is not behind by 20 points is because she is running against her current opponent.  Joe Biden would be up 30.",0,-6.484982852101824,6.484982852101824

Not only would Trudeau never set up a confidential hotline to facilitate the apprehension of radical Muslims and others performing barbaric practices such as honour killings, wife beatings and female genital mutilation, he even objected to calling such practices `barbaric`  

After all, in Trudeau Juniors` rose coloured glasses view, every culture and cultural practice is equal to every other culture and cultural practice and therefore none can be called barbaric.

This is even more the case in that Trudeau has claimed Canada to be the world`s first post national state with no basic identity, culture and values.   

In any event, it takes a subterranean IQ to equate setting up a snitch line to rigging the  electoral system and parliament so as to protect Trudeau from making a fool of himself and to ensure the Liberals get to enjoy perpetual power and the opposition to be seen but not heard.,",0,-1.8859694248470777,1.8859694248470777
