Sorry, not to sound mean, but I would have assumed with all of the technology and how much money is spent on each aircraft, they would have GPS on them so military can track their positions at all times, even when powered off and in the ocean. I mean, we have GPS on the bus. i can pull up an app and tell you exactly where a bus is, even if it is parked in the yard after hours at 3 am.",0,-16.555478152246096,16.555478152246096

14,"Perhaps you should look unbiasedly at gene mutations and the risks associated with autism et al, but undoubtedly you will not. 

Per your commentary on ND's requiring further oversight: I agree. However, let's first begin with MD's; and their overbilling or maybe their obfuscated impropriety with pharmaceuticals? 

Perhaps we should start to with increased transparency with the ratio of opioids and benzodiazepines prescriptions dolled out per MD that are ruining lives and costing tax payers?

34,"Are you unfamiliar with how St Thomas worked through those points, and so beautifully he did so?

I expected at least a base line familiarity with a doctor of the Church.

Can't help you.   Aquinas laid it all out but it requires a bit of sweat to get through it.

Bottom line:  nothing can be the effect of an infinite causal chain.

But Aquinas presents other ""ways"" to come to a knowledge of God.

You seem to misunderstand the relationship between the NDP and the Greens.  They don't ask each other for anything.  The NDP are NDP and the Greens are Green.  The only agreement that they have is confidence motions, nothing else.  As an example, they disagree on LNG; Horgan supports it and Weaver does not.  Disagreement will not get in the way.

26,"It is not about numbers.  It is about doing what is right, for the glory of God and the good of souls.  The Anglican Communion is to be commended for doing what is right, and paying the price.  If we are not willing to pay the price, it is our problem, not theirs.  Patriarchal edicts, such as Humanae Vitae and Ordinatio Sacerdotalis, are no longer tenable.  Humanae Vitae is an unenforceable edict about a good doctrine.  Ordinatio Sacerdotalis is an enforceable edict about a bad doctrine.  As patriarchal edicts, both are pastorally disastrous even though they maintain a semblance of an ancient order of things that is passing away.  We don't need patriarchs anymore.  We need pastors, male and female.  For your consideration:

American history, from witch hunts to blacklisting to gay bashing, has been replete with  seeking out and driving out ""the other,"" ""the alien voice,"" the enemy""---in order to make us smaller and purer.
