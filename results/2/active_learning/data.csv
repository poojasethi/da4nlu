20,"""Introvert"" - yes, that was the label rolled out by the PMO to excuse Harper's disdain for the press, his disdain for taking questions, and his general cowardice in facing unscripted questions from the public.     In reality - Harper was a bully, profane, domineering in caucus, and a true narcissist who used public money to create a Hall of pictures (of himself) in a Parliamentary lobby, a 24/7 Channel dedicated to himself, and even sent out his first PM Christmas card as a picture of himself, alone, staring at a window full of pictures of himself.

Harper was no ""introvert"" - that was just a sorry excuse used to explain his behaviour after the fact.     It's actually a slap in the face to introverts to use that label for Harper.",1,-10.957317155687644,10.957317155687644
30,"Right track/wrong track polls I referred to https://today.yougov.com/news/2016/08/12/americans-are-unhappy-other-side/

Bush followed 8 years of Reagan, so it is possible. Gore came close to beating Bush so it is possible. Polling said Hillary would win. A heck of a lot of people were quite certain that hatred for Trump & his ideas as well as satisfaction with Obama policies would overcome the doubts about Hillary personally. 

Believing the country is headed in the wrong direction doesn't equate to ""the incumbent president is godawful"". That's not what I said at all. Many people liked Obama personally & he managed to always sound like the shocked & dismayed outsider when criticism was made of his administration.  

But people who liked Obama didn't like the policies, because with Hillary promising to keep things as they were, even with Obama campaigning on the same plan, Obama's policies finally got separated from his charisma, and to the dismay of the party, the policies lost.",0,-10.779809995576684,10.779809995576684

41,"It is inevitable that white people will come to Zille's defense. If white people had to accept that all aspects of colonialism was negative,  then obviously they are included, because in the end all of them, including many of the journalists attacking her, are part of the legacy of colonialism. If the DA under Maimane agrees with the view that colonialism had no positive legacy, where does that leave white voters in terms of the DA. They will have a choice to accept that their existence in itself is part of this negative legacy and remain in the DA or leave both the DA and the country. If you accept the doctrine, you have to abide by it, do't you? Or they can refuse to accept it and vote for a party with different views. Can the DA live with a stronger grouping to its right? Will it be able to move far enough towards the ANC to attract enough votes to govern, with a grouping to the right? It will need the white voters, for now.

16,"""I am terrified of this man running America. It is the worst example of behaviour for your kids to see."" 
Did your kids happen to see the absolute foul and disgusting words of Madonna and Ashely Judd who were so prominent at the faux march? The hypocrisy is remarkable. I have conversed with a number of women who are more than thankful that they were not secretly recorded (as Trump was) when they have been on ""girls night out"" adventures or at bachelorette parties. Many women looked past the recording knowing that what he actually said on tape was ""when you are a star, they LET you......"" You know, the same LET that happens when you pursue intimacy with your partner. The false narrative that was allowed to permeate the MSM that he advocated assault is part of the effort to destroy him. What he said was not something I would want my kids to hear...nor are things many of us have said in settings that we thought were private. It was the left wing media that chose to have my kids hear it.",1,-9.088793771354922,9.088793771354922

And the fact that he proposes throwing more millions at the Port Mac Rail Extension boondoggle of the MSB's ... shows us that he has no soul.

When issues of police violating INDIVIDUAL rights exploded in lame stream media, it was framed in context of race (despite the fact more whites were killed by police)...an issue the entire country could have worked on TOGETHER.  That issue was hijacked.  The party of race-baiting/victimhood (democrats) and their apparatus of prestitutes succeeded in a narrative (racist police wantonly killing) having little to do with reality.  

Keeping a country divided along racial/religious/ethnic lines is the Bolshevist game plan.  It helps destroy a middle class, divert attention away from the fact we have it better than anyone else on the planet.
