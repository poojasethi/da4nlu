42,"That the Holy See would even consider suggesting that seminarians learn about ecology and the climate change mythology of the left, demonstrates how far the Papacy has fallen under Francis.

What seminarians need to learn is how to deal with the unruly, rude, intrusive, demanding, unforgiving, hateful laity that they will find fill many of the pews in a typical parish (especially in suburban areas).  How to cope with a female parishioner who asks the parish's housekeeper to go through the trash and count up the number of wine bottles Father drank, and to look through the letters on Father's desk and report anything interesting (as one priest friend of mine experienced - this really happened!); hot to deal with theologically and liturgically ignorant parishioners who, nonetheless, feel free to comment on Father's homily or presidential style at Mass, these are among the things future priests need to know.",1,-2.7489257915711303,2.7489257915711303

Bottom line the Trump administration will have little patience with the protestor class.  The weather forecast for Cannonball next week is zero degrees Fahrenheit.  After January 20th an ill wind will begin sweeping through the area.

43,"No, I'm not homophobic. It's not the boggeyman stories. I'm upset at the irresponsible transgenders. I was informed of a lawsuit against a school district that allowed a transgender girl into the girls' locker room without any other student knowing about the transgender. The real girls, excuse my wording, quickly learned who the transgender was since he was asking the girls what it is like to have female gender parts and in an aggressive, offensive manner. The girls quickly got upset and knew the transgender was still a boy. Girls told their parents, school said little in return, lawsuit filed. Supposedly the school did not legally have to tell anyone about the transgender student but make every accommodation available (thanks, Obama). Is letting the transgender say those things a violation of the school's anti-bully policy?

30,"Every history is a period of depravity and immorality. You delude yourself with such a hypocritical, insular, and disjointed view of the world.  In my previous response (that of course no liberal could comprehend and DP blocked) I made the point that MLK, Thurgood Marshall, E.W. DuBois, etc. will be viewed as racists and bigots in the not-so-distant future. Of course, we all sit in judgement decades or a century later and smugly disparage all historic figures as racists and bigots. They don't own up to incredibly moral standards. Therefore, we're now revising history because all of these ""mythical"" figures are now being censored. That's what liberals accept.

25,"@Dave Martin... you should know better! Hemp has almost no THC, and is most definitely not smoked by hipsters on restaurant balconies. Stop trying to sensationalize, it dilutes your article and has me questioning your motives and accuracy of your article, instead of me agreeing with your position. Stick to the facts next time. 
And large scale agriculture of hemp is not within the grasp of subsistence farmers, I'm afraid. Small scale dagga production for medicinal and recreational use, absolutely, but there is no capital, ownership or skills to implement large scale agriculture in the areas you mention.
If these communities, are capable of commercial farming, why are they not commercially farming other cash crops already? I can assure you that one newly legalized crop wont change the underlying issues.
I would think that high quality dagga for the export recreational market would make more sense, low scale production of a high quality product - niche dagga products with their own brand",0,-0.26454865222398993,0.26454865222398993
