Ahhh by the same token that would also mean that it is proof that natives (in Canada) and blacks (in the US) are far more criminal than whites. That sounds pretty racist to me.
I think the explanation is more likely that women are held accountable for their actions to a lesser degree than men. It's called ""the female discount.""",1,-4.209873926429411,4.209873926429411

16,"This article is rather silly, if not stupid. She went public and he responded publicly. Freedom of speech does not have to be expressed and explicit they way politically correct idealists want. Nor is any human being perfect. He expressed her public decor is ""Miss Piggy"" - so what? Men perceive women as the opposite sex, just as women perceive men differently. Some men prefer plump women just like some women prefer short men. Why? I don't have a clue why! God only knows why people choose the people they do for mates or what is or isn't attractive. These perfectionists are expecting too much. 

It reminds me of high school when at 16 I asked this gorgeous blond out on a date. On the way to a movie, she told me she was happy that I'd asked her out, because all of her dates took her home before she ever got to an event. I asked why?
