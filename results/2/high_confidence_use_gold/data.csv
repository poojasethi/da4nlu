34,"Lets be clear, oldgit.  Any temporary and/or limited suspension of collective bargaining  and the right to strike was applicable only to designated federal public sector units/groups and for specific circumstances.

I agree with FDR's letter to the US federal employees association in 1935 or 36 explaining collective bargaining and the right to strike were not applicable to public employees who would be striking against their employers the American people.  He further noted market disciplines served to ensure collective bargaining demands in the private sector were reasonable but no such disciplines would exist in public sector bargaining.  

The right to strike in the public sector is not a right, it is a legislated privilege.  In 1967, a weak Liberal government in a moment caved to the public sector unions and the NDP and granted this privilege.

We have been paying an exorbitant price ever since!!! 

I wish Harper had indeed taken away the right to strike from federal employees!",0,-17.865392221768033,17.865392221768033

27,When you wear very overt religious clothing you are asking to be identified by your faith FIRST. That is the point of it and that is how Canadians will view Singh.

23,"The solution to this is quite simple. The government needs to clearly stipulate the requirements airlines must follow during such delays. Something similar to the following: 1) In the event of a delay exceeding 1 hour, the plane must disembark; 2) water and washroom facilities must be available at all times during a delay or disembark must occur; 3) a failure of climate controls or similar comfort systems during a delay must result in immediate disembarking of the plane; 4) any significant health concerns must be immediately addressed during a delay leading to disembarking the plane if necessary; 5) the safety of animals below during delays must also be assured; 6) the safety and overall welfare of the passengers must be the highest priority during delays and stiff penalties will result where this is proven not to be the case; 7) passengers will receive compensation when delays are found to be the fault of the airline.",0,-9.887370700242977,9.887370700242977

20,"""Introvert"" - yes, that was the label rolled out by the PMO to excuse Harper's disdain for the press, his disdain for taking questions, and his general cowardice in facing unscripted questions from the public.     In reality - Harper was a bully, profane, domineering in caucus, and a true narcissist who used public money to create a Hall of pictures (of himself) in a Parliamentary lobby, a 24/7 Channel dedicated to himself, and even sent out his first PM Christmas card as a picture of himself, alone, staring at a window full of pictures of himself.

Harper was no ""introvert"" - that was just a sorry excuse used to explain his behaviour after the fact.     It's actually a slap in the face to introverts to use that label for Harper.",1,-6.121834112534738,6.121834112534738

Bush followed 8 years of Reagan, so it is possible. Gore came close to beating Bush so it is possible. Polling said Hillary would win. A heck of a lot of people were quite certain that hatred for Trump & his ideas as well as satisfaction with Obama policies would overcome the doubts about Hillary personally. 

Believing the country is headed in the wrong direction doesn't equate to ""the incumbent president is godawful"". That's not what I said at all. Many people liked Obama personally & he managed to always sound like the shocked & dismayed outsider when criticism was made of his administration.  

But people who liked Obama didn't like the policies, because with Hillary promising to keep things as they were, even with Obama campaigning on the same plan, Obama's policies finally got separated from his charisma, and to the dismay of the party, the policies lost.",0,-5.985210441052681,5.985210441052681
