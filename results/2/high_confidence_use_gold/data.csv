26,"Such a beautiful aircraft unfortunately the Euro-fighter flies faster and turns  tighter like an air superiority fighter is supposed to. The Russian Yak now being fielded is faster, turns tighter and can do a a 360 in three wing spans, the Chinese stole the F-35 plans and made it faster than ours. So what is this dog going to do to enhance our safety? They also plan on building more F-22's as it has better dynamics than the multi-role F-35 series. We need new generals in all the services.",0,-10.485982670082002,10.485982670082002
6,"Blind to the past when we lack a forensic audit, despite clear warning flags. Blind to the future because: (1) we lack the detailed spreadsheet projections the mayor has and will not release because it's 'pre-decisional' - if that is even a word - along with other materials similarly classified; (2) we have no detailed disclosure of O&M costs along with related ridership fare recovery revenues; (3) we have no clear idea of the costs to complete due to huge past discrepancies and multiple guess terminus sites; (4) unclear FFG status; (5) conflicting budgetary demands and constrained revenue resources in the state and city requiring finding new revenue sources; and (6) what numbers were included in the recent presentation to the legislature were inadequate (at least to me - and I used to do those kinds of presentations asking for funding). If I was a decision maker, I'd say no funding until more clarity is created. So am having difficulty seeing how GET is the best funding choice.",0,-9.876865290574088,9.876865290574088
38,"It is possible that Z could be a good priest for a particular type of Catholic, but not for most Catholics.  Most Catholics are not orthodox.  In this country most believe contraceptives are just fine, LGBTQi people should be able to marry, women priests would be fine, Mass every so often rather than weekly is fine, going to confession is really only necessary occasionally.  People don't practice the faith in an orthodox way but that doesn't mean they have lost faith in Jesus.  They just don't think all the practices are necessary.  

Create a priesthood of the orthodox and you will have the smaller, purer Church of BXVI's dreams.   It just won't be fulfilling the commission that Jesus gave to the disciples and apostles.",0,-8.36950425054663,8.36950425054663
24,"Then Martin should dip into Canada Steamship Lines and make the payout being he took advantage of the loophole he left himself so he could flag his ships in the Bahamas and not pay its fair share of Canadian taxes and follow Canadian labor codes.

Paul Martin and CSL haven't paid their fair share of taxes since the Chretien yeas.

7,"With so many other candidates to choose from, why did the DNC so favor Trump that they even manipulated delegates at the convention to help him win the nomination?  With the deterioration of the campaign to a C-level soap opera, a possible answer occurs:  while conservatives brag so much about reducing the size of government, their logical first step is the elimination of their own party.",0,-6.519780358754135,6.519780358754135

32,"I hear of this group Black Live Matters, do they operate as an organization in a building that can reach out and bring about change to black families/youths in their own black communities ? Can a troubled black family go to a Black Life Matter building in its own community for support (not talking about a rally) ? What positive changes are they making in their black communities on a day to day basis ? We seem to hear of them only when a white person takes a life of a black person for racial intentions.

No wait! is born with fetal alcohol syndrome but they decide to keep the little angel. A couple of years down the road, the child dies of the injuries inflicted while it was crying. Or worse.

42,"That the Holy See would even consider suggesting that seminarians learn about ecology and the climate change mythology of the left, demonstrates how far the Papacy has fallen under Francis.

What seminarians need to learn is how to deal with the unruly, rude, intrusive, demanding, unforgiving, hateful laity that they will find fill many of the pews in a typical parish (especially in suburban areas).  How to cope with a female parishioner who asks the parish's housekeeper to go through the trash and count up the number of wine bottles Father drank, and to look through the letters on Father's desk and report anything interesting (as one priest friend of mine experienced - this really happened!); hot to deal with theologically and liturgically ignorant parishioners who, nonetheless, feel free to comment on Father's homily or presidential style at Mass, these are among the things future priests need to know.",1,-4.506441744538253,4.506441744538253
2,Oh come on!
