How sincere is ""compassion""...what acts of compassion for these ""fellow Christians"" have actually been done..prayer, fasting, money, material aid, even direct friendship?

How many of these ""fellow Christians"" do you personally know?

Let's just ""test"" for actual compassion?",0,-18.589872834731274,18.589872834731274

30,"Do you honestly the comments here conductive of this, perhaps I am too thick to understand subtleties of discourse, but it looks more like mockery. 

Some people express their spirituality through a multitude of ways, some believe in miracles some don't. Like the Eucharistic miracles, or the Holy Fire in the sepulchre of our Lord, these I have difficulty believing in, and personally I see them as tricks to gain pilgrims, but I'd never mock a genuine soul trying to love God through believe in those miracles. 

We will never all the truth of this world in this life, we can only have faith and hope for the blank spaces that where tiny amount of reason we have can adequately formulate. 

Seeking truth is good, but coupled with lack of respect seems venomous in itself.  

God created the universe, if he wills it he can allow for miracles. I'd rather be a fool for Christ than uncharitable.",0,-13.634455616133707,13.634455616133707
18,"That's merely your opinion, which is based on a shallow understanding of the whole matter of what it means to live a fully Christian life. 

I pointed out that had the Christians lived their Christianity to the full, including living a generous family life (including their fecundity), they wouldn't be a minority...the whole land would be Christian.

And not simply because of the demographic advantage of large families.

Living Christianity to the fullest means living a very holy and generous life...it's attractive, it draws others in, it leads to deeper conversation and friendship among lukewarm Christians and non-Christians.  

These friendships lead...over 50 or so years to natural conversions, as it did in the early Church.

You should stop the attack and think more deeply about the matter, as I have presented it.

You miss the whole action of grace and the Holy Spirit, and so your comments ring hollow and shallow.  You don't understand the sense and value of Christian family lfe.",0,-12.417232256144619,12.417232256144619

Pearson received a Nobel Peace prize because he diplomatically intervened to allow all opponents to desist without hurting their key national interests.Today his successors are at the head of a lynch mob trying to destroy the integrity of Syria, which is deperately fighting to defend its non-sectarian state from a Sharia regime that almost succeeded in taking power, with US help.
