32,"According to this article: WASHINGTON — Churches should have the First Amendment right to endorse political candidates and still keep their tax-free status, say House Republicans, who quietly tucked a provision into a sweeping spending bill that would deny the IRS money to enforce the 63-year-old law prohibiting such outright politicking from the pulpit.
...the measure could upend the system of campaign financing by allowing churches to use their tax-free status to funnel money to political candidates.
“All they care about is the Christian groups, and in particular, it will end up as the extreme religious right Christian groups,” Little said. “If this goes through, this would add just another way in which unregulated dark money could be used.”
If churches are donating money they are also dictating legislation. If they are dictating legislation, they become the law-makers. How is that any different that what is occurring in Iran, other than the type of religion?",0,-19.64349393052964,19.64349393052964
13,"Although he was a deist, Thomas Jefferson who first used the term ""separation between church and state,"" believed that this was to protect religion from the state rather than to protect the state from religion.

5,"Dunsmuir and Schneider write: “The Fed’s preferred measure of underlying inflation has retreated to 1.5 per cent, from 1.8 per cent earlier this year, and has run below the central bank’s 2 per cent target for more than five years.” This is false. The US Fed targets the personal consumption expenditures price index (PCEPI). It was at 2.2% in February, but has since dropped to 1.7% in April. Except for February 2017 it has only exceeded its two percent target from January to April 2012, i.e. in the month the US Fed officially adopted an inflation target rate with the PCEPI as its indicator. Dunsmuir and Schneider are referencing the PCEPI excluding food and energy (PCEPILFE), a core PCEPI measure, and the preferred one of the US Fed, although they also follow a trimmed mean core measure quite closely. It did fall from an inflation rate of 1.8% in January and February to 1.5% in April and has never been at or above the two percent target from January 2012 forward.",0,-18.98269458392045,18.98269458392045
22,"At mass I've seen old people, I've seen families.   But  I've never seen one ""Trent Horn"" like young person who discovered Catholicism in High School and was truly enthralled with it.  The odds of sighting an ardent young person at mass are like the odds of meeting a cougar on the hiking trail.

If there has ever been a popular movement of young people in the Church,  I'm unaware of it.

On the other hand, there's the protestants.   They do draw young people.   And their views on sexuality and women's rights aren't necessarily far different from Catholicism's.

Broadly speaking, what are these protestant churches doing that Catholicism isn't?   That's the fruitful question.   They are doing a lot of things that appeal to people's needs.   

The Catholic strategy seems uninterested in that, and is sticking with oldster pro Catholics babytalk on  1)   Endless catechesis (zzzz)  2)  Culture warfare with a focus on the pelvis.

Mckenna is on prozac believing her own BS that she can somehow make an emitter of 1.6% GHG total somehow this shining NEW economic light for Leftards. 
Thankfully money is also liquid and transportable. If you have any money in Canada tied to manufacturers, consider moving it to USA or other friendlier jurisdictions until this farce is over. This feels like Trudeau mess of the 1980's. Took our country 10 years to recover from that. Wait until the retired Canadians feel their investments go down the toilet.

27,"Even Pope Francis has weighed in on this, inviting National Conferences of Bishops the world over to ordain ""proven"" laypeople (married parishioners living Christian lives in their parishes). But the Bishops don't budge. Maybe they fear the Curia? It is a ""mystery."" But a ""crisis,"" that under no circumstances can be  solved???? I don't think so. If the Curia fears Francis's presence in Rome inviting bishops to take action, they would hate him absent, too, taking away from them a scapegoat, among other things. But shame on our bishops for not taking up the pope's invitation. There are certainly good laypeople out there who could be ordained.",0,-17.291015042627166,17.291015042627166

But for the man just make damn sure you don't impregnate a women until you're ready to have a child with her. Yes that applies to women too. Of course such  a law would be near impossible to enforce but so was abortion before 1973. If you want to go the legal route to protect the unborn just remember its egg & sperm. Then let's find every root cause of abortion and work to eliminate it like poverty, social pressure, dignity of women etc. But to simply think law alone works and just the female end to save the unborn is not realistic. There were more abortions in the lower east side neighborhood in my family circle before '73 then after. And now Google Trends has found 'do it yourself' abortions increasing in states with tight laws. See if I can find link. I've said enough here.",0,-10.51277929616985,10.51277929616985

41,"The scientific method is very similar to journalistic integrity- explore an event, object or condition and discover the facts, regardless of where said information may lead the investigator.  Now- media bias, especially from the 'right', front loads the conclusion- much as we see in religious institutions- the facts MUST FIT the dogma of their beliefs.  

As if that wasn't enough of a challenge, now we have the Russians taking full advantage of American bias and partisan behavior.  Our unchecked open forums allow (entice?) anyone to become a 'journalist'.  For those here who are on the R side of the aisle- just imagine how you would be acting if it 17 US intel agencies had stated that HRC's campaign had met with the Russians.
