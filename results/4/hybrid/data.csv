37,"Now we see the great worry that is behind your positions, Max.  The fear of the Church being undone by change only serves to immobilize you and others, in direct opposition to the belief (that you and all Christians share) that Jesus the Christ will never leave us, that He is with us till the end of time.  That means that even in view of the foolish mistakes the men of the Church make repeatedly, the Church will not fail.  But I, personally, do not want to appear before God and not be able to say that I did all I could to help correct those mistakes made in His name.  If it is left to you, as shown in your comment here, nothing would be done because you fear the outcome.  ""Oh ye of so little faith.""",0,-9.438860237599288,9.438860237599288
7,"""He [the pope] told us that it was all right to study the evolution 
    of the universe after the big bang, but we should not inquire
    into the big bang itself because that was the moment of Creation 
    and therefore the work of God. I was glad then 
    that he did not know the subject of the talk 
    I had just given at the conference - the possibility 
    that space-time was finite but had no boundary, which means that it 
    had no beginning, no moment of Creation. I had no desire to share the fate of
    Galileo, with whom I feel a strong sense of identity, partly because of 
    the coincidence of having been born exactly 300 years after his death!""

38,"Please quote and copy/paste that *oath of fidelity* to both the extraordinary & ordinary magisterium?
Talk about preaching out of thin air?  They make a promise to the ordaining bishop - nothing more.
Again, you show no understanding of nuance; that there is no one way of understanding the faith truths - there are only a handful of dogmas that meet your definition.  The rest are a hierarchy of church truths that require different levels of personal response.  You conflate everything to an all or nothing proposition which has nothing to do with our baptismal call, mission, relationship to church/Christ or our journey of faith.  Not every church or papal pronouncement carries the same weight!!!

44,"MC, you are not serious are you?  The three felony convictions are irrelevant if we believe that a convicted person who serves their time is given a chance to re-enter society to be a productive member.  Such methodology is best for all concerned.  You are holding his convictions from the past out as proof that he is no good and should be arrested and incarcerated.  But the only valid argument is based on his recent actions which are clearly in question.  The dispute with the woman was over.  While some say she was still at risk, this is nonsense because by her statements he had a gun but let her go after she returned his sweat pants - the reputed source of the dispute.  I wonder what kind of woman would be going with a 3x felon on parole.  Is she reliable?  We do not know, yet you and some others condemn the man and validate police policy to kill him if necessary to secure his surrender.

20,"For starters were not talking about mistresses were talking about rape victims. I think that the disconnect here stems from the fact that the Hillary supporters think that all she did was denounce her husband's rape victims publicly To date over 45 women have accused Bill Clinton of raping them starting with the young girl whom he raped during his first semester at Oxford causing him to be expelled from the program. After each rape victim would come forward Hillary would go on a campaign of bullying, threatening, and intimidation against each one of them. This included sending people to their homes, to their work to deliver threatening messages which all consisted of threats to them both physically and emotionally.
