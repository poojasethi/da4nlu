11,"While the wonderful and historic speech to the Protestant ministers is highly regarded by objective American historians as a powerful transforming address, we must admit that the Catholic hierarchy--then and now--said it did NOT reflect Church teaching.  Archbishop Chaput's contemporary (2010) criticism of it is a must-read--and I am afraid it reflects the views of many...too many. Indeed, it shows a wide gap in Catholic thought.

We should discuss that disparity more, especially amid current debates about freedom of religion and separation of church and state.",0,-17.193416777924885,17.193416777924885
33,"Myth? You wish. Just think, LOTL: how many Catholics on this site alone agree with you on Church doctrine? Not many. So divisions among Catholics really do exist.

19,"Unassigned bishops and bishops with titular sees do not have dioceses as their flocks, just as many of the Apostles did not.

They remain successors to the Apostles and shepherds to the flock.

Their situations provide them the opportunity, unlike their fellow bishops who still have careers and full ""to do"" lists in front of them, to risk unpopularity in doing hard things.",0,-14.181478611493205,14.181478611493205

25,"But have you noticed that both Christmas and Easter celebrations begin with night-time liturgies?  And this by ancient traditions?

26,"One has to wonder why they want to push this fact.  

I understand they're trying to push the narrative that there aren't problems with the refugees but if the problem isn't rooted in their actions where does one look to as the common source of terrorism?  Now we're left to consider that maybe it's the religion that we should be concerned with.

We want to believe the problem isn't Islam, it's simply a small portion of followers from backwards nations that still practice religious fundamentalism.

That's a position that has less and less validity as attacks are committed by others of the faith born and raised in supposedly moderate/secular societies.",0,-2.013871713331495,2.013871713331495
