43,"Motley:  If you wish to address ""black racism"", then address black racism.  I, for example, have addressed Charles' comments when I feel they stereotype us ""white folks"".  We're obviously not all alike and it's unfair to ""lump"" us all together....and, yes, to do so IMO constitutes ""racism"".....that ""black racism"" you reference.  I feel Charles' comments and observasions are very valuable and provide a worthwhile perspective.  I agree with much he says and disagree with some of it.....when I do, I say so.  I feel the same about you and try to treat your comments in the same fashion.  I'm suggesting, and you may find it presumptuous, that you might consider treating Charles with respect and dignity.  He may say things with which you disagree.....fine....disagree with them.  ""Put downs"", ad hominem attacks and nasty, dismissive comments do nothing to advance civil discourse.  ...I know I'll be accused of being the ""hall monitor"" for these comments.   That's OK, I've been called worse.  GC",0,-9.61241039867675,9.61241039867675

9,"Thank you, Sheila. Notice please how all the victims' organizations (most branches of SNAP) are led by active Catholics and women. When 80% of all victims are male.Most of the victims I've met are no longer Catholics and as far as women victims leading us. I support women's leadeship in all matters but odds-wise this is neigh on impossible. Why would the scam choose women to lead ? 2 very good reasons to heterosexualize the abuse and to appear liberal to liberal Catholics when neither are true. SNAP has aimed victims away from seeking compensation. That's what Doyle had planned since the '80's. Doyle's banishment by the church was a fraud to give him credence. I have all the documents that when seen would warrant a real investigation but NCR won't even look. Meanwhile victims rot as SNAP implodes, as it was always intended to do, leaving victims smeared as fraudulant claiments and SNAP being sued by priests for libel. If you have any connecions who would help bring this to light. Do.",0,-9.504358774467818,9.504358774467818

1,The only person responsible is Khadr and his family of treasonous cowards. The Khadr's are Canadians of convenience who are a disgrace to Canada - they should be deported to Pakistan with nothing more than the clothes on their backs. Anyone who sympathizes with Khadr should be ashamed to call themselves Canadian.,0,-9.236234489365607,9.236234489365607

8,"It turns out that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos didn’t provide details on the plan to privatize America’s schools during her big speech Monday night. 




     She mostly just insulted people who disagreed with her while offering simplistic, misleading comparisons and platitudes.





     ""If you hear nothing else I say tonight, please hear this – education should not be a partisan issue.""





     Said the woman who has dedicated millions of her family’s fortune to waging partisan warfare on the public education system.",0,-9.182441148325186,9.182441148325186
19,"""The president is a man with no moral compass. We knew that a year ago when he won the presidency.""

Actually, that's been known for many decades by anyone with eyes to see, ears to hear, and a brain to think. The fact that millions of supposedly ""faithful"" Catholics overlooked that glaring truth and pulled the lever for Trump anyway is something with which their own consciences will have to contend. I especially liked this sentence:

""Indeed, the pro-life cause, like the concern for religious liberty, will emerge bruised and battered from its having been associated with this man.""

That's true for anyone or anything that gets anywhere near the anti-Midas: it all turns to merde.",0,-9.156451515538116,9.156451515538116
23,"Interesting article, but Dlamini-Zuma (and Bathabile Dlamini and Mokonyane) remains a Zuptoid who is lending her gender as a smokescreen to the patriarchal and sickening theft of our country. She isn't advancing the cause of women in leadership, she is advancing treason, and deserves our contempt.",0,-8.53946956606266,8.53946956606266

3,"Of course, there is a double standard and many people have raised the same concern.

The fact that charges were dropped is not the same as saying that the assault did not happen. But no one takes spousal assault seriously when a woman attacks a man.",0,-6.6194195633467965,6.6194195633467965

36,"I am a teacher, Bryant. Hawaii is my summer home. Who I work for is none of your business. What a stupid question. 
Why are you so sour about your police? How many tickets for bad driving have you received in the past? Perhaps youre a criminal and are corrupt just like you accuse your police of being. Oh wait, I know what happened to you. You couldn't pass that silly little ""test"" you're referring to. 
Police officers come from the community and you're right, they're not immune from human mistakes. 
HPD is no different from any other major metropolitan police department. 
Would you like to know what police corruption is? Research LAPD Rampart Division. That's corruption. 
HPD is a fine organization and is doing a fine job!

Take that ""test"" (again) you seem to know all about and give it a go if you think you can do a better job.",0,-5.717876201264267,5.717876201264267

20,"For starters were not talking about mistresses were talking about rape victims. I think that the disconnect here stems from the fact that the Hillary supporters think that all she did was denounce her husband's rape victims publicly To date over 45 women have accused Bill Clinton of raping them starting with the young girl whom he raped during his first semester at Oxford causing him to be expelled from the program. After each rape victim would come forward Hillary would go on a campaign of bullying, threatening, and intimidation against each one of them. This included sending people to their homes, to their work to deliver threatening messages which all consisted of threats to them both physically and emotionally. She had pets killed, she had cars vandalized, she had people followed night and day. Check out the YouTube videos of these rape victims telling their story",0,-4.945687724875943,4.945687724875943
30,The torture thing...ignore it.  It's just a sparkly thing intended to take your eye off of the other hand picking your wallet.  You can count on the press falling for Trump's trick over and over.
