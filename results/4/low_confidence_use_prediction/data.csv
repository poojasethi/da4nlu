39,"Again, you are dead wrong. This ""chapter"" shouldn't be closed until these slimy bastards are held accountable and have paid the proper penalties for this travesty. To defend the players or any part of this debacle or to try to divert attention elsewhere makes you no better than them.",0,-10.796912004188037,10.796912004188037
21,"Among some women, there is a condition known as that which you can't spell it out here.  To say so is not Trumpean.  As for my mother:  I don;t need a lecture from you about what a wonderful woman she was, and I adored her, as I do most women of good character.  I doesn't occur to me to fear them; I'm drawn to them, as my mother and father taught me to be.  Some women, however, I find repulsive --- though not as repulsive as my good mother thought they are.",0,-10.77361058941602,10.77361058941602
16,"I think there is a good argument that t-Rump hasn't had a real job his whole life.  He went bankrupt how many times?  Didn't pay the workers who actually DID work.  He started a college that stole money from people who believed him and paid out of court settlements for that.  He brags about grabbing women, makes fun of people with disabilities.  He's a slimy, lying sociopath who needs to go away.",0,-10.595982174114823,10.595982174114823
24,"Plain silly comment.   Coach Robyn is dressed appropriately and neatly for her job.  Your comment on attire is inappropriate as it has nothing to do with her accomplishments or coaching job/ability.  (Do you know anything about volleyball - I am guessing not).  Apply the same dress standard for any male coach, and see if anybody gives a hoot.  This should be a non-issue.  Unfortunately, this type of inane comment should have no bearing on her ability, but gain attention because its simply ludicrous in this day and age.  Go BOWS!",0,-10.55329975090952,10.55329975090952

17,"If I had to constructively  criticize my Mexican friends,  it would be the lack of making progress speaking English.  Most of them are working twice as hard as most Americans though.  The women generally have the most free time to learn English, but we do make it too easy for them to avoid learning some English.  
I only say this in the spirit of Tough Love as it would help them not be so hated here if people actually knew what kind of people the majority are and how they actually live their lives.

When I go to So. America, I am usually forced to speak Espa√±ol to interact with people.  I love the language though. It is beautiful.",0,-9.890562924554654,9.890562924554654
18,"What an inane, superfluous question.  It is a false equivalency and a spurious comparison. White people dont need to state the obvious, black experiences dont map onto white ones.  Whites arent 3x more likely to be killed by police or deemed on sight to be dangerous/suspect/criminal whether they be saint or sinner.  If Dafonte Miller was white would theriault have beaten him to a pulp?  If Philandro Castile was and told the cop he had a gun/carry permit would he have been murdered in front of his 4-year child?  Would eric garner be chocked to death on a street corner; would Jonathan Ferrell have had 12 bullets pumped into him (knocked on a door looking for help after car accident?); Walter Scott shot in the back? 

BLMs point is that their lives matter TOO just like yours.  They are a response to anti-black racism/police brutality; a demand to acknowledge their humanity the way they/you do yours.  Its no different than the civil rights movement's response to jim crow/white hate/racism.",0,-9.806628223651558,9.806628223651558

And how many invaded a foreign land under false pretenses, overthrew its government, instituted a torture regime, decimated civil liberties at home while instituting a national spy state?

38,"At first I was amused by your boneheadedness.  The question I KEEP asking is how well does your family get along?  You have no problem attacking the President's family.  I also asked do they work at the same job too. Since you didn't answer either time I will assume the answer is no.  But you keep pounding away in futility.  Then you attack my sexuality.  Waaa, waaa. Frankly I would love to talk about my sex life, but my gal won't let me.  I know you're counting on something (you little perv) but no, I'm not going to let you have it.  Further I'm tired of dealing with the ""likes"" of you, so shut up, go away, and leave me alone (w/my lover), and go find a dry towel and a dirty magazine.",0,-3.3790527638290335,3.3790527638290335
