The archaic saving face philosophy leaves China without any teeth in the issue other that to threaten others not to take action. Possibly what is needed is a third party, other than Japan, to take action with either the backing of the US, China or both.",0,-3.3115726057699755,3.3115726057699755

His wife was helping him drug and molest girls?   I think Alaska, being the Number One rape state in the nation, needs an Office of Rape and Sexual Ethics.

I understand they're trying to push the narrative that there aren't problems with the refugees but if the problem isn't rooted in their actions where does one look to as the common source of terrorism?  Now we're left to consider that maybe it's the religion that we should be concerned with.

We want to believe the problem isn't Islam, it's simply a small portion of followers from backwards nations that still practice religious fundamentalism.
