11,"While the wonderful and historic speech to the Protestant ministers is highly regarded by objective American historians as a powerful transforming address, we must admit that the Catholic hierarchy--then and now--said it did NOT reflect Church teaching.  Archbishop Chaput's contemporary (2010) criticism of it is a must-read--and I am afraid it reflects the views of many...too many. Indeed, it shows a wide gap in Catholic thought.

We should discuss that disparity more, especially amid current debates about freedom of religion and separation of church and state.",0,-17.1820181963864,17.1820181963864

19,"Unassigned bishops and bishops with titular sees do not have dioceses as their flocks, just as many of the Apostles did not.

They remain successors to the Apostles and shepherds to the flock.

Their situations provide them the opportunity, unlike their fellow bishops who still have careers and full ""to do"" lists in front of them, to risk unpopularity in doing hard things.",0,-14.916448038242622,14.916448038242622
