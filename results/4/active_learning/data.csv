30,"Not talking about fornicating. Men and women need to deal with their sex drive whatever way they see fit. But for the man just make damn sure you don't impregnate a women until you're ready to have a child with her. Yes that applies to women too. Of course such  a law would be near impossible to enforce but so was abortion before 1973. If you want to go the legal route to protect the unborn just remember its egg & sperm. Then let's find every root cause of abortion and work to eliminate it like poverty, social pressure, dignity of women etc. But to simply think law alone works and just the female end to save the unborn is not realistic. There were more abortions in the lower east side neighborhood in my family circle before '73 then after. And now Google Trends has found 'do it yourself' abortions increasing in states with tight laws. See if I can find link. I've said enough here.",0,-13.61065006934112,13.61065006934112
41,"The scientific method is very similar to journalistic integrity- explore an event, object or condition and discover the facts, regardless of where said information may lead the investigator.  Now- media bias, especially from the 'right', front loads the conclusion- much as we see in religious institutions- the facts MUST FIT the dogma of their beliefs.  

As if that wasn't enough of a challenge, now we have the Russians taking full advantage of American bias and partisan behavior.  Our unchecked open forums allow (entice?) anyone to become a 'journalist'.  For those here who are on the R side of the aisle- just imagine how you would be acting if it 17 US intel agencies had stated that HRC's campaign had met with the Russians.  

In Alabama, the special congressional election to replace Sessions has theocrat Roy Moore as the R candidate.  We now find out that he has 30,000 Russian twitter 'followers'.

11,"Thank you, I have pondered similar meanings from this Genesis 3 story as well...as a matter of fact in the last couple of days as I pondered this and other sections of Genesis, a few others popped into my head and impacted me greatly concerning God's infinite, boundless mercy that is, as Chrizmart has beautifully said, full of compassion.  Namely, when the man and woman disobeyed (which as their Creator, he could have done), destroyed them as fault-ridden.  We know of course, that He did not do that.  2nd.  Adam is refered to as beast of burden.  Jesus chose a beast of burden to ride into Jerusalem.    3rd. The story of Balaam and the donkey in Numbers is important as well.  Again, a story about who will take the lead?  Ours, God's?  And in this case, there are times God's Will is expressed through the least likely of His Creation...because they are ones listening--not us.

7,"""How does a seriously disturbed man build such an empire"" This was your statement, nothing there about being ""voted in"". Cruel and greedy for money and power fits Trump to a T. The only question is can he rise to the same ""heights"" the other three did. Only time will tell. 
My comments are ""offensive""? A Trump supporter with thin skin, who'd a thunk.
