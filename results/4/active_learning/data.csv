26,"One has to wonder why they want to push this fact.  

I understand they're trying to push the narrative that there aren't problems with the refugees but if the problem isn't rooted in their actions where does one look to as the common source of terrorism?  Now we're left to consider that maybe it's the religion that we should be concerned with.

We want to believe the problem isn't Islam, it's simply a small portion of followers from backwards nations that still practice religious fundamentalism.

That's a position that has less and less validity as attacks are committed by others of the faith born and raised in supposedly moderate/secular societies.",0,-9.200828135123302,9.200828135123302
32,"It is my guess that China, having let the fat kid with the crazy hair cut run amok for so long, is now afraid of North Korea and its limited nuclear capacity. The archaic saving face philosophy leaves China without any teeth in the issue other that to threaten others not to take action. Possibly what is needed is a third party, other than Japan, to take action with either the backing of the US, China or both.",1,-8.867896000328617,8.867896000328617

Didn't prevent all those people from getting killed in Vietnam or keep any other President from killing his selected group in the name of National Security.  

Reagan, Bush, HW, Clinton, Bush, GW, Obama and now Trump.  They have all killed in Lebanon, Granada, Bosnia, Somalia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Libya, Syria.  Some of them in more than one of those.

41,"Scottish politicians represent the worst of the breed. So much for sober, thrifty and intelligence traits. How many Quebec like, ""knife to the throat"" mentalities can a federation withstand? Undo a treasure friend an ally in trying times, do not expect embrace and applause. Unwilling to await negotiation results with the EU, irresponsible elements commit to put the Scottish people to the next bruising instalment of neverendum referendums where the status quo is constantly challenged and need only lose once.

4,"Holy cow.  is ""The Bull"" real?   This sounds like bad fiction...but it obviously isn't.

His wife was helping him drug and molest girls?   I think Alaska, being the Number One rape state in the nation, needs an Office of Rape and Sexual Ethics.   But the investigational muscle needed for that would cost us taxes....and the voters here would say ""it would't be the conservative choice""...and try to pin the rape epidemic on a transgendered person using the bathroom, something that has never happened in Alaska or anywhere else.",1,-7.5443101707514835,7.5443101707514835

39,"Here it is again. Former President Bill Clinton told an audience that he could have had Osama bin Laden killed, not once but four times, but chose not to, because an attack would have endangered innocent women and children, in 1998. So instead, Osama Bin Laden killed 2,763 innocent Americans.

Slimy and deplorable.

This is starting to look a lot like 2008, where a cabal of unscrupulous people made out like bandits selling bad debt to credulous patsies.  I don't think this will end well.",0,-6.623336173796867,6.623336173796867
