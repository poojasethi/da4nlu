10,"For me, Pope Francis is lending credibility to the Church as one may, if he or she so wishes, perceive the work of the Holy Spirit in his words and actions. This does not mean that everyone must accept uncritically everything he says because he said it. It is more a matter of spiritual discernment. The search for certitude in Canon law is doomed to failure. 
    If one reads the words of Jesus in the Gospels he explicitly says that His teaching on marriage is for those to whom it is given-not everyone can accept it. Those who can, do. Uta Rankh Heinemann, a German theologian who took the Church to task for its historical denigration of marriage in EUNUCHS FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD has suggested this very thing, which is a credible reading of the Gospel text instead of assuming that it refers to making oneself a eunuch as Origen took to extremes with self-castration. No-one in authority has accused him of sinning against nature by so doing. They well might do so.",0,-7.4616287179767475,7.4616287179767475

Judah: I agree with your assessment of Ohio Dan.  But, of course, it doesn't take cojones to stand up to Trump & McConnell & the GOP's ""leaders"" -- it just takes a spine.
.

In the Senate's recent vote of life&death importance to so many people, the only GOP-ers who stood up for their constituents were two WOMEN and, of course, fearless McCain (a Veteran whose wartime heroism was so appallingly dissed & ridiculed by 'our' draft-dodging Twit-in-Chief).
.

P.S.: While Senator Susan Collins won't waiver under future threats (or career-advancement promises) from Mr.T, from GOP ""leaders"" or from Koch superPAC$, I have no such confidence in Murkowski. Her history & duplicity strongly suggest that her #1 goal will always be to promote her personal political ambitions No Matter How Much Deceit It Takes every 6 years. Her sense of entitlement can override any trace of ethics & any unlikely impulse to speak w/o her usual platitudes & doublespeak when campaigning here as a pretend-independent.",1,-6.411695378789386,6.411695378789386

7,"Don,  did Jesus condone Adultery, Abortion, marriage between a man/man or woman/woman? Did God make a man in his image,  who would later decide for himself that he should now be woman?  Did Jesus tell us since he is an all loving God, that everyone will go to heaven, and that Hell is empty?  Did Jesus condone cohabitation and sexual relations outside of marriage?    With all your prior seminary training I hope you can clear up those simple questions for this simple minded Pharisee?",0,-6.085903757325521,6.085903757325521

24,"Plain silly comment.   Coach Robyn is dressed appropriately and neatly for her job.  Your comment on attire is inappropriate as it has nothing to do with her accomplishments or coaching job/ability.  (Do you know anything about volleyball - I am guessing not).  Apply the same dress standard for any male coach, and see if anybody gives a hoot.  This should be a non-issue.  Unfortunately, this type of inane comment should have no bearing on her ability, but gain attention because its simply ludicrous in this day and age.  Go BOWS!",1,-5.262214483789982,5.262214483789982

As for my mother:  I don;t need a lecture from you about what a wonderful woman she was, and I adored her, as I do most women of good character.  I doesn't occur to me to fear them; I'm drawn to them, as my mother and father taught me to be.

18,"What an inane, superfluous question.  It is a false equivalency and a spurious comparison. White people dont need to state the obvious, black experiences dont map onto white ones.  Whites arent 3x more likely to be killed by police or deemed on sight to be dangerous/suspect/criminal whether they be saint or sinner.  If Dafonte Miller was white would theriault have beaten him to a pulp?  If Philandro Castile was and told the cop he had a gun/carry permit would he have been murdered in front of his 4-year child?  Would eric garner be chocked to death on a street corner; would Jonathan Ferrell have had 12 bullets pumped into him (knocked on a door looking for help after car accident?); Walter Scott shot in the back? 

BLMs point is that their lives matter TOO just like yours.  They are a response to anti-black racism/police brutality; a demand to acknowledge their humanity the way they/you do yours.

I also asked do they work at the same job too. Since you didn't answer either time I will assume the answer is no.  But you keep pounding away in futility.  Then you attack my sexuality.  Waaa, waaa. Frankly I would love to talk about my sex life, but my gal won't let me.  I know you're counting on something (you little perv) but no, I'm not going to let you have it.
