38,"Please quote and copy/paste that *oath of fidelity* to both the extraordinary & ordinary magisterium?
Talk about preaching out of thin air?  They make a promise to the ordaining bishop - nothing more.
Again, you show no understanding of nuance; that there is no one way of understanding the faith truths - there are only a handful of dogmas that meet your definition.  The rest are a hierarchy of church truths that require different levels of personal response.  You conflate everything to an all or nothing proposition which has nothing to do with our baptismal call, mission, relationship to church/Christ or our journey of faith.  Not every church or papal pronouncement carries the same weight!!!

37,"Now we see the great worry that is behind your positions, Max.  The fear of the Church being undone by change only serves to immobilize you and others, in direct opposition to the belief (that you and all Christians share) that Jesus the Christ will never leave us, that He is with us till the end of time.  That means that even in view of the foolish mistakes the men of the Church make repeatedly, the Church will not fail.  But I, personally, do not want to appear before God and not be able to say that I did all I could to help correct those mistakes made in His name.  If it is left to you, as shown in your comment here, nothing would be done because you fear the outcome.  ""Oh ye of so little faith.""",1,-12.3581634401313,12.3581634401313
7,"""He [the pope] told us that it was all right to study the evolution 
    of the universe after the big bang, but we should not inquire
    into the big bang itself because that was the moment of Creation 
    and therefore the work of God. I was glad then 
    that he did not know the subject of the talk 
    I had just given at the conference - the possibility 
    that space-time was finite but had no boundary, which means that it 
    had no beginning, no moment of Creation. I had no desire to share the fate of
    Galileo, with whom I feel a strong sense of identity, partly because of 
    the coincidence of having been born exactly 300 years after his death!""

44,"MC, you are not serious are you?  The three felony convictions are irrelevant if we believe that a convicted person who serves their time is given a chance to re-enter society to be a productive member.  Such methodology is best for all concerned.  You are holding his convictions from the past out as proof that he is no good and should be arrested and incarcerated.  But the only valid argument is based on his recent actions which are clearly in question.  The dispute with the woman was over.  While some say she was still at risk, this is nonsense because by her statements he had a gun but let her go after she returned his sweat pants - the reputed source of the dispute.  I wonder what kind of woman would be going with a 3x felon on parole.  Is she reliable?  We do not know, yet you and some others condemn the man and validate police policy to kill him if necessary to secure his surrender.

31,"Historical catholicism, the best history you can read.  The butchery , the salacious comings and goings among the nuns and priests no different then the most talked about religion in the press today.  Did you know the Pope's son became Pope but they stopped that when they introduced the concept of Virginity and Purity.   The true translation from Hebrew text means first born but the Church bastardized the word to mean what people today know  as virgin birth.  Because Pope's sons were prevented from taking over you had the break up of the Roman order, one went east and the other went west.  East Orthodox vs Roman Catholicism.   THe concept of Virginity did not get introduced till about 1150 AD.  You see virginity is more on the mind of men and ownership of women because women once were property of man  and this is why marriage was invented.

32,"Thanks for pointing out the letter of that law.  Now why don't go and take a look at the lesser known spirit of that law which also governs the Church's tradition of papal correction.   The Church has had more than 40+ antipopes (out of 266 popes) in its 2,000 year history so there is a rich but more obscure tradition of teaching in that area.  You can start with St. Paul or St. Jerome or St. Bellarmine.

Maybe afterward, you can then focus on the substance of the correction, which they have limited to 7 major heresies.  There is a count of major and minor errors in AL that go up as high, but 7 should suffice to start.   Remember, all it takes is one manifest heresy for a pope to automatically cease to be pope.

It may take years and decades for this pope to be corrected, but he WILL be corrected by a God who will not be mocked.  You can already tell that from the kind of rabid support that this pope gets from catholics who support abortion, homosexuality and euthanasia.",0,-7.928119721764837,7.928119721764837
