11,"While the wonderful and historic speech to the Protestant ministers is highly regarded by objective American historians as a powerful transforming address, we must admit that the Catholic hierarchy--then and now--said it did NOT reflect Church teaching.  Archbishop Chaput's contemporary (2010) criticism of it is a must-read--and I am afraid it reflects the views of many...too many. Indeed, it shows a wide gap in Catholic thought.

We should discuss that disparity more, especially amid current debates about freedom of religion and separation of church and state.",0,-17.269958624573707,17.269958624573707
33,"Myth? You wish. Just think, LOTL: how many Catholics on this site alone agree with you on Church doctrine? Not many. So divisions among Catholics really do exist.

19,"Unassigned bishops and bishops with titular sees do not have dioceses as their flocks, just as many of the Apostles did not.

They remain successors to the Apostles and shepherds to the flock.

Their situations provide them the opportunity, unlike their fellow bishops who still have careers and full ""to do"" lists in front of them, to risk unpopularity in doing hard things.",0,-15.140917306354332,15.140917306354332

In fact, I have at invitation publicly debated at length 'Jimmy' Marr on two occasions at Pacifica forum events soundly defeating him both times.

In particular his twisted attempts in which he uses the bible, Christianity, Christian history and theology in justifying Hitler's reign of terror and his denial of the [Hitler's] Holocaust. Mr. Marr is certainly without any question among the most uneducated people on the planet I have ever met on the subject of Christianity.
