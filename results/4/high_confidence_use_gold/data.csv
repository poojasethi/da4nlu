32,"According to this article: WASHINGTON — Churches should have the First Amendment right to endorse political candidates and still keep their tax-free status, say House Republicans, who quietly tucked a provision into a sweeping spending bill that would deny the IRS money to enforce the 63-year-old law prohibiting such outright politicking from the pulpit.
...the measure could upend the system of campaign financing by allowing churches to use their tax-free status to funnel money to political candidates.
“All they care about is the Christian groups, and in particular, it will end up as the extreme religious right Christian groups,” Little said. “If this goes through, this would add just another way in which unregulated dark money could be used.”
If churches are donating money they are also dictating legislation. If they are dictating legislation, they become the law-makers. How is that any different that what is occurring in Iran, other than the type of religion?",0,-11.883527221265886,11.883527221265886
22,"At mass I've seen old people, I've seen families.   But  I've never seen one ""Trent Horn"" like young person who discovered Catholicism in High School and was truly enthralled with it.  The odds of sighting an ardent young person at mass are like the odds of meeting a cougar on the hiking trail.

If there has ever been a popular movement of young people in the Church,  I'm unaware of it.

On the other hand, there's the protestants.   They do draw young people.   And their views on sexuality and women's rights aren't necessarily far different from Catholicism's.

Broadly speaking, what are these protestant churches doing that Catholicism isn't?   That's the fruitful question.   They are doing a lot of things that appeal to people's needs.   

The Catholic strategy seems uninterested in that, and is sticking with oldster pro Catholics babytalk on  1)   Endless catechesis (zzzz)  2)  Culture warfare with a focus on the pelvis.

5,"Dunsmuir and Schneider write: “The Fed’s preferred measure of underlying inflation has retreated to 1.5 per cent, from 1.8 per cent earlier this year, and has run below the central bank’s 2 per cent target for more than five years.” This is false. The US Fed targets the personal consumption expenditures price index (PCEPI). It was at 2.2% in February, but has since dropped to 1.7% in April. Except for February 2017 it has only exceeded its two percent target from January to April 2012, i.e. in the month the US Fed officially adopted an inflation target rate with the PCEPI as its indicator. Dunsmuir and Schneider are referencing the PCEPI excluding food and energy (PCEPILFE), a core PCEPI measure, and the preferred one of the US Fed, although they also follow a trimmed mean core measure quite closely. It did fall from an inflation rate of 1.8% in January and February to 1.5% in April and has never been at or above the two percent target from January 2012 forward.",0,-10.20623283610988,10.20623283610988

27,"Even Pope Francis has weighed in on this, inviting National Conferences of Bishops the world over to ordain ""proven"" laypeople (married parishioners living Christian lives in their parishes). But the Bishops don't budge. Maybe they fear the Curia? It is a ""mystery."" But a ""crisis,"" that under no circumstances can be  solved???? I don't think so. If the Curia fears Francis's presence in Rome inviting bishops to take action, they would hate him absent, too, taking away from them a scapegoat, among other things. But shame on our bishops for not taking up the pope's invitation. There are certainly good laypeople out there who could be ordained.",0,-8.420185431696316,8.420185431696316
