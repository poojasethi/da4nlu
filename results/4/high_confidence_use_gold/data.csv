34,"""I don't understand why Catholic schools should be supported by the government. ""

Firs, in Canada, government support for Catholic education is guaranteed by Constitution.

Second, if your question is about principles, it would have some merit if Catholics, or those wanting to support Catholic education, could earmark their tax dollars for that. But, they are not allowed to do so. On the contrary, they are coerced by government and its legal apparatus to support education that they do not make use of or value. 

At the same time, non-Catholics under the auspices of tolerance, inclusion and equality, do not want to support what they don't use or value, i.e., Catholic education.

Don't you just love the great idea of 'equality under the law', and the political correctness that always manages to find exception to it when it is expedient?",0,-13.973994794445645,13.973994794445645
0,"I know several financially successful women that followed steps 1 and 2, but decided to have children (or adopt) in their thirties. I know several others that struggle financially, in large part because their marriages fell apart after children (compounding the economic impact). That doesn't contradict the research; it supports it at a more granular level.

My point, really, is that delaying childbirth until you've established economic stability is the core prerequisite to maintaining economic stability. You'll be ahead if you can do this while in a stable marriage (or long term relationship), either because two incomes are better than one, or because one party can maintain employment while the other raises kids. But it is successfully done all the time.  What is rarely successfully done, as you and the research point out, is achieving economic success when childbirth precedes economic stability (or, if you prefer, education and career) - regardless of marital status.",0,-10.070837679257046,10.070837679257046

25,It is a good bet that this law was passed to appease particular investors who suffered financially when Bill Browder was declared persona non grata in Russia. Follow the money and you will find the real reasons for this and much other legislation. It is a shame that the House of Commons voted unanimously for this piece of legalistic nonsense. If MPs were allowed to vote their conscience and if they could vote by secret ballot - free from intimidation and coercion by powerful special interest groups -  legislative travesties such as the Magnitsky law might not see the light of day.,0,-8.708039257888878,8.708039257888878

3,"Writing under the headline ""numbers don't lie..."" Mr Dogterom however conspicuously fails to mention any numbers.  Here are some to fill the hole he leaves.

According to the Independent Electricity System Operator, nuclear provided 60% of all electricity consumed in Ontario in 2015.  Hydro provided 24%. Renewables provided less than 8%.

As for costs, the Ontario Energy Board reports that in its regulated price plan for 2014 to 2015 that each unit of hydro generation cost 5.,1 c/kWhr. Nuclear cost 5.9 c/kWhr.  Wind was more than double these rates at 12.3 c/kWhr. As for solar--out of sight at 47.6c/kWhr.

So Mr Dogterom is right on one thing: the numbers don't lie. What the numbers tell us however is that nuclear and hydro generation provide Ontario consumers with low-cost, carbon-free electricity.  And the renewables industry on the margins is less about harvesting nature's bounty than it is about harvesting the subsidized rates handed out by the ON government.",0,-7.275526764900654,7.275526764900654

Judah: I agree with your assessment of Ohio Dan.  But, of course, it doesn't take cojones to stand up to Trump & McConnell & the GOP's ""leaders"" -- it just takes a spine.
.

In the Senate's recent vote of life&death importance to so many people, the only GOP-ers who stood up for their constituents were two WOMEN and, of course, fearless McCain (a Veteran whose wartime heroism was so appallingly dissed & ridiculed by 'our' draft-dodging Twit-in-Chief).
.

P.S.: While Senator Susan Collins won't waiver under future threats (or career-advancement promises) from Mr.T, from GOP ""leaders"" or from Koch superPAC$, I have no such confidence in Murkowski. Her history & duplicity strongly suggest that her #1 goal will always be to promote her personal political ambitions No Matter How Much Deceit It Takes every 6 years. Her sense of entitlement can override any trace of ethics & any unlikely impulse to speak w/o her usual platitudes & doublespeak when campaigning here as a pretend-independent.",1,-6.5734382278260375,6.5734382278260375

41,"Key point - you're 45 years in practice.  So you're very much a part of an older generation of doctors.    My Dad was even older and worked similar hours (delivered babies too).   

One of the hidden and non-discussed issues is the choice of medicine as a life-style choice.   In the past (even older than your practice) - medicine was a calling.   It still is for many (hopefully the majority) but the reality is, a growing portion of our medical graduates chose medicine for the wrong reasons.    EG:  In a major urban center - try to find a young, female GP.    I was shocked at the number who required membership fees at a clinic where 6 partners worked the equivalent of 3 full time doctors.    These are the type of doctors complaining the loudest.      One of the hidden problems is the number of NEW graduates who end up working a part-time career as a choice because our system allows and rewards that.

10,"For me, Pope Francis is lending credibility to the Church as one may, if he or she so wishes, perceive the work of the Holy Spirit in his words and actions. This does not mean that everyone must accept uncritically everything he says because he said it. It is more a matter of spiritual discernment. The search for certitude in Canon law is doomed to failure. 
    If one reads the words of Jesus in the Gospels he explicitly says that His teaching on marriage is for those to whom it is given-not everyone can accept it. Those who can, do. Uta Rankh Heinemann, a German theologian who took the Church to task for its historical denigration of marriage in EUNUCHS FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD has suggested this very thing, which is a credible reading of the Gospel text instead of assuming that it refers to making oneself a eunuch as Origen took to extremes with self-castration.
