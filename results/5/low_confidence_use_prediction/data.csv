33,"Wow so for you all you are worried about is freedom on a motion that does not affect anyone's rights in any way because all it is is a motion. Does that include the freedom to incite violence and hatred against Muslims? This is just about a ""wedge issue"" and the fact that six Muslims were murdered in an Islamophobic attack is irrelevant? For the record could you please state that you oppose violence and hatred towards Muslims? Most of the ""free speech"" crowd won't do that, will they, because we know what their purpose is, don't we, and that is persecution of Muslims.",0,-5.545582763184275,5.545582763184275

Donald Trump isn't nearly intelligent enough to be president of the greatest country on earth--not by a long shot. LOL--I always knew America would go this way--the dirty way women are treated here is a constant reminder of the fascist heart of white, ""Christian"" America.

12,"Too funny.

No little fella, it is not.

A 22 fold increase over 40 years equates to an approximately 8% growth rate.

A six fold increase over 20 years equates to a greater than 9% annual growth rate.

You sure are clever. By the way, the obvious flaw in your arithmetic comparison  is so obvious, a smart 4th grader should be able to figure it out. I'll leave it as a little puzzle for you. Genius.

Regardless for the record, even with a drop in the annual increase of the Muslim population to 7%, in 60 years that translates to approximately 60 million people. Let's take 2/3 of that and say 45 million.

As I stated, and as is exactly true, without a change in demographic trends, and unless muslims in Canada suddenly catch this secularism trend you're all excited about, Canadians will be regularly hearing the call of the muezzin within 60 years.",0,-3.594449184656977,3.594449184656977

Don't confuse test results with kids being educated and respectful. Look at how many college students who probably got boffo test scores think the 1A shouldn't apply to hate speech or, really, anything they disagree with, & think violence is fine.

Cherrypicking Texas to claim US schools are being controlled by Republican/conservative education ideology is really absurd. Your characterization of it is also wrong. https://www.texastribune.org/2017/04/19/texas-education-board-evolution-standards-/

Any problems in schools are due to Democrats & organized labor? I never said any such thing.  I did point out that they have been dominant in education for decades. I said that arguing for them to continue dominance so we can have ""educated voters who understand each other"" is a silly argument, in view of what we are seeing on college campuses as the product of current education.

21,"The liberal ""politically correct"" ethos is drowning out even Muslims that want to help and condemn this type of brutal violence by their most radical flanks --I think they call this irony. No law abiding, responsible Muslim citizen wants their children involved with these insidious terrorist groups; no more than white parents want their kids in neo-Nazi gangs, or black parents want their kids hanging around with the Bloods and Crips. Let Muslims help by speaking out and identifying these radical elements within their community, so let's please not sacrifice more innocent blood in the name of politeness and pretend that we don't see any differences in our multicultural societies.

32,"As an atheist and an infidel by most standards, I can be impartial on this topic.  The Christians haven't been killing their version of infidels for quite some time.

I don't worry about Christians doing me physical harm (cheating me in business is another matter*), but I wouldn't trust a radical Muslim within rifle range.

*Never could get my head around the concept of ""forgiveness of sins.""  Seems to me to be a Get-Out-of-Hell-Free card issued by simply uttering the appropriate abbra cadabra before you die; up to that point, you can sin all you want.
