22,"ATF, thank you for these words:  

""it does make a difference that we can see someone as good as Fr. Mychal Judge was gay and also a wonderful priest, a holy man, and even a saint. Maybe even people like BXVI can learn how wrong they can be. There is a lesson to be learned in acknowledging Judge was gay.""

Yes, it makes many terribly uncomfortable to know and be reminded that Fr Mychal Judge was a gay man. It makes them uncomfortable because that fact calls into question rote learning that to be gay is to be unusually prone to - if not actually practicing -  mortal sin. So how can that be consistent with sainthood? Just as it is profoundly comforting to me to recite the prayers of my Catholic childhood, I imagine it is profoundly comforting to recite rote learning from catechism.",0,-10.729690494239058,10.729690494239058
18,"So what exactly is your issue with genders being segregated?  If that is the cultural norm, why does it bother you?  Are women being suppressed by having to pray in a separate section?

12,"Come on Fuzzy ... they built a fish processing plant for $55 million .. oh yeah ... it folded after barely a year and was sold to a church for $6 million. They built us a barley project complete with grain elevators in Valdez and Seward ... oh yeah ... the crop failed or was eaten by the bison herd, the Valdez elevator was built but never used and the Seward elevator and string of railroad cars for hauling the grain were sold for pennies without ever seeing a kernal of grain. Anyone remember how much we spent on that one? They built themselves a new LIO .... and then moved to another... oh yeah .... the lawsuit will probably add $30 million to the price tag they paid for the bank building in Spenard.

35,"The fallacious reasoning is all yours.  The homosexual lobby has pinned its politics on the notion that acting on one's homosexual urge is not really a matter of choice, but a foregone conclusion.  They have made that largely THE issue.  I was simply pointing out that, contrary to what you said choice is indeed THE issue, or at least, a main one.  To remove that question, as you seem insistent on doing, is not only illogical but a false representation of the debate between the two sides.
