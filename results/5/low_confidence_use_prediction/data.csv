9,"""common sense"" is subjective and irrelevant. The law is what counts here.

He was a child soldier under the law and was supposed to be protected as such. He wasn't protected and the government of the day not only didn't defend his rights but colluded to keep him locked up and tortured. We are lucky to be getting off with a settlement and luckier still that someone in the Canadian government isn't going to jail for war crimes over this.",0,-13.148789958653328,13.148789958653328

38,"Then CU is doing a huge disservice to their female students. I consider myself a progressive liberal but, that being disclosed, I can only imagine what group of left wing nut jobs thought a study like that was beneficial. It only obfuscates the issue. I would imagine a lot of parents are uncomfortable discussing the issue. Maybe we should have a rape awareness/prevention course in our high schools.

20,"I have to laugh at the hilarious ""who is or is not a Jew"" arguments on this forum - completely missing the point of the editorial and the issue: that this all is the result of a mangled census, when all was supposed to be well again at StatsCan once the evil Harperites were expelled.

Maybe Justin will go down to the data HQ itself and write some code to make it all better.",0,-10.78105962405679,10.78105962405679

1,"""Who is better for the country? I do not know."" This is what I know - Donald Trump is a poisonous windbag, liar, homophobe, xenophobe, racist, cheat, misogynistic freak, narcissist,
chants lies in his sleep, and behaves like a spoiled brat who needs several trips to the woodshed
to address his lying behavior and wash his bullhorn mouth out with soap- not presidential.

Of course those without a degree are the majority, whatever their color, and the Democrats have previously written them off in favor of the professional class, as documented by Thomas Frank in his recent book ""Listen Liberal"".
