We progressives will only tolerate a secular progressive curriculum!  

Adherents to conservative religions like Islam and Catholicism are not free to teach their children along their lines of faith inside the walls of a partially publicly funded school system!

They can just pull their kids out.  They are free to do that.

With so many Catholics among the current GOP congress, it is clear they remain unmoved by the bishops' statement. Their statements are not even acknowledged by these GOP leaders.

25,"As usual, Chaput has his HUHA.  Chaput and his corrupt ideology has lead the church to the historical position of being in bed politically with the most racist, misogynist and fascist elements of our politics.

John Kennedy, on the other hand, ""forged in war, and tempered by a hard and bitter peace,"" spoke to the best of our natures, called us to service as the Gospel and Beatitudes require, and set our eyes upon the horizon of the human frontier of exploration and peace.  John Kennedy understood better than most that we live in a pluralistic society that is dependent on mutual respect and human dignity.

Chaput - as we have seen repeatedly in his episcopal career - has no understanding of the human heart, and wouldn't know justice, mercy and forgiveness if it bit him in his big fat a _ _.
