28,Have you tried taking Henry to dinner or perhaps a show with drinks afterward. Not for you ofcourse but for Henry. Better yet if you provide airfare to a city of his choice for him and his family and tell him it's for an educational jaunt to see how other similar size cities regulate smoking I'm sure that would get you a face to face sit down. I mean no disrespect Sara Kay when I ask why haven't your teachers taught you how government really works?,0,-16.92652524044147,16.92652524044147

32,"I don't believe that is correct. It was a different commission that recommended this response.  From the Jesuit Magazine America: 

"" Last December Pope Francis announced that he was appointing a commission of bishops and experts under the chairmanship of the secretary for the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments (second in command), Archbishop Arthur Roche, to review “Liturgiam Authenticam.” They met sometime last winter. The motu proprio, “Magnum Principium,” issued by Pope Francis today is presumably a response to their report.""",0,-13.349886493133667,13.349886493133667

6,"I'm not sure that I understand.

To take your example, I'd say that you are taking the broad view -- you understand the reasoning that people have when taking such an approach. Agreeing with that approach is not necessary, and indeed you do disagree (as do I) so your principles have not been abandoned.

But in taking the broad view and achieving some sort of understanding, a number of important things become possible. It reduces the human tendency to regard people with whom we disagree as ""evil"" or enemies in some way, and it makes it possible to recognize common ground where otherwise it would appear that there is none. In your example, the common ground would be the goal of raising healthy children. The disagreement would only be about the method.",0,-11.176248101408287,11.176248101408287
