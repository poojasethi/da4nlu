0,"Thank you for the clarification regarding what the Mass actually is.  It is often confused with the Last Supper for many reasons, especially what was taught to us in Catholic schools, and the fact that the words of Consecration come directly from the Gospel accounts of the Passover meal of Jesus and His disciples.  Understandable mistake, don't you agree? To further understand the Mass we also, importantly, need the Easter Sunday miracle.  But I must add a note of disagreement with your statement (traditionalist as it is) of:""...the priest is not ""representing"" Jesus but instead stands in His person, presenting His sacrifice to the Father for the people.""  Vatican II was exceptionally clear that there is a second and equally vital part to that equation, and that is that the Presence of Christ occurs through the union of priest and congregation.  I am always surprised when anyone leaves that out of any discussion of the Eucharistic liturgy or its theology.  The laity need not be ""led.""",0,-17.210645349840778,17.210645349840778

36,"Oh, but I have indeed dealt with IBM employees.  My use of IBM in my comparison analogy was intended to be of limited application in a comparison not of the rate of bureaucratic movement, but of how so much of our best Church operations make use of periods of prayer and reflection in doing important Christian work. One only needs to think of the highly effective and spiritually productive work of the LCWR in dealing with the awful CDF. I accept full responsibility for not making the basis of my comparison clearer!",0,-15.322778885696795,15.322778885696795
20,"Pt. 3
The ideas in the THEOLOGY OF THE BODY come primarily from a long series of addresses given by Pope John Paul II.  As authoritative as papal pronouncements are, they do not rise to the level of conciliar teaching.  These talks presuppose an understanding of gender that cannot engage many of the experiences of ACTUAL women and men as they come to understand their own bodies.  Women theologians [and a number of men theologians] are talking back to theologies that use biology to determine human identity.  Describing women with an overemphasis on biological and physical features leads to definitions [as we had in the past] of women with weak even negative sacramental valences.  The contingent realities of our bodies are involved in our identity, but to locate the mystery--the essence---of the human person in such structures mistakes MYSTERY for MAGIC.  The divine does saturate the human but as sacrament and not as an impersonal power.",0,-14.27826915610317,14.27826915610317

15,Football 101 - a good offensive line makes any QB and RB look a lot better.  A good offense keeps the defense off the field making them look better.

The health plan is not Cadillac, as defined by law, and the law ONLY looks at price.  In any other state, it would be no where NEAR Cadillac.
The cost of housing and the cost of health care are two things killing budgets in Alaska and not just school budgets.  It makes it hard to recruit engineers and top managers because they live a much nicer lifestyle elsewhere.",0,-11.951241187397203,11.951241187397203

8,"No. No more ""cow bells"".  

Instead, we need harder deeds done quietly by the lay, ones requiring real sacrifice, attention, anticipation of real needs.   Real deeds of quiet, effortful charity, cheerfully done for the love of God, and done with God, in chattering interior conversation with Him. 

The idea of a bully pulpit is actually a defective one, the noisy savior.

The world would have far more ""bonus odor"" (see St Paul's writing) were we to use fewer cow bells in the public square, and instead smiled more to our spouses, neighbors, and perhaps stopping over to their home in the evening to ask about their chemo therapy treatment, and whether they needed anything, after we mowed their grass without mention. 

Yes, the little things quietly done for others out of love of God.  In one sense - perhaps not fully intended by CS Lewis - mere Christianity is what we need.   No more cow bells.
