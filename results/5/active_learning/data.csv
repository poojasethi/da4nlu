I consider myself a progressive liberal but, that being disclosed, I can only imagine what group of left wing nut jobs thought a study like that was beneficial. It only obfuscates the issue. I would imagine a lot of parents are uncomfortable discussing the issue. Maybe we should have a rape awareness/prevention course in our high schools. I can't see any other elective being more important than that.",0,-13.802865429019805,13.802865429019805

He was a child soldier under the law and was supposed to be protected as such. He wasn't protected and the government of the day not only didn't defend his rights but colluded to keep him locked up and tortured.
