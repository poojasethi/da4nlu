26,I agree with Tulsi. Also a safe place/no fly zone in that part of the world for refugees would be the best solution for them and most other countries. Non-muslims could be offered a chance to relocate elsewhere if they so choose.,0,-8.404145925197739,8.404145925197739

18,"So what exactly is your issue with genders being segregated?  If that is the cultural norm, why does it bother you?  Are women being suppressed by having to pray in a separate section?  Not any more than the men who have to pray in their own separate section as well.  Sounds pretty fair and equal to me.",0,-8.289207341900038,8.289207341900038

22,"ATF, thank you for these words:  

""it does make a difference that we can see someone as good as Fr. Mychal Judge was gay and also a wonderful priest, a holy man, and even a saint. Maybe even people like BXVI can learn how wrong they can be. There is a lesson to be learned in acknowledging Judge was gay.""

Yes, it makes many terribly uncomfortable to know and be reminded that Fr Mychal Judge was a gay man. It makes them uncomfortable because that fact calls into question rote learning that to be gay is to be unusually prone to - if not actually practicing -  mortal sin. So how can that be consistent with sainthood? Just as it is profoundly comforting to me to recite the prayers of my Catholic childhood, I imagine it is profoundly comforting to recite rote learning from catechism.",0,-7.566017586406425,7.566017586406425

23,"Outstanding post!  And further, I am not lobbying local, state, or federal agencies to pass laws the support discrimination against the Church or clerics nor am I advocating for the repeal to anti-discrimination protections that protect the Church's practice of its faith.  

Until the Roman Church changes its understanding of morality from that of the natural law to one of fully integrated personhood, there will be no foundation to move forward.

7,"The only way to make peace with terrorists is to discover why they are so angry and attempt to make some kind of amends. In their minds we have wronged them so from a position of strength what can we do to make it right? I do not mean kissing their feet I mean tough talk leading to solutions. Trump as well as most western leaders do not want to have peace, they are looking for a constant state of conflict. Any smart leader knows people might be angry, and all they have to do is ask why.

35,"The fallacious reasoning is all yours.  The homosexual lobby has pinned its politics on the notion that acting on one's homosexual urge is not really a matter of choice, but a foregone conclusion.  They have made that largely THE issue.  I was simply pointing out that, contrary to what you said choice is indeed THE issue, or at least, a main one.  To remove that question, as you seem insistent on doing, is not only illogical but a false representation of the debate between the two sides.  The name of the fallacy you committed is Latin, ignoratio elenchi.",0,-0.07866980267853485,0.07866980267853485
