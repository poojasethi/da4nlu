Finally, to suggest that females lack the stamina expected of a male in behaving responsibly is misogynistic.  These observations are not predicated on facts not in evidence.",0,-7.799922580760887,7.799922580760887

Hoffman is definitely the weak link in the rotation, as he is horribly inconsistent and I am starting to believe that Senzatela would be a better choice right now. Hoffman has all the great stuff you need but you just never know what you will get with him.

37,"Let me offer an alternative slant, for all the apologists who still don't get it. It never ceases to appal me how everyone will happily comment on things they know absolutely nothing about.

Hair has always been a highly politicized issue for black women. It is only one facet of the myth of dehumanization Blacks have been fed throughhout history, where they could never be expected to measure up.

Never mind that you're too dumb for STEM or self governqnce, your cultural practices too savage, your gods barbaric....and other colonial era philosophies that defined the mental breakdown of an entire race for geberations to come.

In addition to all that, a black woman can also be expected to deal with a constant barrage of implied and explicit commentary that suggests her skin is too dark, her lips too full, her bum too fat (that is until collagenized lips à la Jolie and  filled glutes à la Kardashian turned ""fat"" into ""phat"".
