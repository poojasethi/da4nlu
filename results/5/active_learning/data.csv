It is not good for Canada at all. according to my point of view, the principle reason is private segment is not taking dynamic part to make relations with different nations or as such, they are not extending their business, they are simply juggling with the possess thoughts inside the nation. There is a need to burn through cash on research and how they can manage others nations as far as business. Organizations ought to build up their own thoughts rather getting it from other nation.The organization ought to in addition be nearly prepared for spending enough cash on Creative work with the target that Canada can in like way have their own particular improvement and considerations to collaborate.

12,"Too funny.

No little fella, it is not.

A 22 fold increase over 40 years equates to an approximately 8% growth rate.

A six fold increase over 20 years equates to a greater than 9% annual growth rate.

You sure are clever. By the way, the obvious flaw in your arithmetic comparison  is so obvious, a smart 4th grader should be able to figure it out. I'll leave it as a little puzzle for you. Genius.

Regardless for the record, even with a drop in the annual increase of the Muslim population to 7%, in 60 years that translates to approximately 60 million people. Let's take 2/3 of that and say 45 million.

As I stated, and as is exactly true, without a change in demographic trends, and unless muslims in Canada suddenly catch this secularism trend you're all excited about, Canadians will be regularly hearing the call of the muezzin within 60 years.",0,-6.720211428351414,6.720211428351414

No law abiding, responsible Muslim citizen wants their children involved with these insidious terrorist groups; no more than white parents want their kids in neo-Nazi gangs, or black parents want their kids hanging around with the Bloods and Crips. Let Muslims help by speaking out and identifying these radical elements within their community, so let's please not sacrifice more innocent blood in the name of politeness and pretend that we don't see any differences in our multicultural societies.

Don't confuse test results with kids being educated and respectful. Look at how many college students who probably got boffo test scores think the 1A shouldn't apply to hate speech or, really, anything they disagree with, & think violence is fine.

Cherrypicking Texas to claim US schools are being controlled by Republican/conservative education ideology is really absurd. Your characterization of it is also wrong. https://www.texastribune.org/2017/04/19/texas-education-board-evolution-standards-/

Any problems in schools are due to Democrats & organized labor? I never said any such thing.  I did point out that they have been dominant in education for decades. I said that arguing for them to continue dominance so we can have ""educated voters who understand each other"" is a silly argument, in view of what we are seeing on college campuses as the product of current education.

You're in the business of telling others what ""they should have to show"" for themselves after x amount of years of employment?  A successful society is NOT one ""where the majority enjoy the same benefits and wages."" That is absolute garbage, and I want you to tell us all who told you that.  A successful society is one where the barriers to opportunity are taken away, so everyone has the same OPPORTUNITY-- NOT the same OUTCOME.  You are what's wrong with our country.
