With so many Catholics among the current GOP congress, it is clear they remain unmoved by the bishops' statement. Their statements are not even acknowledged by these GOP leaders.

John Kennedy, on the other hand, ""forged in war, and tempered by a hard and bitter peace,"" spoke to the best of our natures, called us to service as the Gospel and Beatitudes require, and set our eyes upon the horizon of the human frontier of exploration and peace.  John Kennedy understood better than most that we live in a pluralistic society that is dependent on mutual respect and human dignity.
