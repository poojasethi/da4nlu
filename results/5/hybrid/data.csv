Yes we have a tourist train that plies the Rockies but you can't use that to get to Vancouver unless you have a few grand and a week. And it doesn't even go to Edmonton, so there's that.",0,-16.506205321503458,16.506205321503458
42,"What an awful analogy, shallow.

At Mass, we become present at our redemption. It's a grand act of reconciliation, making marital intercourse seem a bit superficial. It's the greatest act of love we can take part in, bar none.

Reese has a mere temporal or surface understanding of the Mass, and it shows.

Software?

I develop software for a living, and updating software is no Mass.

31,"Yes, I am against a woman having an abortion after being impregnated during a rape. What I am for is gently supporting that woman through the pregnancy and helping her find a loving family who will raise the child if it is too difficult for her to do so. Why would anyone sentence a child to death for being a victim of a crime? No one says doing the right thing is easy. I had the pleasure of listening to a speaker who was the product of a rape. She says the greatest gift her mother gave her is life. She was adopted by a loving family, and she spends a great deal of her time speaking against abortion. Once again...making right choices is not necessarily easy, but it is essential to the right of everyone to have a chance at life.

A note to those who may have already had one or more abortions. Do not worry...if you are truly sorry and ask for forgiveness, God forgives you. You have one or more children waiting for you in heaven, and you may be the one God is looking for to help save life.",0,-13.298329515535325,13.298329515535325

13,"Alexandra, 
The question of engagement that you raise is a god one, for it affects the church at every level.  When we look at the early church, we see a level of engagement that is seemingly unthinkable today.  

There are parishes in the church that are still very much alive, and vibrant.  I love that.  But I can't help but get the sense that such places are more and more becoming the aberration rather than the norm.

I'm sure there are tons of factors at play in all of this, but at the end of the day, the church leadership's handling of the scandal doesn't help.  When this commission was formed there was a wave of hope that ran through the church.  That's important to recognize, as it reflects the hearts of so many who still want to believe in the church.  By essentially sidetracking the commission, I think Francis has confirmed the fears of so many, while enabling so many of these clericalist priests to do their thing.  It all seems to perpetuate a cycle...",0,-12.066131196438736,12.066131196438736

I'm sure there would be plenty of non-profit organizations that would provide the pills for little or no cost for women who cannot afford them. Deregulation is the only option that both empowers women to make their own contraceptive choices and affirms religious liberty.  Instead, one silly regulation leads to a constitutional crisis.

The homosexual lobby has pinned its politics on the notion that acting on one's homosexual urge is not really a matter of choice, but a foregone conclusion.  They have made that largely THE issue.  I was simply pointing out that, contrary to what you said choice is indeed THE issue, or at least, a main one.  To remove that question, as you seem insistent on doing, is not only illogical but a false representation of the debate between the two sides.
