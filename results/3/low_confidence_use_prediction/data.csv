22,"There's a world of difference between sexual content, even vulgar sexual content, and sexual assault. I may or may not enjoy a movie with graphic sexual content, but I find nothing harmless in sexual assault, which is what Donald Trump has been accused of and admitted. Consent matters. I believe the main characters in the fictional Fifty Shades of Grey engaged in consensual activities, which makes the book and movie irrelevant to any discussion of Mr. Trump's habit of sexually assaulting women.

Here we have a  editor for a newspaper that excels in tabloid headlines,reporters under the impression that their opinions are more important than true and accurate facts. They are enthusiastic about publishing hate mail of all kinds as long as it matches their perverted mind set. But it does accomplish one thing with their tabloid headlines and biased reporting. It exposures the lie of the good American,the tolerant American, the America where every citizen can express themselves without fear of reprisal. Vote how they choose, choose a religion without fear of being killed because of their choice. What this election will/is showing is a America divided among 2 candidates one a sociopath and the other an immoral cheat,liar and probably a traitor. So much for the land of the free home of the brave. The ugly American is a better description of the people supporting either candidate.
