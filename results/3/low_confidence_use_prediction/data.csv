34,"What a joke.
Sometime back the RG changed its format for comments to civil comments because as one RG employee noted the atmosphere was toxic. 
Well if you want to make rude baseless comments, practice unsupported finger pointing and 3rd grade name calling while hiding behind the teacher you need go no further than the letters to the editor page of the RG.
From the foul comments posted by m loew and a stack of similar trash published by the editors of the RG in last week or so looks to be an effort by RG editors to promote as much division in this community as possible.
Think it is time to call home land security on the RG editors to look into their efforts to create hate and unrest in this community. For every letter calling for understanding the RG publishers 3-4 hate letters.
Of course they will deny this, but what do you expect from a tabloid. 
I hope the first person hurt by some of these people will take a close look at the RG.

Nor however many simply never were reported. This number is in excess of all other sources of terror in this county...COMBINED.

So, the G & M is helping us, you see -- teaching us how to be good 'White People' -- Smiling, guilty & undeserving of Human Respect..

26,"It is the hierarchist impulse that would rather have a perfect moral code than one that makes it easier to live life as a human being in the world today. The perfection of the Father was not perfect holiness, but perfect love. That should be our ideal. It is one we will never reach without the help of God. Perfect conduct is easy. Perfect love requires Christ. He is gentle and humble of heart. This is how we must be with our fellows. We must guide them to be fulfilled human, not angels, especially in sex.

Asexuality is one of many orientations in humanity. Those who are born to follow this path should not assume that the rest of us share these feelings. We will accept your non-attraction if you accept that yours is not the only path to holiness We won't even suggest reparative therapy for you. Just realize you did not chose asexuality, it chose you.

37,"Trumpism is a direct result of propaganda from the right.  Fox, Breitbart, Rush Windbag, Alex Jones are entertainers who make millions off the ill-informed.  We have 33% of the population who invest at least 6 hrs per day in front of their TV's.  The folks who own this media know how to sell advertising.  Let's face it, Fox's personalities are a lot more entertaining than Wolf Blitzer.  It's not about facts or reality, it's about alternate truths and escaping reality, via TV. Tech innovation and automation took their jobs, being a victim is easier than job retraining. Strip mining uses less people than underground, coal jobs are not coming back to WV or KY, neither is Ike's or Reagan's GOP. Propaganda has de-legitimized the media, the law, the process of governance and alternate views of governance, ie: Democrats are always referred to as ""tax and spend liberals"".
