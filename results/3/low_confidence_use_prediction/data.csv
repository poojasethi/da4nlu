8,"My home insurance has more than doubled in ten years.   It has tripled in 15 years and coverage has gone down.  Food is up dramatically if you don't buy processed food -- far more than 20% since 2007.   Utilities are up.   

Electronics are cheaper.   Some clothing is about the same or slightly more expensive, but shoes are definitely up.

I was in a camping store the other day and was shocked at the prices of things that I haven't bought in 15 years.   The same quality of item was 4x the price.

There is variation, however, I find it hard to believe that the real rate of inflation for a basket of essential and well-produced goods and healthy food is less than 4 or 5% per annum over the past 15 years.   And that's before we start discussing real estate.

26,"The majority of scientist once believed in alchemy, most believed in the Piltdown Man fraud for four decades. When J. Harlan Bretz first suggested that the scablands of Eastern Washington State were created by a massive flood the narrow minded scientific community accused him of being a zealot peddling a flood legend. Bretz was actually not making any theological argument.

The notion that scientists arenâ€™t as susceptible to financial self interests, prejudices, biases and mass grouptink as other professions, is utter nonsense.

It contains a number of insightful moments as pertains to our current stalemate as a society in general, and in the government we have elected.  Our paralysis is of our own doing and only we can undo it.  

I dislike both Hillary and Donald immensely.  I can only hope that we emerge from the next four years with better options.  We, the people, however, are not so much different from each other regardless of ethnicity, religious beliefs, sexual orientation or whatever else you might want to use to divide us.
