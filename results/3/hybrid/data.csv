On this topic, the ""Train Has Long Since Left the Platform"".  The decision my Council Chair to bypass this election cycle and complete his last term, unless the city charter amendment permits him one last term, gave the field open for the top three contenders.  What the Council contributed in getting the Affordable Housing, and cooperation with State's Homelessness Czar, in getting tangible shelters and services on the ground and pending completion, we would still be in the study and task force mode.

39,"Barely a week after the inauguration and we are hearing buyers remorse across the land. If you think you and your family are safe....think again. In addition to building the famous wall he has done a good job of alienating Mexico, our third largest trading partner. That means they will not be eager to buy our goods nor will we be able to buy from them if they sell to other markets. His brainstorm of a 20% tax on goods from Mexico will give us the wall but it comes from your wallet.
The sanctuary cities might be forever in the courts as his powers cannot reach directly to the mayors to order compliance.
Now you can continue to fear our chummy relationship with Russia as he will chat with Putin on his unsecured line about deals they can arrange. Putin will be sure to clean his clock. 
Keep in mind though that our biggest problem is his purported low turnout for the inauguration, his Time  magazine covers and those Latino unregistered cheaters who only voted for Hillary Clinton. OY VEY!",0,-21.074269640986685,21.074269640986685

1,"From the article: ""The researchers defined immigrants as those with permanent residency or those born to a mother with permanent residency status."" Interesting that a child born to a father who has permanent residency status is not considered an immigrant, unless the mother also happens to be a permanent resident.  Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, who murdered a Canadian soldier before storming Parliament Hill in Oct. 2014, was the son of an immigrant and a Canadian so he would not be considered an immigrant by this definition. Similarly, Marc Lepine (born Gamil Rodrigue Liass Gharbi), who murdered 14 women at the  École Polytechnique in Montreal in 1989, was the son of an immigrant and a Canadian.",0,-18.59429520488643,18.59429520488643

4,"I am an ETFO member. We need to be advocating for more than just more supports, though. We need to bring back specialized classes for high needs students. The all-inclusive model does not work.  It's politically incorrect to say that, but it's the truth.  The special needs child does not get what he/she needs in the current model, and the rest of the class suffers. Not only are children with very special needs being placed in regular classes because of lack of money/lack of caring(?), children with major mental health issues and severe behaviour problems are in our classes.  If the public came into a classroom for a week, people would be shocked. Because I have 3 violent children in my class, I am in a constant state of alert to ensure the safety and mental well-being of the other students (and me) in my class. I also have 2 developmentally delayed students, a non-verbal very autistic student, 2 new refugees who don't speak English, and a split class.

Scripture, the early fathers and even the CCC all stress the need to develop a strong interior life and yet some people seem petrified to venture down this path.
