40,"Why the continued ""gloom and doom"" and darkness theme in so many NCR articles?  Rarely a day goes by without some author jotting out a too hastily written article on some gloom topic...darkness, pain, abuse, oppression,  disaster, shadows, crisis, angst, anguish, bad memories, did I say pain already?

It's easy to write about gloominess. 

The Christian message is one of hope, liveliness, intimacy with God, growth, positiveness, cheerfulness, beginning again, energy, beauty, goodness, reconciliation, work, solving problems for others, vitality, resiliency.

Not getting any of that in the ""naitsirhC"" message of NCR.",0,-15.043363205748992,15.043363205748992

Internet in this area at that time was Satellite only. Supply boat once a week in summer, once a fortnight in winter. Satellite TV only. Sarah worked on a horticultural block here, and became respected both as a hard worker, and as a good community member. I would suggest she is better equipped to handle the ""real trials"" you are fearing than most.

24,"Those with kids in the schools are seeing the true damage the PERS debacle is presently doing. To many it is some theoretical problem. It is ironic that those who supposedly ""helped"" kids are now the ones robbing them and their education. Enjoy the next 30 or 40 years of welfare on the backs of kids and families.  At least you are spending your welfare check in the area and not moving to Mexico to live our your life as an overseas pensioner as many of the local public employees are doing.",0,-8.709243470435378,8.709243470435378

Here we have a  editor for a newspaper that excels in tabloid headlines,reporters under the impression that their opinions are more important than true and accurate facts. They are enthusiastic about publishing hate mail of all kinds as long as it matches their perverted mind set. But it does accomplish one thing with their tabloid headlines and biased reporting. It exposures the lie of the good American,the tolerant American, the America where every citizen can express themselves without fear of reprisal. Vote how they choose, choose a religion without fear of being killed because of their choice. What this election will/is showing is a America divided among 2 candidates one a sociopath and the other an immoral cheat,liar and probably a traitor. So much for the land of the free home of the brave. The ugly American is a better description of the people supporting either candidate.
