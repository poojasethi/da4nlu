In no Muslim majority society is there a noteworthy Christian-Muslim dialogue going on.

Looked like there were more, but maybe you were “rehabilitated”. Anyway, not important.

43,"""...by writing letters o their senators....""

Party honesty is party expediency (in both political parties). No senator or Congressperson is going to attack a bishop or the CC, especially in our current political climate where political power is divided to conceal political responsibility (to take care of the poor and uninsured Americans, among other constituencies). And since most white Catholics voted for Trump and most non-white Catholics voted for Clinton, what part of a divided ""church"" constituency (including bishops) is a Democratic or Republican politician supposed to ""attack"" and not to fall with the least political damage done to his/her party? The UK and Australian commissions worked because those appointed delegations were (and still are) investigating all institutions (with all political parties on board), among other things.

Ah, no. 

I want to serve only with people who can look at reality and make sound and clear headed judgments under great stress, noise, amid great violence of action, physical and mental demands, such as:  

- This man in my sights is carrying and is now shouldering a weapon > I need to put him down. 

- This supposed civilian is exhibiting hostile intent > I need to raise the posture of my weapon, and body. 

- This woman's story doesn't hang together > search the house.

 When supposed RCs start foaming at the mouth against good Pope Francis, you know he's doing the right thing.

Harlan Bretz first suggested that the scablands of Eastern Washington State were created by a massive flood the narrow minded scientific community accused him of being a zealot peddling a flood legend. Bretz was actually not making any theological argument.

The notion that scientists aren’t as susceptible to financial self interests, prejudices, biases and mass grouptink as other professions, is utter nonsense.
