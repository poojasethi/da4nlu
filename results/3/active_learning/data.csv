17,"No, what it means is that these appear to be exaggerations.  If they were truly as bad as they are being depicted, the school districts reporting practices are wanting.  If you objectively look at the document and take the time to absorb all of it, a light might go on over your head.  Why would people keep track of a bunch of nit picky situations, and chronicle them, unless they were trying to oust their supervisor.  Even the events in which she did not respond to the requests of others, do not tell the true story.  I have worked around extremely emotionally disturbed kids.  Inexperienced staff escalate their responses too quickly.  Experienced staff take minor incidents in stride and deal with the big picture.  Sometimes, people have to learn to handle things by themselves.  The staff who said that Ms. Lange told them or others to do something which they balked at, could be considered insubordinate.  My perspective is one who spent 35-years in health care management and PR.",0,-12.492635810897205,12.492635810897205

27,"Yes - 

But the question must also be asked - why the desire to canonize Fr. Mychal as a ""gay"" Saint?  

Whether he was or wasn't is really of no consequence at all.  He lived a life of loving charity to the point of losing his own life.  And let us not forget there has never been any indication he was anything other than a continent, celibate, chaste priest.  

If those insisting on labeling Fr. Mychal as a homosexual are using that to indicate that lgbt persons can live holy, charitable, loving lives - fine.  But the suspicion is that he is being used to justify a ""lifestyle"" and ssm, conflating homosexuality with homosexual acts.  That is not fair, accurate, or honest...and has to be addressed.",0,-10.741813330446199,10.741813330446199

8,"My home insurance has more than doubled in ten years.   It has tripled in 15 years and coverage has gone down.  Food is up dramatically if you don't buy processed food -- far more than 20% since 2007.   Utilities are up.   

Electronics are cheaper.   Some clothing is about the same or slightly more expensive, but shoes are definitely up.

I was in a camping store the other day and was shocked at the prices of things that I haven't bought in 15 years.   The same quality of item was 4x the price.

There is variation, however, I find it hard to believe that the real rate of inflation for a basket of essential and well-produced goods and healthy food is less than 4 or 5% per annum over the past 15 years.   And that's before we start discussing real estate.

26,"The majority of scientist once believed in alchemy, most believed in the Piltdown Man fraud for four decades. When J. Harlan Bretz first suggested that the scablands of Eastern Washington State were created by a massive flood the narrow minded scientific community accused him of being a zealot peddling a flood legend. Bretz was actually not making any theological argument.

The notion that scientists arenâ€™t as susceptible to financial self interests, prejudices, biases and mass grouptink as other professions, is utter nonsense.
