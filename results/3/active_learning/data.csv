44,"So, by your argument, we should be ramping back Sikhs because they have far more MPs, MPPs and MLAs than their population in Canada warrants, and similarly ramping back Chinese-Canadians in Chemistry, Math and Medicine, because they are heavily over represented in those fields in preference to the humanities? How about ramping back women in Psychology, Sociology, Fine Arts, Education, Nutrition or any of the other university fields they predominate?  How about university as a whole? Should we be concerned about 62% of our university graduates being women when they are 51% of our population?

Comparing against hard percentages of the general population is asinine.  You have to compare against the APPLICATION RATE.  There's 7-8 men who come forward to be a candidate in every riding for every woman. They don't apply for the job in a hard 51/49 ratio like they exist in the population, so there's a darn good reason there's more men in political power than women.",0,-7.38585480803269,7.38585480803269

38,"What's your problem with naked pictures. I thought liberals were all about free expression and such. Obama was a coke head for a time and you are cool with that. Bill Cinton and his cigar was okay with the feminists. 
You are sounding like the frumpy old judgmental type that liberals constantly accuse people on the right of being. Face it, the left with their PC tyranny are the new Puritans in America.",0,-6.462398112005085,6.462398112005085

22,"There's a world of difference between sexual content, even vulgar sexual content, and sexual assault. I may or may not enjoy a movie with graphic sexual content, but I find nothing harmless in sexual assault, which is what Donald Trump has been accused of and admitted. Consent matters. I believe the main characters in the fictional Fifty Shades of Grey engaged in consensual activities, which makes the book and movie irrelevant to any discussion of Mr. Trump's habit of sexually assaulting women.

0,"If this ed piece wasn't so pathetic it would be funny. Here we have a  editor for a newspaper that excels in tabloid headlines,reporters under the impression that their opinions are more important than true and accurate facts. They are enthusiastic about publishing hate mail of all kinds as long as it matches their perverted mind set. But it does accomplish one thing with their tabloid headlines and biased reporting. It exposures the lie of the good American,the tolerant American, the America where every citizen can express themselves without fear of reprisal. Vote how they choose, choose a religion without fear of being killed because of their choice. What this election will/is showing is a America divided among 2 candidates one a sociopath and the other an immoral cheat,liar and probably a traitor. So much for the land of the free home of the brave. The ugly American is a better description of the people supporting either candidate.
