41,"Please don't put words in peoples' mouths.  The main point is NOT money.  The main point is providing appropiate support and treatment for the mentally ill.  You need funding to accomplish this.  When the DHS is wasting tens of millions on the JC Hospital when all patients could be transferred to the open beds at the Salem State Hospital, that funding for the needed community-level support systems is not available.  No one I've read is advocating for the ""cutting"" of services to the mentally ill.  In fact, E.S., like me and several others, is advocating for cost-effective measures which will serve to expand the provision of support and treatment for the mentally ill.  May I offer, again, to sit down with you anytime, anywhere to discuss this issue.  Give me a call if you're interested.  Gary Crum Junction City",0,-9.447836168186564,9.447836168186564

10,"You have bought in to the belief that China can or will change NKs behavior.  That is a fallacy.  NK looks at the last two countries that abandoned their WMD programs, Libya and Iraq, and sees two regimes, lead by a dictator, who were toppled by the west after giving up their WMDs.  For NK the WMDs are the insurance policy against regime change.  The NK WMDs are not going anywhere until the west can provide the assurances and actions that will placate the NKs that the west will not move against NK after it disarms.  China will not move against NK or pressure NK unless such assurances are in place.  It sees the same history as NK and it prefers the current regime rather that a failed state sending refugees to China or worse yet, a Korea unified under govt in Seoul, on their border.  Trump is trying o outsource the NK problem to China who has no reason to pressure NK.  He is putting himself in a corner, attack NK, or look ""weak"" by negotiating directly with NK.",0,-8.154270234326743,8.154270234326743

May bleeding piles distress him

May crabs the size of taxicabs

And breaks his stinking neck",1,-6.038735116535788,6.038735116535788
