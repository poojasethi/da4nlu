40,"Why the continued ""gloom and doom"" and darkness theme in so many NCR articles?  Rarely a day goes by without some author jotting out a too hastily written article on some gloom topic...darkness, pain, abuse, oppression,  disaster, shadows, crisis, angst, anguish, bad memories, did I say pain already?

It's easy to write about gloominess. 

The Christian message is one of hope, liveliness, intimacy with God, growth, positiveness, cheerfulness, beginning again, energy, beauty, goodness, reconciliation, work, solving problems for others, vitality, resiliency.

Internet in this area at that time was Satellite only. Supply boat once a week in summer, once a fortnight in winter. Satellite TV only. Sarah worked on a horticultural block here, and became respected both as a hard worker, and as a good community member.

21,"The root of the human rights and terrorism problems is not the Quran or Islam, per se. It is the dominance of conservative Arabic culture, much of which is brutally vengeful, sexist, racist and regressive.

Will non-arab muslims ever demand major islamic reforms to unequivocally disentagle their peoples' faith from Arabic hegemony? Until then, Islam will be mistrusted by the rest of the world, and rightly so.

Christians had to do this 500 years ago, and the result was the Reformation and the flourishing of Europe.

Many JWs like you're doing right here try to minimize the mistakes made by the Watchtower Society, as did I for many years. At least the ones I did know about. But you just can't get away with this that easy. How many people DIED solely due to those bad medical policies which eventually had to be dropped altogether? That's how bad they were, most had to be dropped, discarded, dumped because they were just that bad. Was God behind them? Did God say No Vaccinations for 23 years and then change his mind and say vaccinations are now okay to have? All the while vaccinations were stomping out polio, smallpox and so much more.
