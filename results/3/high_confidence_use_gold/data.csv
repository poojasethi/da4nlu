43,"""...by writing letters o their senators....""

Party honesty is party expediency (in both political parties). No senator or Congressperson is going to attack a bishop or the CC, especially in our current political climate where political power is divided to conceal political responsibility (to take care of the poor and uninsured Americans, among other constituencies). And since most white Catholics voted for Trump and most non-white Catholics voted for Clinton, what part of a divided ""church"" constituency (including bishops) is a Democratic or Republican politician supposed to ""attack"" and not to fall with the least political damage done to his/her party? The UK and Australian commissions worked because those appointed delegations were (and still are) investigating all institutions (with all political parties on board), among other things.  We are a long ways off from that.",0,-7.9061775081702015,7.9061775081702015

Looked like there were more, but maybe you were “rehabilitated”. Anyway, not important.

 When supposed RCs start foaming at the mouth against good Pope Francis, you know he's doing the right thing.  Only a truly ecumenical council reflecting the thoughts  views of the ancient Christian communities can attach the label of ""heretic"" on any pope and depose him.

- This supposed civilian is exhibiting hostile intent > I need to raise the posture of my weapon, and body.

If you objectively look at the document and take the time to absorb all of it, a light might go on over your head.  Why would people keep track of a bunch of nit picky situations, and chronicle them, unless they were trying to oust their supervisor.  Even the events in which she did not respond to the requests of others, do not tell the true story.  I have worked around extremely emotionally disturbed kids.  Inexperienced staff escalate their responses too quickly.  Experienced staff take minor incidents in stride and deal with the big picture.  Sometimes, people have to learn to handle things by themselves.  The staff who said that Ms. Lange told them or others to do something which they balked at, could be considered insubordinate.
