17,"Let's drive all the jobs to China and India where they open a new coal-fired power plant each week, with NO pollution controls; and we still get the pollution from across the Pacific. And all this to stop .1 degree of warming. Insane, here we can invent, and implement pollution controls using the profit of a strong economy.

39,"Barely a week after the inauguration and we are hearing buyers remorse across the land. If you think you and your family are safe....think again. In addition to building the famous wall he has done a good job of alienating Mexico, our third largest trading partner. That means they will not be eager to buy our goods nor will we be able to buy from them if they sell to other markets. His brainstorm of a 20% tax on goods from Mexico will give us the wall but it comes from your wallet.
The sanctuary cities might be forever in the courts as his powers cannot reach directly to the mayors to order compliance.
Now you can continue to fear our chummy relationship with Russia as he will chat with Putin on his unsecured line about deals they can arrange. Putin will be sure to clean his clock. 
Keep in mind though that our biggest problem is his purported low turnout for the inauguration, his Time  magazine covers and those Latino unregistered cheaters who only voted for Hillary Clinton. OY VEY!",0,-16.058968811887112,16.058968811887112
23,"Based on what Mayor Kirk Caldwell and Gov. David Ige have started and accomplished in 2015, their credibility have improved.  Time for discussions and study have long since past.  On this topic, the ""Train Has Long Since Left the Platform"".  The decision my Council Chair to bypass this election cycle and complete his last term, unless the city charter amendment permits him one last term, gave the field open for the top three contenders.  What the Council contributed in getting the Affordable Housing, and cooperation with State's Homelessness Czar, in getting tangible shelters and services on the ground and pending completion, we would still be in the study and task force mode.

1,"From the article: ""The researchers defined immigrants as those with permanent residency or those born to a mother with permanent residency status."" Interesting that a child born to a father who has permanent residency status is not considered an immigrant, unless the mother also happens to be a permanent resident.  Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, who murdered a Canadian soldier before storming Parliament Hill in Oct. 2014, was the son of an immigrant and a Canadian so he would not be considered an immigrant by this definition. Similarly, Marc Lepine (born Gamil Rodrigue Liass Gharbi), who murdered 14 women at the  École Polytechnique in Montreal in 1989, was the son of an immigrant and a Canadian.",0,-14.388928351906726,14.388928351906726

4,"I am an ETFO member. We need to be advocating for more than just more supports, though. We need to bring back specialized classes for high needs students. The all-inclusive model does not work.  It's politically incorrect to say that, but it's the truth.  The special needs child does not get what he/she needs in the current model, and the rest of the class suffers. Not only are children with very special needs being placed in regular classes because of lack of money/lack of caring(?), children with major mental health issues and severe behaviour problems are in our classes.  If the public came into a classroom for a week, people would be shocked. Because I have 3 violent children in my class, I am in a constant state of alert to ensure the safety and mental well-being of the other students (and me) in my class. I also have 2 developmentally delayed students, a non-verbal very autistic student, 2 new refugees who don't speak English, and a split class.

14,"I too am so baffled by those who look to ""others"" for concrete answers in life.  Scripture, the early fathers and even the CCC all stress the need to develop a strong interior life and yet some people seem petrified to venture down this path.  I have to say that those who refuse to extend ""trust"" in one's ability to rely upon their prayerfully formed consciences may need to examine the very basis of their own faith formation... said another way:  superficial, checkbox theology does not a disciple of Jesus make!",0,-11.827775051342227,11.827775051342227

33,These protests were about the imposition of Sharia Law in America.  First these laws are imposed in small areas within the United States. Eventually they become the law of the land such as we saw with the Taliban in Iraq and Afghanistan and ISIS throughout the Middle East.

42,"I think Dr. Caulfield understands the issue pretty well. No medicine or vaccine works perfectly on everyone, but clinical trial evidence and eventually real-world evidence paint a convincing picture. Not every physician, naturopath, nurse, pharmacist or psychologist is professionally excellent but fortunately most can be trusted. Still, there are outliers in science and in life and they should be recognized for what they are.
