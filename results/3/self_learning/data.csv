10,"Any learning is good, including learning about other faiths a and religions. However, there are a few important point to keep in mind when learning about Islam or engaging in Christian-Muslim dialogue. 

In no Muslim majority society is there a noteworthy Christian-Muslim dialogue going on. 

At the beginning or in the early stages of any Christian-Muslim dialogue there should be an open, respectful and frank discussion about the concept a  'Takiya' and how it might impact the unfolding of the dialogue.",0,-13.211310040404657,13.211310040404657

43,"""...by writing letters o their senators....""

Party honesty is party expediency (in both political parties). No senator or Congressperson is going to attack a bishop or the CC, especially in our current political climate where political power is divided to conceal political responsibility (to take care of the poor and uninsured Americans, among other constituencies). And since most white Catholics voted for Trump and most non-white Catholics voted for Clinton, what part of a divided ""church"" constituency (including bishops) is a Democratic or Republican politician supposed to ""attack"" and not to fall with the least political damage done to his/her party? The UK and Australian commissions worked because those appointed delegations were (and still are) investigating all institutions (with all political parties on board), among other things.  We are a long ways off from that.",0,-12.246756233110744,12.246756233110744

Looked like there were more, but maybe you were “rehabilitated”. Anyway, not important. 

Not here to debate Christian history, so I will defer to the History Channel:

""The Crusades were a series of religious wars between Christians and Muslims started primarily to secure control of holy sites considered sacred by both groups. ""

 When supposed RCs start foaming at the mouth against good Pope Francis, you know he's doing the right thing.  Only a truly ecumenical council reflecting the thoughts  views of the ancient Christian communities can attach the label of ""heretic"" on any pope and depose him. These wacko and pseudo RCs who give lip service to papal infallibility, are in effect admitting such a dogma is fallacious.",0,-11.18881687416017,11.18881687416017

Ah, no. 

I want to serve only with people who can look at reality and make sound and clear headed judgments under great stress, noise, amid great violence of action, physical and mental demands, such as:  

- This man in my sights is carrying and is now shouldering a weapon > I need to put him down. 

- This supposed civilian is exhibiting hostile intent > I need to raise the posture of my weapon, and body. 

- This woman's story doesn't hang together > search the house. 

- My assaultman looks dazed and disoriented and I judge him to be combat ineffective at this time, even though he tells me he feels fine.

- My ammo is really really running low, even though I want reality to be different.

17,"No, what it means is that these appear to be exaggerations.  If they were truly as bad as they are being depicted, the school districts reporting practices are wanting.  If you objectively look at the document and take the time to absorb all of it, a light might go on over your head.  Why would people keep track of a bunch of nit picky situations, and chronicle them, unless they were trying to oust their supervisor.  Even the events in which she did not respond to the requests of others, do not tell the true story.  I have worked around extremely emotionally disturbed kids.  Inexperienced staff escalate their responses too quickly.  Experienced staff take minor incidents in stride and deal with the big picture.  Sometimes, people have to learn to handle things by themselves.  The staff who said that Ms. Lange told them or others to do something which they balked at, could be considered insubordinate.
