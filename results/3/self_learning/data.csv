44,"No. They need to expand. With 3 million more people in Colorado in the next twenty to thirty years, the reasonable thing to do is extend it and improve the roads. And a parallel highway east of I-25 needs to be built between Colorado Springs and Cheyenne. No toll roads. Most of the money needs to come from the federal government as part of a infrastructure plan. Think fifty years into the future as well as now on how to do maintenance. And plan on having the self driving car twenty years from now. What is costing society right now is not treating health care as a monopoly. And let the affluent buy supplemental coverage plans if they are willing to pay for them. The same applies to old people. After age 75, restrictions should be placed to limit government liability and to let people die natural deaths. Expensive surgeries on old people are a waste. Do not resuscitate should be standard for those collecting social security with a opt out. It is draining all the money from other needs.",0,-18.719787960433063,18.719787960433063
40,"I like it.  Not necessarily a meritocracy, but at least  it would reward individual effort and ensure that effort to improve oneself is linked to the franchise; hopefully resulting in a more educated electorate.    It has an element of Heinleins' ""Starship Troopers"" requirement to do something for the society (military service) as well.  I think other social service could be an alternative to that military service.   

I've often wondered about the Mormons and their requirement for a 2 year 'Mission' as well as helping those who fall on hard times without compensation, their requirement for stockpiling in case of an emergency and lack of compensation for their 'ministers'  and thought those things  might result in a broader social cohesion as a group

33,"""Of my friends whose parents taught the faith according to the catechism, the vast majority have stayed.""

You speak to the veritable power of religious indoctrination... nothing more.  I have witnessed this firsthand myself.

28,"Although in common usage particularly of religious people you are correct, Faithful Catholic.  Scientific definition begs to differ.  When a fetus is born and able to survive on its own, it is a child.  No one knows when personhood and ensoulment takes place.  For instance even the introduction of a sperm into an evacuated ovum that is then stimulated can cause a fetus that could grow and develop all  the way to term. So please understand that to say you Know too much about what is happening means that you know the Mind of our Great God.  No finite person can know that much information.  Scientifically, it takes birth for there to be a baby.  Therefore intrauterine life is referred to as a fetus.  Perhaps if the fetus survives past 22 weeks gestation, it could be termed a baby as it might be able to survive at 22 weeks in the best of neonatal ICU's the are seldom present anywhere other than in major universities.",0,-13.002662875230005,13.002662875230005

One thing missing from story:  In her complaint to the police, mother of the victim had alleged that her child was sexually assaulted by Mr Figarez in a church complex between January and March in 2015, mostly when she came for confession.

24,"That is the folk-tale which propagated for some years, because dissident consultors on the Pontifical Commission assisting the study of this issue selectively leaked documents while others dutifully stayed quiet allowing Paul VI to have the final say.  But now more information has come to light--see, for example, the archive made public by Germain Grisez at http://twotlj.org/BCCommission.html --and historians and fair observers alike can say that the folk-tale is false.

In some way it doesn't matter, as the case for HV is more solid than it was back then.  That's what happens when predictions come true--and when advances in science make concrete what was only known vaguely at the time.  The post-Vatican II strengthening of moral theology and return to relevance of Catholic philosophers also helps.  But history does matter in some ways, and we now know that what dissidents have been telling themselves and us about the history of HV is simply incorrect and indefensible.",0,-10.313054711914548,10.313054711914548
