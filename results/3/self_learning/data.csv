40,"Why the continued ""gloom and doom"" and darkness theme in so many NCR articles?  Rarely a day goes by without some author jotting out a too hastily written article on some gloom topic...darkness, pain, abuse, oppression,  disaster, shadows, crisis, angst, anguish, bad memories, did I say pain already?

It's easy to write about gloominess. 

The Christian message is one of hope, liveliness, intimacy with God, growth, positiveness, cheerfulness, beginning again, energy, beauty, goodness, reconciliation, work, solving problems for others, vitality, resiliency.

Not getting any of that in the ""naitsirhC"" message of NCR.",0,-16.869080401202012,16.869080401202012

Many JWs like you're doing right here try to minimize the mistakes made by the Watchtower Society, as did I for many years. At least the ones I did know about. But you just can't get away with this that easy. How many people DIED solely due to those bad medical policies which eventually had to be dropped altogether? That's how bad they were, most had to be dropped, discarded, dumped because they were just that bad. Was God behind them? Did God say No Vaccinations for 23 years and then change his mind and say vaccinations are now okay to have? All the while vaccinations were stomping out polio, smallpox and so much more.

21,"The root of the human rights and terrorism problems is not the Quran or Islam, per se. It is the dominance of conservative Arabic culture, much of which is brutally vengeful, sexist, racist and regressive.

Will non-arab muslims ever demand major islamic reforms to unequivocally disentagle their peoples' faith from Arabic hegemony? Until then, Islam will be mistrusted by the rest of the world, and rightly so.

Christians had to do this 500 years ago, and the result was the Reformation and the flourishing of Europe.

43,"That the Holy See would even consider suggesting that seminarians learn about ecology and the climate change mythology of the left, demonstrates how far the Papacy has fallen under Francis.

What seminarians need to learn is how to deal with the unruly, rude, intrusive, demanding, unforgiving, hateful laity that they will find fill many of the pews in a typical parish (especially in suburban areas).  How to cope with a female parishioner who asks the parish's housekeeper to go through the trash and count up the number of wine bottles Father drank, and to look through the letters on Father's desk and report anything interesting (as one priest friend of mine experienced - this really happened!); hot to deal with theologically and liturgically ignorant parishioners who, nonetheless, feel free to comment on Father's homily or presidential style at Mass, these are among the things future priests need to know.",0,-8.170806274332886,8.170806274332886

44,"So, by your argument, we should be ramping back Sikhs because they have far more MPs, MPPs and MLAs than their population in Canada warrants, and similarly ramping back Chinese-Canadians in Chemistry, Math and Medicine, because they are heavily over represented in those fields in preference to the humanities? How about ramping back women in Psychology, Sociology, Fine Arts, Education, Nutrition or any of the other university fields they predominate?  How about university as a whole? Should we be concerned about 62% of our university graduates being women when they are 51% of our population?

Comparing against hard percentages of the general population is asinine.  You have to compare against the APPLICATION RATE.  There's 7-8 men who come forward to be a candidate in every riding for every woman. They don't apply for the job in a hard 51/49 ratio like they exist in the population, so there's a darn good reason there's more men in political power than women.",0,-7.589600699748425,7.589600699748425
