But of course, if one craves the private devotion at mass fostered in the 1950s, then one may well not care much for the communal liturgy (which incidentally is what the Greek word means) where externals matter.

The past enters the present in the person of the newborn; parents bring the past forward in their children. Parent/ child relationships are critical in the aspect of remaining faithful to the past, anticipating the future in children, and being consistently conscionable in present living, and in their expectations of their children - where the 'rubber hits the road', so to speak.
The grandparent/ grandchild relationship is mellower than parent/ child relationships - which makes grandparents effective arbiters of witnessing the past with (perhaps) a clearer moral focus on the future.
In faith/ family/ future, Church, like the family unit, authentically evolves and brings the past-forward (sacra-ment) by way of trustful communication, informed consciousness and committed conscience.

2. God's will is expressed also in the events that He allows in our life, the sequence of events and people that surround us.  God wills most people to be share in His creative power, by having and being in families. Fecundity is His will for most.

3. God speaks also to us through reason. It's reasonable to conclude that we are limited human beings, that we don't have infinite anything.  We are finite.    We can't love everyone with the same availability and sensitivity.  We have limited time, energy, attention span. 

4. So reason tells us that the people God wants most of us to love the most, are those that he places closet to us.

Yes, Marcelo, I find that fascinating myself, especially the statement of the English bishop, William Kenny: ""The Lutheran dialogue is nearer to us [Catholics] than the Anglican one is, even doctrinally. As dialogues go, it has been quite successful."" One wonders if it is because the Church of Sweden feels freer to act -- not only because it dropped being the official state church in 2000 (though continues to have a special status) but also because it retains the allegiance of 63% of the people. That is, no longer a state church, it is able to imagine a substantially new religious identity. Contrast that with the Church of England, still a state established church (with 24 unelected bishops sitting in Parliament) but unable to retain the allegiance of 80% of the population (less than 20% of the population identifies as Anglican in a recent poll).

Remember that when this dialogue was originally used, the people had elected the person they wanted to preside at their eucharist.

Ordination was a prayer that this person be strengthened by the Spirit to put this [Spirit-given] gift at the service of the community.

So I believe ""... with your spirit"" was not just a recognition of ordination, but the people affirming why they chose this person to be ordained to be the presider at their Eucharist.

So I say, yes by all means ask the people to respond ""And with your Spirit"" ... but FIRST restore the ancient tradition of the people choosing their candidate for ordination.

It was initiated by Pope Damasus I, to bring the Bible to the people,iwho enlisted St. Jerome, completed in 384. .The latter  had acess to the great Theological Libreary at Caesarea Maritima, containing over 30,000 manuscripts. According to Eusebius (~300 AD), & possibly contained more information then we have today about early Christiant. Such as the semetic gospel of Matthew Pantaenus brought back from India. 

As with copying manuscripts, errors cre ep, so the Vulgate was considered the standard by which copies & translations were held to, by the Church. One has to remember, that back then, oral communication was the norm, such as the town crier..Hence for the most part, the Church took keeping the Sacred Texts, ""pure"", pretty seriously.

Take the Eucharist. For 1500+ years it was explained in terms of pre-Christian religious ritual, like sacrifice and altars. The final stage in a sacrifice is the sharing of the victim to enable a distribution of the numinous among the believers.
The same ritual can be reinterpreted from a different perspective. Instead of the sacrifice as explanatory key, the meal can be understood as Christ's purpose. Christ died so that we can share in his life. The concluding communal meal is a more effective key today than the rarely experienced ritual sacrifice, in a Church based on communion.

Perhaps a limit of 80 or 120 was sufficient when the Church was mostly ""Old World"" and places that were settled (conquered?) by those from the Old World.  In many of these places - Europe, South/Central America, North America, Australia, the dominant culture, and certainly the culture with power, is an offshoot of the Old World cultures.  My point is that there was a great deal of cultural coherence - Old World - in how the Church grew, developed, even in its doctrine (?), and certainly in whom power was concentrated.  

Now the cultural dominance of the Old World and imposition of a foreign culture on a conquered nation is no longer happening.  Africa and Asia, where the faith is growing, are not culturally indoctrinated - they maintain a hold on their ages old cultures.

For example Japan is a bucket case economically but tied for top place as the best place to live. Further the US, tops in wealth and bottom as a place to live.

“Many people misunderstand the gift of prophecy to be the ability to predict the future.”

“Jude 3 speaks of “the faith which was once delivered unto the saints”… In other words, the faith to which we hold has been settled forever, and it does not need the addition or refinement that comes from extra-biblical revelations.”

“The spiritual gift of prophecy, in the sense of receiving new revelations from God to be proclaimed to others, ceased with the completion of the Bible.”
 
“Christians are to be very wary of those who claim to have a “new” message from God. It is one thing to say, “I had an interesting dream last night.” However, it is quite another matter to say, “God gave me a dream last night, and you must obey it.”

To generalize that, Aquinas says the God is pure act, with no potential to be anything else. When we act, we change: when God acts, God acts. We see God act and conclude God changes. God is not unchanging in the way a rock is unchanging, unmoving, still. God is always acting, it is the divine nature.

So within about 70 years after the Resurrection, there was an organization communicating across the Mediterranean. Not the type of an organization waiting for the end of the world.

A secret gathering of Bishops and Cardinals in the Catacombes where they promised to do all they could to promote the Jesus of the Gospels and build a Church which was more loving, compassionate, forgiving etc.. to restore to the Church the face of Christ. Helder Camera was apparently present, as were many Latin/South American Bishops. Pope Francis knew men who were present at that Mass and reportedly signed up to that pact. The way he led his life as Cardinal and Bishop would indicate that this is true.

Learning involves more than the receipt and the regurgitation of information.  If we want students to synthesize material, draw inferences, see new connections, evaluate evidence, and apply concepts in novel situations, we need to encourage the deep, effortful cognitive processes that underlie these abilities.

We simply don't know or the knowledge may have been suppressed. Either way, the USCCB can now determine how fast it wants to move. Barring a special meeting, the earliest they can decide is their Annual meeting. They could simply go back to 2010 or adopt the 1998 ICEL that was never implemented or they could decide to study and do nothing. They seem to be good at the latter.

As a result the resolution for these questions  falls to each local and regional church to consider; arriving at a consensus (presumably with a sense of the faithful). The goal being that they inform the Archbishop of Rome what they have learned and or the episcopate enters anther synod to iron out these responses.

So he picked a topic that ought, he thought, to have been easy...finding some way to legitimize faithful remarried-divorced Catholics receiving the Eucharist, as many were already doing. So Francis asked Kasper to outline various sound theological ways this could be done. There was nothing novel in what he wrote for professional theologians, but when he wrote was novel for many less theologically astute Catholics, including many bishops.

I was trying to make a different point. This is not the first time in the Church's history that the language of the culture has changed. The first time round (from Greek to Latin) the Church embraced the change, and as a result its theology was enriched. The Church missed out on another paradigm language change moment at the time of the Reformation. Vatican II had the courage to accept the challenge of the vernacular. 

My basic point is about using the change in language as an opportunity to advance theological thinking, instead of being restricted to answers from the past.

Now, the bigger question is whether any of this disclosure forces the cultural changes in government to lesson (or in the case of doing business at Club Evergreen) or eliminate these behaviors. 

My cynical answer - nope. It might be lessened for a little while - meaning that Club Evergreen ain't going to have as many elected officials walking through their door for ""business meetings"".

However, Jehovah's witnesses are message bearers (Witnesses).  We are bearing the message that Jehovah is the true God, His purpose has always been the same.  That purpose does not include unrighteousness.  Therefore, the days of unrighteousness are numbered.  His Kingdom is the means by which He will restore this Earth to His original purpose.

We noticed that once the kids hit high school their oxygen uptakes dramatically decreased. 
So what I'm saying is that if we influence children with regular exercise when their young, then their natural drop off will be less when they hit puberty. 
Picard is right. Kids are meant to move constantly. A 15 minute run/ brisk walk is a start. Not a solution. Everything fitness related starts at home very early. Parents can be a solution .

Because of how money is disbursed, you have to lag the effect (growth) one year and must do a separate curve for each tax regime. The Bush regime ended when ATRA was passed in 2013.

In this way, the Church has argued that the species of bread and wine become the ""substance"" of the body, blood, soul and divinity of Jesus Christ, even as the ""accidents"" of bread and wine remain. Thus, according to Trent and prior councils, anyone who approaches the sacrament in the state of sin does so unworthily (borrowing a Pauline phrase) and commits a sin. 
Vatican II largely reaffirmed the sacramental theology of Trent while simultaneously pointing to a broader, less Aristotelian understanding of sacraments.

One result of this could be that everyone who discerns the action of God in their lives will realize their remarriage was sinful.

There are (and often are in terms of Scripture) only human agents involved in its composition. Which means we have to be very careful in interpreting it (and even more careful not to put base words in God's mouth. The Pharisees did this, and Jesus rarely had a good word to say about them.)

Isaiah 'wrote' in politically and socially very uncertain times: the Assyrian empire had already swallowed up the northern kingdom, Israel, and the southern kingdom, Judah, might be next?

Our bishops need to have an accountability not just to the pope, but to the people they supposedly lead.

Incidentally, in my view, it is not just historical depth in time but also historical breadth in geography (the Byzantine, Syrian, Egyptian Traditions) of the first millennium that warrant change. Since the Great Church (as come call it) of the first millennium was largely united, all the theologies of  all those culturally diverse Churches are fully valid today as markers in the past of what could be in the future.

Without it, Quebec would probably have left the federation.

Fortunately for Yours Truly and my good wife (a SDA church school teacher), we are blessed to be part of a local church that pulls together with our (multi-church) school.

Talents for low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity, may alone suffice to elevate a man to the first honors in a single State; but it will require other talents, and a different kind of merit, to establish him in the esteem and confidence of the whole Union, or of so considerable a portion of it as would be necessary to make him a successful candidate for the distinguished office of President of the United States.""

19833,"At least some German prelates are proceeding in Christ's light, as Francis has advised.  The pastoral approach of Francis has two advantages.  

First, it is a practical work-around to the Pharisaical preoccupation with legal formulations that has gripped the institutional Church in matters related to marriage and the family.

Second, a pastoral focus gives breathing room for people to center themselves on the Spirit of Christ in their hearts.  This centering moves toward the reign of God that Jesus preached.

Muller and the four cardinals don't appreciate how much distance there is from the Church when a person struggling to discern their conscience cannot be confident that a pastor will encourage that discernment.  Francis is encouraging that discernment.

And, in the end, that discernment restores the primacy of the great commandments to love God and neighbor.  Lack of ""exceptions"" to a subordinate principle -- such as indissolubility -- risks denying the primacy of love.",0,-2.6214364551774323,2.6214364551774323

It does seem pretty obvious that Francis' Church and the magisterium are not at all pointed in the same direction.

The Ecumenism of Vatican II is to thank in large part for the shift that had the Church and secular moving in the same direction on a few key issues.

What progress has been made apart from us being nice to each other? 
The joint declarations on salvation and justification aren't worth the paper they were written on. One has to remember that even though the Joint Declaration (JDDJ) was agreed between the Pontifical Council for the Promotion of Christian Unity (PCPCU) and the Lutheran World Federation (LWF) neither has the authority to bind this agreement upon those who they represent;  of the 124 members of the LWF 35 rejected the JDDJ. Other Lutheran member churches have repudiated the agreement in its entirety.
ARCIC has been going on for around 50 years. Progress here again is limited to being nice to each other. Whatever the ARCIC negotiators agree upon, it seems that immediately the goal-posts get moved, the ordination of women as priests then further on as bishops.

Your Honda Odyssey has a rather bad reputation which is unusual but the repair cost for the vehicle transmission averages at US$3423.00 so it would have been cheaper to repair your Honda.  Regarding your Leaf I note that owners seem to be extremely happy with their vehicles at first but after three years a noticeable drop off in range of 30-50% is noted on the various consumer sites I've visited.  From what I can tell it's not the battery that's failing but individual cells within the battery pack itself.  Nissan offers little in the way of a solution except replacement hopefully within the warranty.  Fortunately this problem has become common enough for a new industry to arise which offers a solution namely in the form of a rebuilt salvaged battery.

 I believe my comment above with the attached link to my post, attempts to enlighten our understanding of the “The Fall” and complement biblical teaching, that has been given to mankind by our Creator through His Spirit.

The kingdom of God is within us, if one is to search for further understanding one has to attempt to lift oneself out of the mire/mud that is covered by mist, the knowledge that is needed to do this is self-knowledge, and this can only come about by serving the Truth in humility (to know yourself as you truly are) as His inviolate Word (Will) is not open for debate, we His creatures can only bow down before His Will (Word)

Peacemakers are those serene and humble souls who are so trusting of the Holy Spirit's guidance that they will enter the fray armed with only an ability to love and to forgive. Their only protection is the abiding grace and mercy of Almighty God. And the only law they have is God's Law. Humbly, they will refuse any man-made compromise of God's Law, because they know God's Law is the very definition of love. For them, justice is not really a clarion call they proclaim for others, but rather is a solemn personal obligation ""to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.""

Then Jesus responded to those who had murmured against Him, saying, “For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost” (Luke 19:10).

1. Increasingly, we are training a whole generation of children and their parents that church and active, involved, contribution, as stated above are optional and not essential.  Again, whichever side of the issue you might take - it is important to make the decision intentionally instead of drifting into it.  Maybe church should no longer be the important element in the lives of Adventist christians - but if we allow the trend to continue we will suffer a catastrophic result.

Thus I conform to my divinity
By dying inward, like an aging tree.

Breaks on me as my meager flesh breaks down—
The soul delights in that extremity.
Blessed the meek; they shall inherit wrath;
I’m son and father of my only death.

She may be surmising, with good warrant, that poor women of color would suffer more from the consequences of a ban than their more privileged sisters.  Strange as her prose is, I don't think she was proposing that there was no racial injustice currently influencing the reproductive choices of poor minorities. 

West is apparently conflating a ""pro-life stance"" with an abolitionist agenda. Her reluctance to welcome and support candidates in favor of outlawing abortion into the Democrat party may be, as MSW says, politically inexpedient for the party itself. But if West holds a strong commitment to women's rights in their bodies, as seems to be the case, it's hardly surprising that she'd see supporting candidates that favor abolition as both politically unhelpful and morally problematic.",0,0.07494652869452723,0.07494652869452723

The connection between ""control over global Catholic assets"" and the lack of accountability for hierarchs and priests cannot be overstated.  The mountains money the hierarchs control has funded all the hush money, all the lawyers and public relations consultants, all the political cover from law enforcement.

If Catholics take away hierarchs access to $billions, their hearts and minds will soon follow.  Right now, all bishops - under the legal precept of ""corporation sole"" - control all money and property of every diocese and every parish, including the salaries and health care of all priests [which hierarchs in turn use to intimidate priests into silence, obedience and complicity].  

Catholics must break these chains the hierarchs have to hold our priesthood and the People hostage to their political hegemony over the rest of the church.

37670,"""NEW YORK ― Hours after he celebrated a vote in the House of Representatives to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, President Donald Trump praised Australia’s publicly funded, universal health care system.
The bill that Trump and congressional Republicans were celebrating Thursday afternoon dramatically scales back government assistance that helps Americans pay for health care. The 2010 law, also known as Obamacare, had expanded coverage to 20 million more Americans, and an analysis of an earlier version of the GOP bill passed Thursday estimated it would cause 24 million Americans to lose coverage.""

The Army routinely visit Rohingya farms in large numbers, take anything of value, and if the Rohingya say ONE WORD or show a DEFIANT LOOK, they burn down one of their outbuildings.

If there are reprisals, the Army returns in a few days and kills that family. If there are further reprisals, then the Army and non-Army Buddhists return and burn down the entire village, sometimes rape the women and take off with the livestock.

Politico’s Glenn Thrush, who was exposed in WikiLeaks emails sending stories to Hillary Clinton staffers before publication, will be joining the New York Times to cover the White House, The Huffington Post reported Monday.

While Bumiller described Thrush as a “premier political journalist,” in one email to Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta, Thrush chose to describe himself as a “hack.”
.
“No worries Because I have become a hack I will send u the whole section that pertains to u,” Thrush wrote to Podesta in an April 2015 email. “Please don’t share or tell anyone I did this Tell me if I f****d up anything.”

Craig Medred has been following a data string that suggests there are too many hatchery pinks released in the North Pacific.  They are voracious feeders that out compete other salmon species - king, silver, chum and red - for what is naturally found in the ocean.  It may explain the awful king and silver returns the last decade.  And the hatchery pinks benefit commercial fishermen.

So if this is a problem, how do you solve it?  One way would be to start raising commercial pinks via aquaculture - fish farming - in their own pens so they aren't out in the open out competing other species for available food in the wild.

Somewhere along the line, we are going to have to get a handle on precisely what the carrying capacity (total number of feeding salmon) of the North Pacific actually is.

Non-white racism is no more difficult to make sense of than any other form of racism. There is no reason to fear that the attackers are white or non-white.

Thank you, Denver Post!
This case isn't about the couple wanting an offending type of decoration. The discussion was halted before the type of decoration was even discussed.
Phillips' religious conscience was bothered solely by the presence of a gay couple.
But! Suppose someone else's conscience is bothered by a Muslim couple? A disabled couple? An interracial or interreligious couple?
No, the sole objection here is to gay people, and sexual orientation discrimination violates Colorado law.
If Phillips wants to serve the public, he must serve all of the public.

7176,"And all that is well and good.  You see that we do not need to upend and redefine an entire institution in order to ensure gays receive rights, etc.  If gays need familial rights, we merely need to adapt the law to accommodate that.  The simplest explanation/solution is the one to be preferred.  Instead we went and upended and redefined reality to accommodate gay rights when we didn't need to do that. 

I do not understand how an illegal alien has constitutional rights when they are, by definition, illegal. Not that they don't have any rights, but legal citizens and or those here legally enjoy the rights of the Constitution.  Otherwise--why bother becoming a legal citizen? 

As I have said: the debate about gay marriage is not just about whether prudish and dated religious values should or should not be imposed on an unwilling nation.  The debate is far more than that.  The issue is what constitutes a marriage--not whether gay people can have sex in the privacy of their homes.",0,0.0009103019676708346,0.0009103019676708346

  However, it is more pertinent to say that their decision-making, and their failure to hire professionals who know what they are doing, has led to bad personnel choices, the squandering of the talent they do have, and the erosion of their once-rabid fan bases to historically bad levels, and all of the hot air being pumped in by their sycophants in the press mean nothing.
  Either hire quality professional management and let them do their job, or sell the damn teams to someone who will, or you will continue to see the fans who regularly attended Nuggets and Avs games abandon them.

While he can appear to be a talented musician and upstanding cop, I'm sorry to say that he should not be allowed the responsibility of being a police officer.  This is not the first time he has acted this way, it is just the tip of the iceberg.  As far as 20 years back (at least), this guy has engaged in activities far worse than what is reported in this article.    That is just a tiny sample of the type of behaviour that Doug and others have routinely engaged in while serving EPD for many, many years.  A great majority of the ""wolf pack"" of bad officers have gone away, including most recently former officer Stefan Zeltvay (http://kval.com/news/local/eugene-police-officer-pleads-guilty-to-sexual-harassment-abuse-11-17-2015), and of course Roger Magana and Juan Lara.
