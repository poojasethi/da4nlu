Instead I would say, as an example...""doesn't it also say somewhere in the NT that we should love God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength""?

But of course, if one craves the private devotion at mass fostered in the 1950s, then one may well not care much for the communal liturgy (which incidentally is what the Greek word means) where externals matter.

15586,"BROohthor, your point on conscience, it seems to me speaks to the intergenerational continuity of faith/ family/ future, what is primary ""church"".
The past enters the present in the person of the newborn; parents bring the past forward in their children. Parent/ child relationships are critical in the aspect of remaining faithful to the past, anticipating the future in children, and being consistently conscionable in present living, and in their expectations of their children - where the 'rubber hits the road', so to speak.
The grandparent/ grandchild relationship is mellower than parent/ child relationships - which makes grandparents effective arbiters of witnessing the past with (perhaps) a clearer moral focus on the future.
In faith/ family/ future, Church, like the family unit, authentically evolves and brings the past-forward (sacra-ment) by way of trustful communication, informed consciousness and committed conscience.
Thus, if i may, 'CHURCHES UNITED, in Faith/ Family/ Future'.",0,-3.5408052817211138,3.5408052817211138

One wonders if it is because the Church of Sweden feels freer to act -- not only because it dropped being the official state church in 2000 (though continues to have a special status) but also because it retains the allegiance of 63% of the people. That is, no longer a state church, it is able to imagine a substantially new religious identity. Contrast that with the Church of England, still a state established church (with 24 unelected bishops sitting in Parliament) but unable to retain the allegiance of 80% of the population (less than 20% of the population identifies as Anglican in a recent poll).

Take the Eucharist. For 1500+ years it was explained in terms of pre-Christian religious ritual, like sacrifice and altars. The final stage in a sacrifice is the sharing of the victim to enable a distribution of the numinous among the believers.
The same ritual can be reinterpreted from a different perspective. Instead of the sacrifice as explanatory key, the meal can be understood as Christ's purpose. Christ died so that we can share in his life. The concluding communal meal is a more effective key today than the rarely experienced ritual sacrifice, in a Church based on communion.

Remember that when this dialogue was originally used, the people had elected the person they wanted to preside at their eucharist.

Ordination was a prayer that this person be strengthened by the Spirit to put this [Spirit-given] gift at the service of the community.

So I believe ""... with your spirit"" was not just a recognition of ordination, but the people affirming why they chose this person to be ordained to be the presider at their Eucharist.

So I say, yes by all means ask the people to respond ""And with your Spirit"" ... but FIRST restore the ancient tradition of the people choosing their candidate for ordination.

Perhaps a limit of 80 or 120 was sufficient when the Church was mostly ""Old World"" and places that were settled (conquered?) by those from the Old World.  In many of these places - Europe, South/Central America, North America, Australia, the dominant culture, and certainly the culture with power, is an offshoot of the Old World cultures.  My point is that there was a great deal of cultural coherence - Old World - in how the Church grew, developed, even in its doctrine (?), and certainly in whom power was concentrated.  

Now the cultural dominance of the Old World and imposition of a foreign culture on a conquered nation is no longer happening.  Africa and Asia, where the faith is growing, are not culturally indoctrinated - they maintain a hold on their ages old cultures.  

Is 80 or 120 enough to give world wide representation to people of widely different cultures, different experiences?  I don't want 1000, but I wonder if 120 is enough.",0,-3.3622044539225104,3.3622044539225104

“The spiritual gift of prophecy, in the sense of receiving new revelations from God to be proclaimed to others, ceased with the completion of the Bible.”
 
“Christians are to be very wary of those who claim to have a “new” message from God. It is one thing to say, “I had an interesting dream last night.” However, it is quite another matter to say, “God gave me a dream last night, and you must obey it.”

Sometimes we got someone who was a good match for the congregation and sometimes we didn't when when we didn't, that was a big reason why pastors got moved every two or three years. But where I am today, the conference leadership puts considerable effort into trying to understand the needs and goals of the church before picking someone who will be a good match and leaves them there for the long-term. It works very well.",0,-3.219884203051855,3.219884203051855

A Hearing loop won't fix a garbled word. 4) When necessary, qualified sound professionals should be engaged. Acoustics should be part of each church design.

No matter how many alternate lunches were served, the account would not be charged further.

So we're not talking about any lunch account owing a negative $50. I suspect that there are a few thousand accounts sitting with less than $5 owing. I suspect historically most of those balances disappear when parents are reminded to replenish the account when school starts. I'd want to know how this $13K compares to previous years and what happened when school started in the fall.  $13K past due for a system with 92,000 kids and as a portion of what must be the cafeteria budget is probably not newsworthy.

 Many experiement with eastern religion, which does not emphasize doctrine. Buddhism especially attracts  because of its emphasis on compassion, providing group support and tools (such as meditation) as help on the spiritual journey.  They do not seek out some other version of what they left.

Another form of collective prayer could be Benediction/Adoration.
The family Rosary is another form of collective prayer.
Offering one's work (even a specific, perhaps tedious task) to God is a form of prayer.

“Yes, it is time for a new vision of God, creator of the cosmos that is in continuing evolution to ...what? And, a new understanding of the meaning of the incarnation of God as man in Jesus Christ. What did Hir (his/her) coming demonstrate about God and humanity, about God in humanity? Does God evolve, too?  ----------------


Yes we are still coming out of the mud (physical cosmos) into which we fell at The Fall metaphorically speaking.
Our Father has life in Himself and He is Timeless  (Changeless).
Jesus tells us he came (was sent) “To save that which was lost” this statement implies a former state, my understanding of lost is that we are lost in time and place; we all carry a divine timeless spark within us, we are more than a physical being Our Fathers living Word (Will) is singular. The Holy Spirit, Our Fathers divine essence Truth endeavours to enlighten our Consciousness in revealing the apex (Beauty) of His earthly creation

God gave us a marvelous way of participating in His Divine nature by giving us the power to 'sanctify' (to make holy) everything we do and touch.  But it takes our Yes, our alertness, our love to do this. 

St Josemaria Escriva:

""And it is this life which has to become, in both soul and body, holy and filled with God. We discover the invisible God in the most visible and material things. There is no other way. Either we learn to find our Lord in ordinary, everyday life, or else we shall never find Him. That is why I can tell you that our age needs to give back to matter and to the most trivial occurrences and situations their noble and original meaning. It needs to restore them to the service of the Kingdom of God, to spiritualize them, turning them into a means and an occasion for a continuous meeting with Jesus Christ.""",0,-3.0989898405535863,3.0989898405535863

I was trying to make a different point. This is not the first time in the Church's history that the language of the culture has changed.

The Church missed out on another paradigm language change moment at the time of the Reformation. Vatican II had the courage to accept the challenge of the vernacular. 

My basic point is about using the change in language as an opportunity to advance theological thinking, instead of being restricted to answers from the past.

It is my understanding that Francis wanted to have collegial synods, in which all bishops openly expressed their minds, work out their disagreements, and reach a consensus, rather than, as had been the case with P6, JP2, and B16 have the college affirm a pre-existing papal decision expressed in the preparatory document. 

So he picked a topic that ought, he thought, to have been easy...finding some way to legitimize faithful remarried-divorced Catholics receiving the Eucharist, as many were already doing. So Francis asked Kasper to outline various sound theological ways this could be done. There was nothing novel in what he wrote for professional theologians, but when he wrote was novel for many less theologically astute Catholics, including many bishops.

Two synod was held; 2/3 agreement not found; so Francis brilliantly restated prior theology including the internal forum as a solution.",0,-2.9754373527042812,2.9754373527042812

So what I'm saying is that if we influence children with regular exercise when their young, then their natural drop off will be less when they hit puberty. 
Picard is right. Kids are meant to move constantly. A 15 minute run/ brisk walk is a start. Not a solution. Everything fitness related starts at home very early. Parents can be a solution .

However, Jehovah's witnesses are message bearers (Witnesses).  We are bearing the message that Jehovah is the true God, His purpose has always been the same.  That purpose does not include unrighteousness.  Therefore, the days of unrighteousness are numbered.  His Kingdom is the means by which He will restore this Earth to His original purpose.

In this way, the Church has argued that the species of bread and wine become the ""substance"" of the body, blood, soul and divinity of Jesus Christ, even as the ""accidents"" of bread and wine remain. Thus, according to Trent and prior councils, anyone who approaches the sacrament in the state of sin does so unworthily (borrowing a Pauline phrase) and commits a sin. 
Vatican II largely reaffirmed the sacramental theology of Trent while simultaneously pointing to a broader, less Aristotelian understanding of sacraments. Theologians have followed that direction in laying our a much more biblical and dynamic understanding of how God becomes present to us through the sacraments.

We had growth and recession in deficits. However, if you adjust the deficit with the net interest paid you factor that in and analysis can occur. Because of how money is disbursed, you have to lag the effect (growth) one year and must do a separate curve for each tax regime. The Bush regime ended when ATRA was passed in 2013.

Isaiah 'wrote' in politically and socially very uncertain times: the Assyrian empire had already swallowed up the northern kingdom, Israel, and the southern kingdom, Judah, might be next?

The key issue is whether one regards Tradition as virtually unchanged, or constantly changing. Once one grasps the constancy of theological development in the past, the Tradition becomes a great friend, for it is the unassailable warrant for the changes we desperately need today. 

Incidentally, in my view, it is not just historical depth in time but also historical breadth in geography (the Byzantine, Syrian, Egyptian Traditions) of the first millennium that warrant change. Since the Great Church (as come call it) of the first millennium was largely united, all the theologies of  all those culturally diverse Churches are fully valid today as markers in the past of what could be in the future.

However, Pope John Paul II intervened to strip or weaken the authority of every collegial body that emerged after the Council. When the US Bishops were working on their pastoral letter, “The Challenge of Peace”, John Paul did not object to their teaching -- he was to their left; he objected to their method: they were (gasp!) listening to experts and ordinary people from a variety of walks of life; not all of them clerics; not all of them even Catholics.

Our bishops need to have an accountability not just to the pope, but to the people they supposedly lead.

One result of this could be that everyone who discerns the action of God in their lives will realize their remarriage was sinful.

He taught that we all had access to agape' love, not just the few who could recite the rules.     

Faith is not passive, it's an active search by each of us.  Jesus turned the hierarchy and expectation of the Jewish faith upside down.     You might find it fun to take your faith with serious intention and share with others who believe in the guidance of the Spirit and living revelation.

Well, if He made us ""temples of your love"", we can pull up a chair, prop up our feet, and have a smoke. ""Temples of your love""is the goal, not our current state.

The Holy Spirit is invoked in Eucharistic Prayers east and west for the epiclesis, the making of bread and wine into the Body and Blood, and nothing else.

A few privately-owned toll roads here and there can work, but it wouldn't work for the bulk of roads to work that way.  That's simply a function that has to be shared, and provided by government.  Same way with national defense, the court system, the monetary supply, and some other things.

That's the threshold I think should be applied to pretty much all government functions (especially at the federal level).

These two theological spheres are 'practical' means of seeking understanding via faith (theology). They needn't be bogged down by the arcane terminologies of imperfect philosophies (e.g. Aristotelianism, Thomism) applied in more systematic means of doing theology.

Understanding and expression are very important in the sphere of Liturgy. If we don't allow Liturgy to develop liturgically, but instead use our imperfect philosophical-theological lexicon to supress expression rather than to guide it, then how can we model the parrhesia of the Church that we read about in the Acts of the Apostles?

First, it is a practical work-around to the Pharisaical preoccupation with legal formulations that has gripped the institutional Church in matters related to marriage and the family.

Second, a pastoral focus gives breathing room for people to center themselves on the Spirit of Christ in their hearts.  This centering moves toward the reign of God that Jesus preached.

Muller and the four cardinals don't appreciate how much distance there is from the Church when a person struggling to discern their conscience cannot be confident that a pastor will encourage that discernment.  Francis is encouraging that discernment.

And, in the end, that discernment restores the primacy of the great commandments to love God and neighbor.  Lack of ""exceptions"" to a subordinate principle -- such as indissolubility -- risks denying the primacy of love.",0,-2.785909649988575,2.785909649988575

""From this it follows that every liturgical celebration, because it is an action of Christ the priest and his Body which is the Church, is a sacred action surpassing all others; no other action of the Church can equal its efficacy by the same title and to the same degree"" (Sacrosanctum Concilium, paragraph 7).

The unity Jesus seeks of his followers is primarily a unity in love, not doctrine. I don't deny the importance of doctrine, but I do deny that it has supreme importance. Belief in (intellectual assent to) the dogma of the Eucharist cannot redeem a person: only Eucharistic love, manifested in and through word and deed, can do this. Note, however, that intellectual assent to Eucharistic dogma is not a condition for exercising the love referenced by the dogma.",0,-2.672615849448431,2.672615849448431

The original completed Nicene Creed [381 A.D], declared that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father---period.  Western bishops at the Third Council of Toledo in 589 AD added ""and the son"" to the original version of the creed.  Therefore, the Catholic Profession of Faith states today, ""proceeds from the Father and the Son.""  But scripture is clear that Jesus says unequivocally, ""I will send him [the Holy Spirit] to you.""  The Greek Christians agreed with this, but they argued that 'sending' and 'proceeding' are not the same thing.  To them, the word ""proceed"" was equivalent to the word 'begot,' as in the verse in the creed which refers to the Son as begotten of the Father.  Greek Christians argued that ONLY the Father could beget, and thus BOTH the Son and the Spirit had to proceed from the Father.",0,-2.670129424923681,2.670129424923681

It is crucially important to understand that prior to the schism of 1054, Christians were aware of and fully accepted each others divergent sacramental practices. The loss of one of what JP2 called the ""two lungs"" of Christianity in that schism has contributed to a narrowing of perspective in both the East and West.

The kingdom of God is within us, if one is to search for further understanding one has to attempt to lift oneself out of the mire/mud that is covered by mist, the knowledge that is needed to do this is self-knowledge, and this can only come about by serving the Truth in humility (to know yourself as you truly are) as His inviolate Word (Will) is not open for debate, we His creatures can only bow down before His Will (Word)

Jehovah's organization continues to grow and to prosper in its primary activity, spreading the Kingdom message.  This fact differs from your suggestion that the internet is presenting arguments that God's favor does not reside with Witnesses.
 
Your dogmatic comments do not align with scripture.  For example, your comment ""GOD would not get things wrong like too many end of world predictions to count.""  God was not the interpreter, men were.  Historically there are many historic accounts of God's chosen people making the wrong decisions or reaching incorrect conclusions.

My point, really, is that delaying childbirth until you've established economic stability is the core prerequisite to maintaining economic stability. You'll be ahead if you can do this while in a stable marriage (or long term relationship), either because two incomes are better than one, or because one party can maintain employment while the other raises kids.

Jesus understand they did not know understand all.  Jehovah later blessed Peter and many others with anointing with Holy Spirit.   They sill had much to learn.

Then Jesus responded to those who had murmured against Him, saying, “For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost” (Luke 19:10).

Actual life is often 'messy'. People sometimes need to do the best they can in the circumstances of their life. Hopefully 'the Church' can walk with them and help them along the way.

Strangely enough, sometimes it is our well-meaning 'rules' that set up a situation that causes the opposite of what is intended. 

Case in point: A man once came to arrange for baptism of the couple's 6th child. Upon enquiry, it turned out they never were 'married in the Church'.
Reason given was: 'Oh, Father, to get married in the Church is something SERIOUS! Before you do that, you want to be SURE!!

Sweet Christ, rejoice in my infirmity;

And pumped a shoulder full of cortisone;
Thus I conform to my divinity
By dying inward, like an aging tree.

The instant ages on the living eye;
Light on its rounds, a pure extreme of light
Breaks on me as my meager flesh breaks down—
The soul delights in that extremity.
Blessed the meek; they shall inherit wrath;
I’m son and father of my only death.

Increasingly in the minds of many Adventists, school and its activities are essential and the church is optional - if nothing else is going on.

One can argue the merits of that and miss the pragmatic point.  Actually three points.

1. Increasingly, we are training a whole generation of children and their parents that church and active, involved, contribution, as stated above are optional and not essential.  Again, whichever side of the issue you might take - it is important to make the decision intentionally instead of drifting into it.  Maybe church should no longer be the important element in the lives of Adventist christians - but if we allow the trend to continue we will suffer a catastrophic result.

There is a phenomenon that I have observed and experienced in many successful endeavors - we tend to become a ""victim of our own success"".

In a very peculiar sense, we have a built-in contradiction in Adventist thinking.  Individually and institutionally, ""success"" constitutes reaching the point of irrelevance - when Jesus returns to take us ALL home the SDA church and its various institutions will cease to exist!

LDS and JW theologies ascribe a special role in the Afterlife, for their adherents.  Some Adventists do likewise with their emphasis on ""last generation"" or 144,000 motifs.

Yes, Jesus does require repentance and conversion, but nowhere in Scripture does it state, or even imply, that he expects us to live forever with the consequences of past mistakes.

Indeed, divorce for a woman was a a sure indicator of a future of destitution.  In US catholic literature on marriage in those days, especially written for pastors, there was no, 'if he hits you, then leave'. More like: 'if he hits you, then try harder to love him and be a good wife.'
- So, while grandmother might have known that the US bishop rescinded in 1884 their 1840 degree that divorce incurs automatic excommunication, she would be still certain that her vows meant something, and that her church, in those days, would have little sympathy for her as divorced or separated.",0,-2.526237524593572,2.526237524593572

It was ONLY after the persecutions---that the groups of Christians all around the Middle East and the Mediterranean, and their elected [cheirotonesate] leaders, called 'episkopoi' or bishops, realized that maybe the world wasn't ending 'right away'.

From within Seventh-day Adventism, then, what is the job the vast majority of Seventh-day Adventist church members continue to hire the church to do for them?

The church has taken great effort to make this clear.

As a condition of baptism into the salvation defined by the church, the church requires people to publically confirm their determination to remain true to the published fundamental beliefs of the church, the church having self-defined itself as ‘God’s highest authority on earth’ pending the return of Jesus.

To change the church structure thus calls into question the validity of its creed and thus the spiritual security of its members.

Marking the 1988 tercentennial anniversary of Sir Isaac Newton's earth-shattering Principia Mathematica, Pope St. John Paul II issued a remarkable letter concerning the relationship between religion and science.  Explaining that ""Religion is not founded on science nor is science an extension of religion,"" JP II called upon both science and religion to work together ""to build a culture that is more humane and in that way more divine.""

Theologians are not the Magesterium.  The bishops comprise the Magesterium.  It is the bishops who read what the theologians write and judge whether they are in err, not the other way around.

In the Catholic Church, merit is not a function of office., office is a function of merit.  In other words--a bishop's consecration and ordination is what qualifies them to be the teacher of the Faith, not their academic credentials.

The whole problem with dissenting theologians is precisely that they do not understand their proper role.  The role of the theologian is to show how what the Church teaches is contained in the sources of revelation.

It was; and it was rooted more in church politics than in civil politics, although the two overlapped. Bernardin was a priest of the Council (Vatican II) and a bishop of the Conference (the National Conference), by which I mean his life and ministry were rooted in the Council's teaching and vision of collegiality. Prior to being named Archbishop of Cincinnati, he was Associate General Secretary of the Conference;  as bishop and cardinal, he was immersed in the work of the Conference. He was Chair of the committee that drafted 'The Challenge of Peace'; he served as President of the Conference. When Pope John Paul began his assault on collegiality, Bernardin was (at least) collateral damage. Cardinal Law, who could not get elected to a committee chairmanship in the Conference, led the opposition to Bernardin's Common Ground initiative.

I'm not one to understand prophesies, but if memory serves, sometimes they come out in ways that we don't expect.  I would suggest that an institutional church could continue on after Francis, with a pope, and yet for all practical purposes, the church will have come down so far as to cross over into the general noise of society: essentially no more relevant than any other religion, secular organization, etc.   Under such a scenario, there would not need to be complete destruction/disappearance of the institution or it's popes: simply the realization that it no longer matters, that it affects few people, and has little influence on society.

Given the numbers who have left, or who stayed but effectively ""checked out,"" and the impact this will have on long term church demographics,  and the effective loss of trust in the institution triggered by the bishops, it may well be that Malachy could be correct, even if there are future popes.

Then I was what was called in care process for at least one year. During the in care process, the authorizing group could drop the candidate for any or no reason.  During this process, similar to a student teacher, I was observed and would communicate with the ordained pastor at least weekly. At this point, if any information came forward from anyone and there were questions, the candidate would have to answer the questions before the authorizing group. If they felt there were allegations, then the candidate would have to answer further. The questioning could head into any direction and so the candidate had to become like recent U.S. Supreme Court Justice Candidate. Don't say too much!

I understand that the latter adjectival phrase communicates, more intelligibly than the former adjective, that Jesus is united to the Father in a way that no creature is. Moreover, by means of Aristotelian metaphysical terminology, 'consubstantial' intends to communicate that Jesus' substantial form is that of the Father's, whereas ours is that of creation. 

The adjectival phrase 'one in being', I argue, communicates the distinction of Jesus from the rest of humankind, as the Nicaean and Constantinopolitan creeds intended. The adjective 'consubstantial' does the same, albeit in a vocabulary foreign to all individuals, praying in the English language, who are not familiar with Aristotelian metaphysical co-principles, such as matter and form.

38272,"Thank, Brother. Agreed. 

Indeed a study was done under P6 and then, as you say, that study was suppressed. I believe the essence of the suppressed report was published in Italian by Cipriano Vagaggini in 1974 in Orientalia Christiana Periodica and belated translated into English as a 65 page booklet ""Ordination of Women in the Diaconate in the Eastern Chruches: Essays by Cirpriano Vagaggini,"" edited by Phyllis Zagano, 2013. Ratzinger not only suppressed that study but ordered a contrary study which the CDF did publish. The prime author of the published work was Aime-
George Montimort, whose views are available in English as ""Deaconesses: An Historical Study, 1986.""

So there is  dispute. The essence of the dispute, IMO, hangs on being able to adopt the Orthodox understanding of their own liturgical books (Euchlogia in this case) which are consistent on female deacons from the 8th to 14th century. All agree deaconess had distinct functions.

22333,"""Based on the authors examples of Trump and vaccines, the author is talking about sympathy and compassion, both of which require of us to take sides.""

That's incorrect. There's nothing about either sympathy or compassion that requires taking a side. 

The taking of sides is a strategic act, typically informed by both cognitive and emotional factors. Once a side is chosen, it tends to interfere with normal feelings of empathy and compassion. For example, when a player on the opposing team is injured, you're less likely to feel empathy for him than you would if it was a player on the team you support.

At least from a Buddhist's point of view, compassion can take no side. It's not an emotion. It's a state of being that's given freely to every living thing, without moralizing or politicizing the circumstances. Empathy on the other hand is an emotional connection between you and someone else, typically due to difficult circumstances the other is experiencing.",0,-2.3614866029373935,2.3614866029373935

In this particular case, I believe the thrust of the Catholic position has been consistent--life in the womb, whenever and however that was understood to begin at different times in our history, is sacred, and not to be violated--regardless of lack of scriptural warrant.

Francis lives that discernment, so I just assume that the cautious path he is leading us down is precisely the way the Spirit is calling him. A radical progressive pope imposing his own will on the Church would be just as destructive as JP2, a radical conservative pope who did impose his will on us, because he believed in V1 not V2. Both lead to schism. Francis is NOT leading us on a middle course between the two, but rather is setting the scene for acceptance of and comfort with open, substantial disagreement, and that is the arena in which the Spirit can do her thing best.

My second anecdote was in Francis initial long interview give to half a dozen Jesuit magazine around the world. There was some important inside baseball there, largely missed by commentators.

Based only on his public image and statements, I think there are two crucial observations. 

First, he is adamant to actualize the eccesiology of V2, which P6, JP2 and P16 have systematically ignored, preferring V1. Second, he is utterly focused on a Christianity of service of others. The latter is, I think, both an expression of his own enormous heart and a conscious decision to point forward in a direction the neither side can gainsay. And this is the characteristic that seems to make him adorable to just about anyone of good will.

But in the longer term, IMHO, it is the first propensity that is most important. Given our history from at least Trent, it is absolutely astonishing that Francis demands open discussion among bishops as V2 presumed.

Actually went to the game last night, I had to watch this battle in person, had a really good seat and I will leave at that. Couple of things, as I suspected Paxton really can't read a defense, that was very evident from my vantage point. Paxton would look at 1 or 2 Wrs, if they weren't open he would just run, whether or not the pocket broke down, that is a major red flag to me. And the few times he stay in the pocket for the most part couldn't located an open Wr in early part of the game.

The part most of you guys didn't see was when the Broncos went to commercial, the coaches were huddle around Paxton basically tell him the coverage. The coaches were basically telling Lynch the Bears are were running a few basic coverages. For the most part, the Bears were in cover two most of the night, Trevor Siemian know it and was slicing and dicing the Bears for 6/7 for 51 yards. The Bears weren't going to give up anything deep early on, be it Trevor or Paxton.

Conclusion

The children living in the well-established fluoridated area had less dental caries and a higher proportion free from disease when compared with the other two areas which were not fluoridated. Fluoridation demonstrated a clear benefit in terms of better oral health for young children.

Religion is Latin for religio meaning to rope together.  This was a well needed structure back in the days when people couldn't read or write.  The rules helped the powerless and enriched the powerful.  I can remember the Latin masses, so filled with awe and mysticism.  They were magic.  If we're talking sin, we don't always need to jump through certain hoops ( esp. if your an inch away from death) to confess.  We can go direct to God.  For those divorced, who aren't allowed to receive communion, this imo is an atrocity. No where does Christ single out the divorced and refuse them a place at the table.

According to the Independent Electricity System Operator, nuclear provided 60% of all electricity consumed in Ontario in 2015.  Hydro provided 24%. Renewables provided less than 8%.

As for costs, the Ontario Energy Board reports that in its regulated price plan for 2014 to 2015 that each unit of hydro generation cost 5.,1 c/kWhr. Nuclear cost 5.9 c/kWhr.  Wind was more than double these rates at 12.3 c/kWhr. As for solar--out of sight at 47.6c/kWhr.

So Mr Dogterom is right on one thing: the numbers don't lie. What the numbers tell us however is that nuclear and hydro generation provide Ontario consumers with low-cost, carbon-free electricity.  And the renewables industry on the margins is less about harvesting nature's bounty than it is about harvesting the subsidized rates handed out by the ON government.",0,-2.2977609352559454,2.2977609352559454

I had never heard of Clouston until I watched CBC's excellent 1990 documentary that commemorated the 50th anniversary, ""We Shall Fight on the Beaches."" It would be helpful if CBC would make this film available on-line so that Canadians could see for themselves the scale of Clouston's contribution.

Most of my teaching was in ""Section"" programs. By the time the kids got to us they had been through the mill of suspensions, Board special programs, expulsions, CAS and police involvement, etc.

As for your final question, I viewed the central function of our program as precisely that: every student who was with us was not destroying a regular class somewhere else. Whatever learning and improvements that could be achieved in our program were a bonus. 

Generally, almost all of our students settled in and made major gains. But most years there was one kid who, despite everyone's best efforts, persisted with unacceptable behaviour and had to be moved along the continuum of greater restriction/more institutional services.

School hours of 9-3 are an archaic relic of the past, when moms stayed at home and kids worked the farmers' fields.  It creates a whole childcare crisis.  Most parents work 9-5, plus commute time.  In multi-child homes, losing an income is often cheaper than paying childcare.  There isn't enough time to cram in the curriculum, so PE gets cut, and schools rely on parents to help kids with homework.

The solution is to make school hours 8:30-5:30, with a designated hour of PE and a designated hour for kids to complete assignments - with the teacher there to answer questions - and longer recess and lunch breaks.

The biggest opponent of this is the teachers' unions.  They love their cushy 6 hour days while getting paid for 8.5 hours, on a 10 month year with 3 months vacation time.

If  I read my American history correctly the American Catholic Church not only supported the Separation Clause but greatly benefited from it.  The early American Nation was overwhelming and aggressively Protestant and resulted in a vehement anti-Catholic/Papist attitude (the Know-Nothings).  The Catholic Church sought protection of the First Amendment.  Public schools in this era promoted and often mandated prayer which was not challenged by the public and/or courts.  All this changed in the latter part of 19th Century when through IMMIGRATION the Protestant grip over the nation had weakened.  However, Cardinal Gibbons was dismayed by Catholic children in public schools being forced to recite the Protestant version of the Our Father.  Under the Separation Clause Card. Gibbons sought remedy from the courts in which he was unsuccessful.  Thus the birth of the RC schools.",0,-2.280007255656099,2.280007255656099

All of that money will flow directly into our local economy from Broadcom's worldwide sales.  In addition to the payroll, Broadcom will suck down EWEB's power, of which EWEB apparently has too much, and help subsidize the utility for the entire Eugene population.  Also, a plant of Broadcom's size will do substantial local purchasing again pouring cash into the local economy.  If Broadcom is successful and profitable, they will likely double or triple their work force (the plant is big enough).  The bigger the workforce the more money their payroll will dump into the local economy.

About 100 years later, in 1685, a priest Richard Simon, referred to as the ""father of  Critical History"" published his book noting inconsistencies in the OT. His methods were followed by a the Catholic Dr. Jean Astruc, who noted two distinct documents within Genesis.

 Astruc's methods were then used, when German scholors picked up the study. With considerable funding by the German Chancellor Bismark, for his own ends.

The KJV translation of Titus 1:5 has a curious history.  A literal translation form the Greek would be ""establish elders (presbyters)"".  And this it is rendered in almost every language except English.  Why do earlier English Bibles render it ""ordain""?  This goes back to Wycliffe who rendered it ""ordain priests"".

Now any careful reading of the context would show that Paul is talking to Titus about Local Elders.  And the SDA church policy permits both men and women to fill this capacity.

There is absolutely no suggestion here or anywhere else in Paul's writings, that Presbyters have any form of authority beyond their local congregation.

The practice of Plenary (as opposed to local) Ordination of Clergy, which the SDA church has taken from the RCC, arose after the Apostolic era.

I envision this course as one that introduces priests-in-training to the reality of women's lives, particularly desperately poor women in the developing world who daily face the danger that their children will not have enough to eat or will even starve.

There would be a reading list with first-person accounts by women who have eight or ten or thirteen children because their husbands demand their marital rights. These mothers would write of the anguish of seeing their children malnourished or dying because they simply cannot find sufficient food to nourish them.

This dimension of our world --the feminine dimension -- with its perspectives and lives so different from those of future clerics-- is certainly needed in Catholic seminaries.

This is the key challenge and the context which will make a 21st century wordsmithing truly incarnational.
I appreciate the global and galactic  beauty of the words in Fr. Daly's drafts but one of the problems in todays liturgy is the incredible one-sided wordiness, often delivered so badly as to escape any hope of prayerfulness. Too often it is an endurance trial for adults and children.

We are a long way from the intimacy of house churches but somehow we have to reclaim that intimacy and open up to real, not token, involvement. Lately, the liturgical directives are hardening up the boundaries between lay and ordained during Eucharist, ironically re-constructing an invisible but no less divisive ""communion rail"".

Anyway, we do need to remember that somehow everyone is still, supposedly, making a translation from some official and improved LATIN original. 

Is anyone taking a look at what the Latin version says? Is that version reflecting our best  understanding of what we want the Eucharistic Liturgy to teach? If the Latin version is to be the 'official' norm, let' make sure it is a good one that CAN be 'translated' into all the various languages of the world.

Indeed, but with all due respect for Pope Francis, it is time to have an examination of conscience on the issue of excluding women from the sacramental priesthood.  The Vatican ""enlightenment"" in this case is conflated with patriarchal gender ideology, which is becoming increasingly repulsive, not to say obsolete.  As long as the Church is not willing to face this issue with honesty and openness, much harm is being done to the entire body of Christ.  Specifically, religious patriarchy is an obstacle to integral human development and makes it practically impossible to move toward an integral human ecology.

They need to be liberated.

It's becoming clearer and clear that Trump and Clinton will be the two Party nominees.  An independent candidate may impact the election, but will have no chance to win it.  Think of George Wallace, Ross Perot and Ralph Nadar as the most recent examples.  Importantly, Third Party candidates have been to the ""left"" of Democratic candidates or to the ""right"" of Republican candidates. Consequently, they siphon off votes from the candidate they most resemble. If a third party can develop representing a ""centrist"" position, appealing to moderates of both parties, it would be a different thing, 

Meanwhile, in my opinion, as responsible voters we must choose between the two Party nominees........like it or not.",0,-2.211334607463111,2.211334607463111

Even when the prescription is valid, many people do not take the full course of the antibiotic, stopping when they feel better. This leaves strong bacteria unaffected and strengthens the strain. 

Many reputable doctors, scientists, and public policy experts have been warning of over-prescription and misuse of antibiotics for years.",0,-2.1996524066495713,2.1996524066495713

The old bus system cost around $12-13/rider to operate and we are only charging a $2 fare. Some of the low ridership routes were costing more than $30/passenger. Again, not sustainable. 

The lack of riders had has very much to do the very low frequency of most routes. The higher frequency will make it more convenient for more people and decease the amount it has to be subdisized by taxpayers. 

If you include transfer stops, under  the old system many destinations around town would require riders to leave as much as two hours prior to their expected arrival time.

Look at stats last year for passing in the middle of the field and apologize to Green later, the QB was horrible last year stat wise throwing in the middle, where a TE does damage and it's not the TEs fault if you need 11 yards and it's a 7 yard pass that's behind him. Green, good blocker, has only been doing that because of crap O line play.

While Green can block and catch, he can't get separation like Derby can, and Derby will only get better, he came in after the 5th week last year, a full camp will make him the prime target.

There are two sides to the ""go to a church that suits you"" argument. One is that finding another church to attend is seeking your own ways and pursuing sin. The other, which was my experience, was finding spiritual survival and recovery because I was being driven-away from God by the tradition-based form of godliness where the power of God could not be found. I am certain that I would not be an Adventist today if I had stayed there and I likely would have abandoned all faith in God. More than that, I would not have found active, fulfilling ministry in the power of the Holy Spirit and I would not be bringing people into the church. No, it is not ""big tent"" religion that embraces everything sinful, but one where the power of God to redeem ""unto the uttermost"" is ministered to bring sinners to salvation.

However, even if speculators are now often selling to their fellow speculators and driving prices up,  these speculators must feel confident that ultimately there are enough Joe and Josephine Blows out there who aren't speculators and who are willing and able to buy. Once they stop feeling confident about that, their willingness to speculate decreases.  Raising interest rates does make a difference to Joe and Josephine Blow's ability and and willingness to borrow and purchase.",0,-2.142866321736752,2.142866321736752

Dole, a native-born subject of the Hawaiian Kingdom, was a member of the Kingdom legislature and a Justice of the Kingdom's Supreme Court, but resigned before the Hawaiian revolution in order to become President of the Provisional Government and of the Republic of Hawaii.  Sun was present in Hawaii, founding revolutionary societies, raising money, and gathering recruits, at the same time Dole was leading the Hawaiian revolution.

Thanks for that report.  I identify with Pastor Boyd in his spiritual growth from ultra-conservatism to discovering the real power of God in His many expressions of love for us because I have been on a similar path. God's love has taken me from being focused on obeying and defending the Law to wanting to share His amazing, transforming love because of the impact that love has had in me. I no longer just want people to obey God, I want them to love Him so they will want to be with Him.

In his introduction to the book PIONEER WOMEN: VOICES FROM THE KANSAS FRONTIER, historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., remarked, ""Women have constituted the most spectacular casualty of history.""  What women did in American history during America's western frontier---was just not recorded.

The same is true, even more so, in Church history.  Little bits were permitted to be seen, by those recording history [mostly male clergy---monks].  But that is changing, as God works through women and open-minded men.  In his 1963 encyclical Pacem in Terris Pope John XXIII acknowledged and applauded the shift toward recognizing the full humanity of women, which began in the late 19th Century.  He wrote:

BELIEVE IT OR NOT: Under the terms of the settlement, it will be illegal to bring a table to the Wonn Road beach access for a picnic!",0,-2.1220073829712205,2.1220073829712205
7956,"Jagman - the author is quoting averages, citing that the market is too fragmented to deal with the broad range of rates.  You should be very happy to have the rate that you do.

Very interesting that the lower ratio mortgage costs more. Intuitively, you would think it is a lower risk and you would get a better rate.  But the coverage of the higher ratio mortgage with insurance makes the high ratio mortgage less risk for the bank and it costs them less to issue (risk based capital).",0,-2.1219912945959267,2.1219912945959267

Organized labor over the past 100 years or so has positively helped our country, our people and our economy.  I do not believe in absolutes.  ""Any"" implies ""All"".  I won't go there.  

The benefits of past labor organizations is unquestionable; the benefits of SEIU and its brethren are non-existent except to their often captive memberships and are  anti-societal and harmful today for the rest of us.",0,-2.1219866096708158,2.1219866096708158
31817,"In order for there to be a violation there has to be damage, but there is no unlicensed monetary gain, loss of profit to the trademark holder, or weakening of the trademark. If anything they are supporting a licensed product, which is the sort of thing trademark holders love! The idea that this is something that would ever involve a judge is laughable.

As far as ""unauthorized signage on federal property', are you kidding me? Do you think that something like a sign in the breakroom reminding people to clean up after themselves should go through a federal permitting process?

On the other hand, if you do, please feel free to pursue your concerns officially. The news story about it would give a lot of people a good chuckle.",0,-2.121965436401721,2.121965436401721

2) I have yet to figure out how valid those international rankings are.  Nowhere have I ever read the means of comparison.  What test(s) or other criteria are used?
3)  If a test is used, who in our country and who in each of the other countries take said test?  I have never seen any person, be he/she a reporter, feature writer, or woman/man on the street explain how one can compare a USA secondary student with a secondary student in western Europe where the students there are already specializing in their chosen field of study, some as early as our Junior year of high school and where the non-college bound are out of the regular program by about the same time.

6931,"Yes, live life small. In harmony with your neighbors. Like the Euros, or Asians.

Tiptoe through life, kowtow to government. Conform.

Share what you have, do not want more. Nibble, do not bite, at life.

Be fair about it. Why should you have more, when others have less?

Forget about exceptionalism for your nation, conform little people, conform. 

Let government figure out what is best for you. In fact, let the government tell you what you really want. They know best.

Because wanting more, wanting to live life large, that is just so unfair.

Want less. Have less. Share more.

It will all work out for the best. Trust your government. Trust in the collective.

Don't resist. Don't fight it. 

Look how happy the rest of the world is, how well they live. That can be you, in just a few years.
