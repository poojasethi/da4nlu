Individual life exists at the expense of other life. It's in life's nature to consume other life, and about this reality we sing ""O Felix Culpa!""

The sin is out-of-control consumption that mindlessly exploits other life - even to the point of extinction. Out-of-control willfulness is the original and continuing sin of humankind - more aggressive in males than in females.
'APPLE-A-DAY Theology' challenges us to rethink Original Sin and to exercise greater self-control. The population of humankind is in existential crisis because of consumptive excess. Original sin is male-dominant mind to exploit in arrogant self-interest. Can't CHURCHES UNITED agree on the truth of this reality? Where's the HUMility?

I welcome this move.  We will find an answer in the middle.  It will not be in making abortion illegal, especially early term abortions.  It will be in doing more to educate women on contraceptives, doing more to assure women have access to medical professionals for advice and prescriptions that best suit them, in providing women who want to carry a pregnancy to term with the means to do so.  

Make it possible for women to better plan pregnancies and for more women to have the means to make a choice to carry a pregnancy to completion.  Do this and abortions will go down all by themselves.",1,-0.12087495655605318,0.12087495655605318

The thing is, if it can be PROVEN that in fact women have receive Holy Orders in our past, then the argument fails utterly. See my long comment here beginning ""Part 1"" on the evidence. The evidence for early women priests is as of now, to the best of my knowledge, no where near as strong. 

Yes, if women are ordained deacons, there will be a scramble to find new reasons why they can only be deacons and not priests or bishops.

They sometimes behave as cartels by artificially restricting supply to keep demand up and interprovincial barriers.

But if you abolish the OMA who will ensure doctors are qualified and establish best practices? The Provincial governments? That would be equally scary.

I would suggest the best approach is to fix the OMA and include an equal (or greater) number of non-doctors on the board of the OMA, and change the OMA's mandate to aspire to principles of affordable and universal health care.

It is unfair to label LGBT as the critiques of church position, exotic robes, pretentiousness, and sexual function, disfunction or non-function. Why should that community be pliant, patient and understanding when these features of our institution are widely repugnant and at least the subject of disagreement?
It seems that Father Martin wants the LGBT community to follow the ""rest of us"" who have tolerated the exclusion and diminution of women? 
If there is to be a genuine beginning of Catholic community encounter maybe it would be more appropriate for the church to designate unique parish communities to which LGBT are expressly welcomed - that would be a true risk-demonstration.

Really?  Okay - perhaps you prefer the medical terminology.  It is known as ""intact dilation and extraction""or IDX.  But partial birth is an apt description.  Shall we?
""IDX first involves administration of medications to cause the cervix to dilate. Dilation usually occurs over the course of several days. Next, the physician rotates the fetus to a footling breech position. The body of the fetus is then drawn out of the uterus feet first, until only the head remains inside the uterus. The physician then uses an instrument to puncture the base of the skull, which collapses the fetal head. Typically, the contents of the fetal head are then partially suctioned out, which results in the death of the fetus and reduces the size of the fetal head enough to allow it to pass through the cervix. The dead but otherwise intact fetus is then removed from the woman's body.""

Trump and Putin, both outsiders. Though an ex-KGB, the firmly believing Christian was posted mostly away from home by the RDS suspicious of him. While Putin's intimacy with RDS helped him, Trump has no such luck and would not be able to ape him, but he appreciates all the help he gets.

Don Young was the one who voted for repeal of the ACA in the House (not Ohio Dan as I mistakenly stated).  Neither one has offered up any solid constructive plan to replace it.  Don Young offered nothing to protect Alaskans, just defund it to leave millions hanging, and tens of thousands of Alaskans. 
Sullivan has bad-mouthed the ACA plan since it came out, being a good party puppet..so forgive the juxtaposition of your two fellow Trump-train riders.

If it had, late-term abortions and miscarriages would have called for treatment of the well-formed fetus as a person calling for baptism and Christian burial. But this was never the case. The subject of abortion is not scriptural, it is not treated in the Ten Commandments, the Sermon on the Mount, or anywhere in the Jewish Scripture, the New Testament or the creeds and the early ecumenical councils. Augustine? He could never find in Scripture 'anything at all certain about the origins of the soul.' And the most notable Thomas Aquinas, 'lacking scriptural guidance and using Aristotelian distinctions,' denied that personhood arose at fertilization by the semen. God directly infuses the soul at the completion of human formation.""

41105,"I have never run from Hawking's comments.  Evolution is as much a theory as is gravity.   In the past, the official church reacted badly with scientists and Galileo is the text book case.
Hopefully the Church is getting better and wiser in dealing with evolution.

At the end of his popular book, A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME, physicist Stephen Hawking, who sets out the basic structure of the universe, asks a famous question: ""What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe?""  In the integrity of his adherence to atheism, he leaves he question open.

Faith offers a different option, daring to believe that it is God's own Sprit who breathes the fire of life into these equation, indeed, the One who fired up the equations to begin with.

Neither Uranium One nor Russia has a license to export uranium outside the United States, and they'll never get licenses. Russia was likely more interested in Uranium One’s assets in Kazakhstan, the world’s largest uranium producer.

  Your argument doesn't make sense to me. A change in the system requires an unattainable 70%, but a change in government requires only 39%??? You'll never find 70% of people anywhere agreeing on anything.

  The point is, there are always millions of Canadians arguing the legitimacy of every election result. When a party gains ""majority"" power with only 39% of the vote, the other 61% of voters and the millions who chose to withhold their vote because they didn't believe voting would change anything, will always believe their vote doesn't count and never feel democratically represented by government.

  Such an undemocratic lack of representation spreads out to our legal system (the majority can't hire a lawyer), the health care system (millions can't get a doctor or needed health care), the housing system (millions can't afford a house or an adequate apartment), the employment system ( millions suffer a punitive job search),  the justice system, (women sexually assaulted).",1,-0.09982821055097779,0.09982821055097779

Now, due to high levels of immigration, there are large areas dominated by newer socio-ethnic immigrants which creates geographical areas of religious or cultural dominance, where language is used as a barrier, where little integration is taking place. This echoes what is happening in parts of Europe.

I lived in one such area. Every woman's rights in this area were affected as a religion and cultural practice of gender inequality took precedence. Women in public service could not hold meetings because businessmen would not attend them, women were not promoted, women had to be careful what they wore, women had to tolerate being ignored.

2) WW III is a conventional war on the Korean Peninsula and/or Eastern Europe.

I appreciate your thoughtful comments. If you read closely, you'll note I make no defense of the erection of statues or the premise of ""states' rights,' though I am a Federalist and recognize the vast differences about how people in the 19th Century felt about states as opposed to now. My point is that individual liberty allows for context, differences of opinion, and deliberation. I'm not opposed to local communities or elected officials making a decision to move these monuments. What I do reject is the notion that our leaders should make these decisions based on trying to satiate a majoritarian mob. Conservatives (classical Liberals) are absolutely for freedom, liberty and justice for all peoples; but that is not achieved through lawless behavior. 

Our ultimate goal of freedom, liberty and justice for all is best achieved through economic freedom and human flourishing. Such freedom recognizes no color or country or origin. Focusing on identity is counter to our goal.

They make no sense today because we can tell who the father is and the results of these laws are often unfair to men. For example, there are cases where the courts have ordered the presumptive father to pay child support to the mother after she divorced him and married the biological father. That's unfair. 

We've never before had presumptive motherhood laws because everyone knew who the mother was--she's the one who gave birth. Now we do have them. They might work for married female couples but I think they could create havoc for women married to men. 

For example, if a man bears a child by a woman who is not is wife, who is the mother? The woman who gave birth? Or the woman who is married to the father? One has a claim by biology, the other by marital status. So who is the mother? And who decides? The courts? How?

The Church isn't satisfied to persuade women to reject abortion: it lavishes resources on lobbying to coerce women into giving birth. Worse, in the name of ""life,"" the Catholic bishops shilled for perhaps the worst president in American history. For that, I will never return and will fight to the bitter end their crusade to subject women to theocrats.",0,0.07711685678776481,0.07711685678776481
6706,"While I understand that Trudeau must at times find compromises, I disagree with you on this one.

First off, in the case of bitumen, it is actually safer to transport it as a semi-solid via rail or even ship than as a chemically diluted liquid via pipeline. Transported as a semi-solid, any spill is relatively easy to clean up, at least on land or even in a river; nor is it prone to explosions.

Secondly, is it true that ""the oil sands will not, realistically, be shut down""? Certainly this is true in the short term, but as world demand for oil begins to fall (which, if the Paris climate change agreements are implemented, will happen), expensive sources like the oil sands will indeed become stranded assetts. There are already indications that current pipeline capacity may be sufficient. Furthermore, to avoid catastrophic climate change, in the longer term most of the oil sands will simply need to stay in the ground.",1,-0.07710657750921401,0.07710657750921401

<b>Deaconess</b>
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaconess

“<b>Early Christian period</b>
The oldest reference to women as deacons occurs in Paul’s letters (c. AD 55–58). Their ministry is mentioned by early Christian writers such as Clement of Alexandria.[3] and Origen.[4] Secular evidence from the early 2nd century confirms this. In a letter Pliny the Younger attests to the role of the women deacons. Pliny refers to ""two maid-servants"" as deacons whom he tortures to find out more about the Christians. This establishes the existence of the office of the deaconesses in parts of the eastern Roman Empire from the earliest times. Fourth-century Fathers of the Church, such as Epiphanius of Salamis,[5] Basil of Caesarea,[6] John Chrysostom[7] and Gregory of Nyssa[8] accept the ministry of women ordained deacons as a fact.”

No, I'm not say alcohol doesn't have any financial or social cost.  If I wanted to say that I would have. It's not ""my line of argument"" at all. Where'd you get that

You're right, the tax doesn't begin to cover the cost, but the reason you may be correct is this: liquor tax revenues (which are HUGE and ever-growing) aren't funnelled directly into those ""astronomical"" liquor costs.  They go elsewhere. 

I'm interested by the rest of your post.  So, druggies are passive, ""don't fight"" and so, somehow, I take it, they're ""better"" (or maybe, less violent) than those who abuse alcohol? We may be testing that out when millions of pot puffers get behind the wheels of their cars.

Portland is going to have to wake up and accept that the January 2014 Point In Time count that indicated that there were 1,887 unsheltered homeless on any given night in Portland is grossly inaccurate. 

The biggest elephant in Portland's room is that the number of unsheltered in Portland is as high as 12,500. And now that the PBA's law suit has been dismissed, the camping will continue until Ted Wheeler takes office. However, Wheeler is not going to be able to start massive sweeps in January with sub freezing temperatures. 

I predict that the Springwater Corridor homeless tenting/camping will continue until next spring at which time the number of campers will have at least doubled.

The good news is that in January of 2017, a new Point In Time count will be conducted and the Springwater residents can be counted accurately. 

The situation is a big S%*t Sandwich and we all gotta take a bite.

Once the capital is removed from the corporation, it is taxed at the nominal rate. The benefit is that money left in the corporation can be invested and earn additional returns (thus paying additional taxes - capital gains).

I am keenly interested in this subject, but this article disappoints. We all know the sociological perspective--there is broad general agreement that women ought to be deacons, priests, and bishops because the are deserve it because they are fully equal to men. What isn't broadly known is the historical evidence in favour of female deacons.

Perrillos says: ""There is almost no question that female deacons existed in the early church. There is disagreement as to their function..."" Yes, but what the hell does that mean?

The question being asked in Rome by the Commission is whether those known differences in function mean the ""women deacons"" were ""deacons"" in the precise sense of having received the sacrament of Holy Orders, or were they ""deacons"" in some other sense. In RC terms, were those female deacons in major orders, like male deacons, or were they in minor orders.

Wasting life in self-preference over other is antithetical to 'eucharistic mindfulness', of being concerned for other as for self - what is the meaning behind 'Word Unlimited, Divinely Maternal'

Just because the nominal wage, which is what you're referring to, increases does not guarantee that the real wage, the wage after prices have fully adjusted, will increase. The reason for this is that businesses need a way to compensate for the loss in profit. There are two ways they can fix this. 

First, businesses can increase their prices, which will only decrease the consumer's/worker's purchasing power, or the ability to afford a certain amount of goods. Thus, making them worse off. 

Second, businesses can lay off workers and replace them with cheaper technology that can do the same job.

1) Get your fiscal house in order.  Canada and Canadians can not afford the legacy of multi-billion deficits year over year.  The vast majority of so-called investments your government is proposing are nothing of the sort, they are simply program spending with no support for productivity under a different name. 
2) Forget raising taxes, cancel the so-called carbon tax, reinstate the corporate tax cut for business you cancelled and rescind the tax hike for higher income earners.  Under various (provincial and federal) Liberal governments Canada has become a high-cost place to invest.  
3) We need businesses, not the government, to create sustainable jobs that don't rely on government bailouts.

Second, the only areas where oil sands outcrop is where the river valleys incise through the McMurray sands. In the fire area, the oil sands are well below surface.
Third, dry peat burns very well. The English and Germans discovered this hundreds of years ago and harvested peat for heating. No oil sands in sight there.

1) The socio-economic ladder is very hierarchical, sharply and deeply divided by cl;ass. 
That's the way the 1% and governments want it. It makes people work harder to scratch their way up the ladder.

2 )When one demographic, like women, for example, came up the ladder in the 70's and 80's, the poor and minimum wage workers got pushed further down. Welfare was cut to the bone, minimum wage remained unlivable.

3) When women and ethnic immigrants and many other Canadians moved up the ladder in the 80's and 90's, the poor and workers got pushed down further into deeper poverty. The poor and homeless took the place of the other groups as scapegoats.

His first travel ban on Muslims was overturned by the Supreme Court. He has yet to address campaign promises on tax reform or the building of the wall. And, his effort to reform/repeal Obamacare has been rejected in Congress by his fellow Republicans.

His only success is having filled the Supreme Court vacancy with Judge Neil Gorsuch, thus ensuring a Conservative court for at least the next 20 to 25 years.
Amazingly, Trump has managed to keep his head above water. However, things may be about to change.
September will see Trump asking Congress to raise the US debt ceiling. That will see stiff resistance from Dems and hard line Republicans.

I had two brilliant priests in college for Catholic philosophy, Logic and epistemology. WE used Maritains book for the two philosophy courses and I don't recall what books we used for the other two courses.
In the first philosophy course we learned the Catholic tenet that one cannot use ignoble means to achiev3e ones goals, no matter the goal. We asked the priest why? He said because by doing that one is increasing the weight of evil in the world. So we asked: what is one to do then about important goals. The priest said: one must use ones God given higher order brain to come up with a way to achieve ones goal.

He also said, ""if thine eye offend thee pluck it out, etc."" There is no record of the majority of early Christians being blind amputees.
Christ's words to the Pharisees questions on matrimony were specific and direct and it is impossible to interpret them any other way than rejecting the Mosaic indulgence.

For example, in a system where equal rights are sustained, why are women with children denied of such a service? Yes, because it would be too expensive to house women with children. That alone violates equal opportunity. There are services available to women who are victims of abuse.

But either way, the crux of what I said remains intact; those who were legally in possession of firearms at the Walmart, acted absolutely correct; none fired any rounds and they were most disciplined. Sadly, law enforcement is never there when many of these shootings go down, it's almost an impossibility, thus leaving people present to their own to fend for themselves, often resulting in much higher numbers killed and injured. 
A law abiding citizen, one familiar, knowledgeable, and proficient with firearms, disciplined as these people were, should have that right and choice.

One of the great things about Catholicism is that most Catholics, even many priests, be they conservative or liberal, have an earthy appreciation for the vagaries of the human condition and a great tolerance for people who are plugging along, doing the best they can.  And that's most of us, gay, straight or whatever.

Now to digress a bit further:
The Sadducee's, and in as much as the Pharisee's, did not believe Jesus was truly the Son of God. So, in comparison to why we don't make woman Deacons, falls in line with why Jesus didn't discontinue living fully as He was and is God's only begotten Son, even to the point of death.  Likewise, the Church does not lay the Diaconate upon woman as much as Christ did not remain undetermined as the Son of God. And so, there's no tolerance to something that isn't true.

To ask the Church to be contrary to a so-called male hierarchy of establishment - since Jesus, the Word of God, came incarnate as True God and True man - would then also presume to deny Jesus as truly the Son of God.
