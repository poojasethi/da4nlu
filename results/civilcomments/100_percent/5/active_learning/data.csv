Imagine that the white supremacists had their protest in one park, while those opposed had their protest in another park a few blocks over, standing up against hatred.  Today, we'd be talking about how the white supremacists looked like complete idiots and how reasonably the protesters responded.

Instead, some of the protesters went looking for a fight, the situation escalated, a nutbar lost his cool, and today we're talking about deaths while the extreme right postures about the loss of free speech.

A pedestrian has the right to cross the road when their light turns green.  But it is poor judgement to cross without looking anyway, or to assume a vehicle approaching at speed will stop.  It is unwise to place oneself in such danger just because one has the right.

During the campaign an open-minded non-Catholic had no doubt which side the bishops as a group were taking, even though most bishops did not campaign openly for Mr. Trump. Now some bishops regret their support for Mr. Trump, but it seems to me that the primary reason is that Catholic Hispanics face deportation. So have the bishops really had a change of heart? Their concern for the Affordable Care Act now is hypocritcal since earlier they gave legitimacy to those who attacked this law by their own unreasonable attacks on the law, both in the courts and in the fortnight for freedom. They have lost a tremendous amount of credibility with their implicit support of Trump's election, and that after the sex abuse fiasco!

A more  accurate analysis of the 2016 presidential election than the preliminary exit polls shows that Hillary Clinton won the Catholic vote, so now I’m waiting for the spate of stories about how the Democratic Party should stop worrying about courting religious voters and hold strongly to its pro-choice position.

Clinton won the Catholic vote by 48% to 45% for Trump, according to an analysis of data from the nonpartisan American National Elections Studies by Georgetown University’s Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate. That’s compared to exit poll data that suggested Trump won the Catholic vote by 52% to 45%.

To your point, something I'd like to see is the offence that the inmates are in for and see how that breaks down along racial lines. In other words, are non-white folks in jail for violent crimes more often than white folks? If so that would suggest a correlation between violent crimes and use of force -- people who commit violence are more likely to be targets of force in jail.

LAS VEGAS—In the hours following a violent rampage in Las Vegas in which a lone attacker killed more than 50 individuals and seriously injured 400 others, citizens living in the only country where this kind of mass killing routinely occurs reportedly concluded Monday that there was no way to prevent the massacre from taking place. “This was a terrible tragedy, but sometimes these things just happen and there’s nothing anyone can do to stop them,” said Iowa resident Kyle Rimmels, echoing sentiments expressed by tens of millions of individuals who reside in a nation where over half of the world’s deadliest mass shootings have occurred in the past 50 years and whose citizens are 20 times more likely to die of gun violence than those of other developed nations.

If chemical weapons had some magic effect that furthered  the war effort against the killer rebs, then I could buy Assad using them.  But they don't.  They are just no better than firebombs or high explosive bombs.  The killer rebs on the other hand are desperate for western support.

The connection between ""control over global Catholic assets"" and the lack of accountability for hierarchs and priests cannot be overstated.  The mountains money the hierarchs control has funded all the hush money, all the lawyers and public relations consultants, all the political cover from law enforcement.

If Catholics take away hierarchs access to $billions, their hearts and minds will soon follow.  Right now, all bishops - under the legal precept of ""corporation sole"" - control all money and property of every diocese and every parish, including the salaries and health care of all priests [which hierarchs in turn use to intimidate priests into silence, obedience and complicity].  

Catholics must break these chains the hierarchs have to hold our priesthood and the People hostage to their political hegemony over the rest of the church.

6829,"Interesting workup.  Wrong conclusion, I think.

Craig Medred has been following a data string that suggests there are too many hatchery pinks released in the North Pacific.  They are voracious feeders that out compete other salmon species - king, silver, chum and red - for what is naturally found in the ocean.  It may explain the awful king and silver returns the last decade.  And the hatchery pinks benefit commercial fishermen.

So if this is a problem, how do you solve it?  One way would be to start raising commercial pinks via aquaculture - fish farming - in their own pens so they aren't out in the open out competing other species for available food in the wild.

Somewhere along the line, we are going to have to get a handle on precisely what the carrying capacity (total number of feeding salmon) of the North Pacific actually is.  I don't mind commfish making a living.  I do mind them destroying everyone else's access to fish in order to make that living.  Cheers -",0,0.14006035110531023,0.14006035110531023

But it gets worse than that, because those who feel they have been slighted by history over the decades demand equal time and/or revisionism.  It might have been grossly unfair, but power belonged to white English speaking males, and history is made by those who have power.  The others have insufficient influence over events.

""The finding that only 28% of the female offenders in the Quebec sample had previously been subjected to violence by their victim is in contrast to the popular belief and reports that indicate that most female-perpetrated spousal homicide occurs in self-defense or in reaction to long-term abuse. In fact, women rarely gave a warning before killing their mates. Most did not suffer from a mental illness, although one-fifth were acutely intoxicated at the time of the killing. In the vast majority of cases of women who killed their mates, there were very few indicators that might have signaled the risk and helped predict the violent lethal behavior.""",0,-0.13417312267824744,0.13417312267824744

Other psychologists also want to list nomophobia, fear of being without your cell phone and without constant contact with other people, as a mental disorder.

And Catholics are obliged to believe literally in things that aren't even in the Bible: that Jesus founded a church, that he invented the Eucharist at the last supper, that he thought the church needed a Pope and decided Peter was the best man for the job, and that he somehow made them all ontologically superior to the rest of humanity.

Just the fact that they felt they couldn't leave and seek help says volumes about their lack of self esteem and the resulting learned helplessness.  That they didn't know their address is also telling.

Children can be fed, clothed and sheltered well, taken to the doctor, not beaten and sent to school and still suffer from emotional neglect that might require years of therapy to mitigate.  Even the children themselves may not understand what went wrong in their lives.  But as grown ups, problems in relationships and in their own feelings will shout about ""something"" being wrong.  It's called benign neglect. 

So these poor girls have experienced both active and benign neglect which will take a great deal of kind, thoughtful help to begin to correct.  New laws must be crafted to address what isn't an entirely isolated incident.

""Emancipation enslaves everybody, not just blacks.""

--

Do you understand what the word ""emancipation"" means?

General meaning: 

""the fact or process of being set free from legal, social, or political restrictions; liberation""

Historical meaning in US history:

""On January 1, 1863, Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. The declaration reads, 'all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free.' In other words, slaves in the Confederate states were pronounced free by the Emancipation Proclamation.""

As a journalism major, I learned that one of the central functions of a free press is to decide what gets attention, as you said, to set the agenda. That was in the early 80s. Television had not yet reached the pervasive level of influence that it has today. So yes, the press bears a responsibility for perpetuating the misogyny that is still rampant in our society.

Well, I'm only a Christian in the Jeffersonian sense.  Great man, not God.

But I have been on the business end of our guns.  I was a top level Vietnamese Linguist in Military Intelligence, and I spent a year talking to Vietnamese (both North and South), and reading their personal letters, diaries, notebooks and poetry.  They were nationalists and patriots fighting for the independence of their country, but did not want Communism.  Not even the NVA, but the Communists took over their movement and sent them to slaughter.  Had we been ""allowed"" to win by LBJ and the Democrats, by going into Hanoi and taking out the leaders, instead of killing the innocents sent to war, we would have rebuilt their country and given it back to them like we did Japan.

That we abandoned them to Communism is a disgrace.  That's not what they wanted.  Still isn't.",0,0.09334973250001788,0.09334973250001788

It is hard not to feel a deep and long-running stream of misogyny in the effort to assert control over this most distinctly female power.

Rasmea Yousef Odeh, a convicted terrorist. Odeh, a Palestinian, was convicted in Israel in 1970 for her part in two terrorist bombings, one of which killed two students while they were shopping for groceries. She spent 10 years in prison for her crimes. She then managed to become a US citizen in 2004 by lying about her past (great detective work, INS: Next time, use Google) but was subsequently convicted, in 2014, of immigration fraud for the falsehoods. However, she won the right to a new trial (set for this spring) by claiming she had been suffering from PTSD at the time she lied on her application. Oh, and in her time as a citizen, she worked for a while as an ObamaCare navigator.

Answer: by their Arab League leaders and imams, who rejected the Partition Plan (which gave the Arabs the majority of British Mandate Palestine) and urged local Arabs to get out of the way, to facilitate invasion -- using a combination of scare-tactic lies about Jews coming to massacre them and tantalizing promises of sweet pickings after the combined Arab armies overran and cleared the fledgling Jewish State.

     Notably, during the same post-1948 period, 800,000+ Jews had to flee their homes in Arab lands after the founding of the State of Israel; countries they had called ""home"" for centuries. They, too, were refugees. But they moved on.",0,0.04445839110394645,0.04445839110394645

The first three of these [witnesses], all from conservative organizations that advocate for broad religious exemptions, pushed a narrative of religious persecution fueled by several fundamental misrepresentations: first, that efforts to combat anti-LGBTQ discrimination, or to provide access to contraception, constitute malicious anti-Christian harassment rather than attempts to expand access to jobs, services, housing, and health care; second, that groups seeking anti-LGBTQ and anti-choice exemptions want merely to “live-and-let-live” when in fact many of these organizations have consistently sought to ban LGBTQ relationships and abortion; and third, that issues around sex, marriage, and reproduction constitute the primary site for religious liberty disputes in the current political climate.

You attempt the scare tactic of ""Your child might get an abortion behind your back"". Is your argument so weak that you have to rely on scare tactics?

You do know that abortion is in the bible with the lord stating that a woman who is believe to have cheated should drink the bitter water and abort the baby. Even the bible speaks of abortion and not in a negative way, it was endorsed by god. So religion is not an excuse for your behavior.

Again, if you don't want an abortion, don't have one. Beyond that, perhaps you should not judge women and let others make their own medical choices.",0,0.03282054393048317,0.03282054393048317

No. In truth, we'd have to admit that we had given cause to suspect Catholicism as nurturing terrorists, and suspect Catholics of harboring them. And at some point, to protect Catholicism slander, we would rise up and proclaim very loudly, in large numbers and as ostentatiously as possible, that we Catholics do not tolerate such violence. If we failed to do that, we would understand that our silence amounts to condonation. Why, then, do we not demand the same of Muslims?

It is outrageously funny to ascribe any sense of global fairness to any of China's motives.

That nation has historically been obsessively inward looking and dismissive of foreigners, to the point of overt racism.

Good luck to those nations hitching their wagon to the Chinese Express: ""America first"" will seem like a universal declaration of human solidarity in comparison to what Beijing would have in store for the rest of the world.

Trump, for all his clumsiness, has publicly exposed the great Chinese deception: using stolen technology and intellectual property, they seek to set up a new hegemony. And, if a few crumbs fall from the table, the Chinese won't mind too much if some of their vassal slave states gobble them up.

That's to cover the estimated 29-129 service members who would seek the treatment yearly. It's rational to ask, is that additional cost worth the small number of soldiers gained from it? While that matter is being studied it's reasonable to put a hold on transgender people joining the US military. And that's what Trump did. 

It's also reasonable to assume that, as did 18 other countries including Canada, the US military will conclude that allowing transgendered people to serve does not seriously impact the force's ability to function.

And then, near the end of the piece, he hints at the actual crux of the matter, which is that Singh is a devout Sikh whose religiously-grounded social values infuse his policy choices, such as his opposition to Ontario's new sex-ed curriculum. This, I believe, is the problem with displaying religiosity in politics as it implies that church and state can't and won't be separated by fundamentalist politicians. Canada is mainly a socially progressive country, where religious fundamentalism is distrusted. Even Harper had to keep his party's Christian social conservatives out of the spotlight to gain and hold power. So maybe Quebec's leftists aren't particularly different from most voters in the rest of Canada in their perspective on religion in politics.

5) Destroy traditional Canadian communities, values, and working class solidarity with perpetual multicultural and religious conflicts.

Most Alaskan's I know could care less about what someone's personal business is unless it brings harm to others. Certainly the LGBT community doesn't. Kelly doesn't really care that Phoenix is transgender. Neither do the rest of them. What they are worried about is losing a slice of their power & control and they think Phoenix might be the guy to do it. My concern? I could care less that he's transgender either. What I care about is that Phoenix has been in the state for a relatively short time and prior to being here was a pastor. His skill set might be great for that, but how is he qualified to be a commissioner of the Alaska State Human Rights Commission? My other concern is he was picked by Walker.
