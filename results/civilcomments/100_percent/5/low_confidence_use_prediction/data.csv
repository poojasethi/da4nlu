But as I grew older and became more critically aware, that changed. When they need to ditch the devil's advocate in order to let certain people become saints, I begin to think that agendas are being foisted upon us. JPII had a long standing inappropriate relationship with a married woman (certainly inappropriate for a Pope!), he covered up the global sexual abuse of children, warmly welcomed brown envelopes from the likes of Marcel Maciel, gave special prelatures to rich conservatives, refused to support real saints like Dom Helder Camara and Oscar Romero (with tragic results for the latter), and let Ratzinger loose on the Church where they both set about dismantling the work of revered Pope John XXIII.

For instance, Pope John Paul never explicitly invoked infallibility to shore up his teaching about the ordination of women; neither did Pope Benedict.

My argument, which I didn't have enough characters in my last comment to fully develop, is basically that the role of the fully-informed human conscience should reign supreme in such matters. Now I'm aware of the fact that the bishops would say that a fully-informed conscience can never dissent from official church teaching. I'm in fundamental disagreement with them on that, and you can either agree with me or not that that's a valid position to hold. The fact remains that I hold it on a number of issues. So, to answer your question, the applicability of church teaching is not as important to me as the demands of my own conscience. I think the church always wants to make official teaching neat and clean on issues that are inherently messy. I believe that sometimes it's better to learn to live with paradox than avoid it.

Love is an act of the will, a sacrifice for the good of another.  The costlier & more cheerful the sacrifice the more we take on the image of Jesus.  Church teaching. 

It's why we hang the simple compact image of the Crucifix in our home, office, bedroom: to help us to love as Jesus loved.

The love that man has for his wife should ""converge"" on the image of Jesus's love on the Cross.  And his wife should self-empty for her husband's greatest good in the same way.

So when one considers this deeper more demanding definition of love, it becomes clear why the love of the priest has for the Church ""becomes"" very similar to the love that a spouse has for each other.

Many married couples in fact don't understand what's demanded in them in the Sacrament of Holy Orders:  total self gift for the good of the other.

This has to be the beginning from which we assess a relationship, not a fore ordained assumption that the reason for marriage is lust or sinfulness.
IOW, we cant take our interpretation of our memories of what Christ said and use them as a reason to ignore the love that Christ gives us today.

It appears to me, however, that those trapped in the hierarchicalism, legalism & rigorism repudiated by the Pope, likely lacked the theological imagination required to benevolently interpret it, precisely because the logical legacy of those -isms lead to fraught tautological terms, wherein one's conclusions are already embedded, and to invalid premises, fatally flawed by category errors, like conflations of moral & prudential judgments, or of divine & natural law with positive laws, church & public.

So it follows that it can only be 'merciful' to open Communion up to the divorced-and-remarried, and indeed (following the logic further) to all comers.
While we can't expect to hammer out a complete Eucharistic theology in a combox, I'd suggest this view is in many ways deficient.

We have anthropomorphized God into a male figure, calling him ""Father"" and always referring to hir as ""him."" When we do this we also attribute to God male human roles, roles borne out of human evolution, history, and culture.  

I understand Pan's point, but I think it is important that we recognize that the maleness of Jesus was beside the point of Hir Incarnation.  Jesus was God become human; God is neither male nor female. The immortal spirit of God that took on flesh in Jesus was neither male nor female.  His maleness was immaterial to his Godhead.  

It isn't that Jesus being male is not real.  But because he was male, must we assume that signifies some preference of God for male priests or males as leaders over females?  Or is that assumption borne out of human culture? What is of God and what of man?",1,1.7884804784060298,1.7884804784060298

Since you are citing the Gospel of Matthew, how about Chapter 25:31-47?  This is called the Judgment of the Nations.  In it Jesus describes HIS role at the end of time.  What it states is that ANYONE who has personally cared for others---giving them food, water, clothing, visiting them in prison, or when they were sick---will inherit the kingdom prepared for them by the Father.

This clearly states that ANYONE----of any religion, or any culture who does this----is welcomed into heaven.  Why doesn't the official church [hierarchy] stress this as divine command?

For example, for January Ontario saw 2.3% year-over-year inflation vs. 1.3% in Quebec and 2.1% in Manitoba.  Of course there is a lot of variation and other reasons why inflation might be lower or higher in any given month, hence why averaging out over a longer of period of time can help ""smooth things out"".

Sill it is not unreasonable to guess that Ontario's Cap 'n Trade added maybe 0.6 percentage points to inflation, averaging inflation here vs. Manitoba and Quebec.  So if your family's after-tax income is $50,000/year the cap'n'trade tax might be costing you about $300/year?

The dubia suggest that “Amoris Laetitia” has brought change or novelty to traditional Catholic teaching. Repeatedly, whether in the context of “Amoris Laetitia” itself or other discourses, the pope has affirmed that there is no new teaching and no change in the teaching. If this is so, what would be the origin of the dubia?

I propose that the dubia stem from a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of “Amoris Laetitia” and, indeed, of the renewal that began with the Second Vatican Council and was fostered by John Paul II—including his encyclical “Veritatis Splendor.”

 Things are very different now & new parameters must be employed. In the past there were no large bureaucracies anxious to add to new clients to the welfare roles. In fact immigrants -like citizens - had to fend for themselves.

Rather, as an English rendering of a Latin rendering of the Greek 'homo-ousios', it seems intended to distinguish appearance from less aparent reality (i.e. Jesus' appearance as distinct from the Father, whereas he is, in reality, one with the Father).

But in this instance, even more so, I see the irrelevance of changing 'one in being' to the less intelligible 'consubstantial'. At least if we were distinguishing between 'one in being' and one in substantial form (Aristotelian), we would be sacrificing one kind of clarity for another. Here, they are only sacrificing intelligibility so that the replacement English word 'consubstantial' will sound more like the Latin 'consubstantialem'.

Truer than you might have imagined.  Actually NOBODY was ""ordained"" in the NT.  The word does not appear there in the context of religious actions or ceremonies.  It was introduced after the NT era, from Roman civil custom.

Ordination as a doctrine does not exist in the SDA church because it does not exist in the Bible.  So the entire question about Principles vs Policies vs Practices must be argued from Biblical and historical precedents, rather than a ""thus saith the Lord"".

Historically, Ordination began as a Practice and then became regulated by Policy (ordaining women was first forbidden a couple centuries after the Apostles died), and was later elevated to a Principle in the RC Sacrament of Holy Orders.

If the process of Reformation all the way back to Apostolic times, which Adventists proclaim, is to run to fruition, then this history of Ordination needs to be reversed.",1,1.740569141167795,1.740569141167795

Sorry, but Church history shows that you are incorrect here.  People didn't just believe that folks came to believe that Jesus was divine as quickly as you may have assumed.  

The First Ecumenical Council of Nicaea [325] tackled issues that were more difficult than you are highlighting.  The question that the great theologian Arias was posing was that ONLY the Father was un-begotten, and that Jesus was created.  Arius DID BELIEVE that Jesus as SON possessed a dignity superior to everyone else.  Arius was very persuasive among the Greek bishops.  Since the unity of Christianity was at stake here, the Emperor Constantine was hoping for someone to come forward with a solution to the problem.  A solution came from a bright young deacon attending the council, whose name was Athanasius.  Athanasius believed that an article of faith was needed and then he presented three concepts that the Council Fathers could accept 1) The Son was 'homoiousious' 'of like substance with the Father.",1,1.7202072616811233,1.7202072616811233

Please supply chapter and verse.

But I would love to be contradicted on this specific (double) point. Can anyone correct me? Once I receive such I shall obviously withdraw my comments.

Can anyone provide me with other examples of Pope Francis engaging openly in the last 4 or more years of his pontificate with anyone who dared to disagree?  Again, I look forward to a list of examples.

We are in the position of a little child, entering a huge library whose walls are covered to the ceiling with books in many different tongues. The child knows that someone must have written those books. It does not know who or how. It does not understand the languages in which they are written. The child notes a definite plan in the arrangement of the books, a mysterious order, which it does not comprehend, but only dimly suspects. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of the human mind, even the greatest and most cultured, toward God. We see a universe marvelously arranged, obeying certain laws, but we understand the laws only dimly. Our limited minds cannot grasp the mysterious force that sways the constellations..."".

This demands journalistic integrity which begins when an editor assigns a journalist to cover a specific topic and that journalist following through with due diligence in the form of researching the topic and then going out into the field to gather facts from which the journalist constructs a ""story"" which presents those facts in a fair and unbiased way, bereft of opinion.

Yet sometimes a story fairly begs for coverage without any interest from media.

The delay is enough to make the sound garbled.

I think it would be better to build a sound wall about halfway  in the row of pews in the building and ask that people sit in the front half of the church, not in the back as many seem to prefer.

He followed the same revolutionary career path as another Punahou student had followed 18 years previously:  Sanford B. Dole, a native-born subject of the Hawaiian Kingdom, was a member of the Kingdom legislature and a Justice of the Kingdom's Supreme Court, but resigned before the Hawaiian revolution in order to become President of the Provisional Government and of the Republic of Hawaii.  Sun was present in Hawaii, founding revolutionary societies, raising money, and gathering recruits, at the same time Dole was leading the Hawaiian revolution.

This is the key challenge and the context which will make a 21st century wordsmithing truly incarnational.
I appreciate the global and galactic  beauty of the words in Fr. Daly's drafts but one of the problems in todays liturgy is the incredible one-sided wordiness, often delivered so badly as to escape any hope of prayerfulness. Too often it is an endurance trial for adults and children.

We are a long way from the intimacy of house churches but somehow we have to reclaim that intimacy and open up to real, not token, involvement. Lately, the liturgical directives are hardening up the boundaries between lay and ordained during Eucharist, ironically re-constructing an invisible but no less divisive ""communion rail"".

All good points and I feel for you. As I mentioned elsewhere, specialized programs are expensive but when they work they can be a money-saver in the long run. 
Most of my teaching was in ""Section"" programs. By the time the kids got to us they had been through the mill of suspensions, Board special programs, expulsions, CAS and police involvement, etc.

As for your final question, I viewed the central function of our program as precisely that: every student who was with us was not destroying a regular class somewhere else. Whatever learning and improvements that could be achieved in our program were a bonus. 

Generally, almost all of our students settled in and made major gains. But most years there was one kid who, despite everyone's best efforts, persisted with unacceptable behaviour and had to be moved along the continuum of greater restriction/more institutional services. Two or three others shaped up and began integration back to the regular stream.",1,1.6222302082796156,1.6222302082796156

The creation of a law which presumes to read people's minds is not fair nor just because, people simply cannot read other people's minds.  We see in this discussion that many are willing to impute intent with absolutely no concrete evidence except for the fact that an arrest was made.  Thus the fact of an arrest rather than meaningful ""evidence"" of the workings within a person's mind is sufficient for a conviction.  Now it is clear that what I see as just or fair is of no consequence.  Our criminal justice system is profoundly unfair in so many ways.  It's okay, the lives of the high schoolers will be ruined by this but who cares.

According to the Independent Electricity System Operator, nuclear provided 60% of all electricity consumed in Ontario in 2015.  Hydro provided 24%. Renewables provided less than 8%.

As for costs, the Ontario Energy Board reports that in its regulated price plan for 2014 to 2015 that each unit of hydro generation cost 5.,1 c/kWhr. Nuclear cost 5.9 c/kWhr.  Wind was more than double these rates at 12.3 c/kWhr. As for solar--out of sight at 47.6c/kWhr.

So Mr Dogterom is right on one thing: the numbers don't lie. What the numbers tell us however is that nuclear and hydro generation provide Ontario consumers with low-cost, carbon-free electricity.

As long as the Church is not willing to face this issue with honesty and openness, much harm is being done to the entire body of Christ.

China has 2BN people and will spend $300BN on energy.  India must be doing that too!!  Well, no.  India generates very little power for a nation of 2BN people, mostly from coal like China.  The difference is India will be adding generating power, both coal and renewables from a very low base.  China will be converting away from coal.  It is not the same thing.

Use of renewables does require storage solutions to take full advantage.  All of these are either experimental or (batteries) very expensive.  You can purchase a Tesla storage solution for home.

I think perhaps Pope Francis is trying to teach us that life is more nuanced, more complicated than that - that gray areas do in fact exist and that we should all learn to become more comfortable with them. Alas, some people are having none of it. To my mind, one of the best lines in Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" is when Gandalf says to Frodo Baggins, ""Even the very wise cannot see all ends.""

Francis lives that discernment, so I just assume that the cautious path he is leading us down is precisely the way the Spirit is calling him. A radical progressive pope imposing his own will on the Church would be just as destructive as JP2, a radical conservative pope who did impose his will on us, because he believed in V1 not V2. Both lead to schism. Francis is NOT leading us on a middle course between the two, but rather is setting the scene for acceptance of and comfort with open, substantial disagreement, and that is the arena in which the Spirit can do her thing best.

Not all condo rental activity serves the ordinary local rental housing markets in places like Vancouver and Toronto.",1,1.5388125067515226,1.5388125067515226

The KJV translation of Titus 1:5 has a curious history.  A literal translation form the Greek would be ""establish elders (presbyters)"".  And this it is rendered in almost every language except English.  Why do earlier English Bibles render it ""ordain""?  This goes back to Wycliffe who rendered it ""ordain priests"".

Now any careful reading of the context would show that Paul is talking to Titus about Local Elders.  And the SDA church policy permits both men and women to fill this capacity.

There is absolutely no suggestion here or anywhere else in Paul's writings, that Presbyters have any form of authority beyond their local congregation.

The practice of Plenary (as opposed to local) Ordination of Clergy, which the SDA church has taken from the RCC, arose after the Apostolic era.

Based only on his public image and statements, I think there are two crucial observations. 

First, he is adamant to actualize the eccesiology of V2, which P6, JP2 and P16 have systematically ignored, preferring V1. Second, he is utterly focused on a Christianity of service of others. The latter is, I think, both an expression of his own enormous heart and a conscious decision to point forward in a direction the neither side can gainsay. And this is the characteristic that seems to make him adorable to just about anyone of good will.

But in the longer term, IMHO, it is the first propensity that is most important. Given our history from at least Trent, it is absolutely astonishing that Francis demands open discussion among bishops as V2 presumed.

School hours of 9-3 are an archaic relic of the past, when moms stayed at home and kids worked the farmers' fields.  It creates a whole childcare crisis.  Most parents work 9-5, plus commute time.  In multi-child homes, losing an income is often cheaper than paying childcare.  There isn't enough time to cram in the curriculum, so PE gets cut, and schools rely on parents to help kids with homework.

The solution is to make school hours 8:30-5:30, with a designated hour of PE and a designated hour for kids to complete assignments - with the teacher there to answer questions - and longer recess and lunch breaks.

The biggest opponent of this is the teachers' unions.  They love their cushy 6 hour days while getting paid for 8.5 hours, on a 10 month year with 3 months vacation time.

Of course, there are other reasons, everyone is different, but surely to say so does not constitute Revisionism.

That's incorrect. There's nothing about either sympathy or compassion that requires taking a side. 

The taking of sides is a strategic act, typically informed by both cognitive and emotional factors. Once a side is chosen, it tends to interfere with normal feelings of empathy and compassion. For example, when a player on the opposing team is injured, you're less likely to feel empathy for him than you would if it was a player on the team you support.

At least from a Buddhist's point of view, compassion can take no side. It's not an emotion. It's a state of being that's given freely to every living thing, without moralizing or politicizing the circumstances. Empathy on the other hand is an emotional connection between you and someone else, typically due to difficult circumstances the other is experiencing.",1,1.4969392657562501,1.4969392657562501

About 100 years later, in 1685, a priest Richard Simon, referred to as the ""father of  Critical History"" published his book noting inconsistencies in the OT. His methods were followed by a the Catholic Dr. Jean Astruc, who noted two distinct documents within Genesis.

 Astruc's methods were then used, when German scholors picked up the study. With considerable funding by the German Chancellor Bismark, for his own ends.

In this particular case, I believe the thrust of the Catholic position has been consistent--life in the womb, whenever and however that was understood to begin at different times in our history, is sacred, and not to be violated--regardless of lack of scriptural warrant.

First, not all residents drive; those of us who don't pay for this resource too. Second, the street parking is still there, you just have to compete with more people for it. Which is what you should expect from a scarce, underpriced resource!

Our Protestant roots are planted in an anti-hierarchical notion of our personal relationships to God and our individual responsibilities to act on our own moral codes (of course, this causes [almost] as much trouble as it avoids because it also allows for idiosyncratic processing of scripture).  High-context social systems will always be différèrent from low-context ones, and religions that emerge from cold climates different from those from the warmer ones.  Some of this is incorrigible, and no theological conclusion is likely to override (at least) five thousand years of cultural development.

Indeed a study was done under P6 and then, as you say, that study was suppressed.

George Montimort, whose views are available in English as ""Deaconesses: An Historical Study, 1986.""

John Elway was fortunate that the Broncos had a terrible record in 2010, because in the 2011 draft, he was able to select Von Miller, who has been the leader of Denver's defense.  Elway has done remarkably well drafting defensive players.  And the 2012 Ravens, who won Super Bowl 47, proved that you can win a Super Bowl with a not quite elite QB if your defense is solid.

I'm not one to understand prophesies, but if memory serves, sometimes they come out in ways that we don't expect.

Given the numbers who have left, or who stayed but effectively ""checked out,"" and the impact this will have on long term church demographics,  and the effective loss of trust in the institution triggered by the bishops, it may well be that Malachy could be correct, even if there are future popes.

But at the same time on of the whole points of accumulating wealth and having a good income is so that you have greater freedom to indulge in those possessions and activities that give you pleasure.

It is quite possible to live a comfortable lifestyle that includes some indulgences without putting your finances at risk or raising entitled kids.  We watch our spending as well - in part so that we can enjoy the nicer things in life.

South Waterfront provides all these alternatives to the max. But recent studies shows that less than 7% of all trips are by these modes.

""the sharing or exchanging of intimate thoughts and feelings, especially on a mental or spiritual level.""

I understand that the latter adjectival phrase communicates, more intelligibly than the former adjective, that Jesus is united to the Father in a way that no creature is. Moreover, by means of Aristotelian metaphysical terminology, 'consubstantial' intends to communicate that Jesus' substantial form is that of the Father's, whereas ours is that of creation. 

The adjectival phrase 'one in being', I argue, communicates the distinction of Jesus from the rest of humankind, as the Nicaean and Constantinopolitan creeds intended. The adjective 'consubstantial' does the same, albeit in a vocabulary foreign to all individuals, praying in the English language, who are not familiar with Aristotelian metaphysical co-principles, such as matter and form.

From within Seventh-day Adventism, then, what is the job the vast majority of Seventh-day Adventist church members continue to hire the church to do for them?

The church has taken great effort to make this clear.

As a condition of baptism into the salvation defined by the church, the church requires people to publically confirm their determination to remain true to the published fundamental beliefs of the church, the church having self-defined itself as ‘God’s highest authority on earth’ pending the return of Jesus.

To change the church structure thus calls into question the validity of its creed and thus the spiritual security of its members.

In the Catholic Church, merit is not a function of office., office is a function of merit.  In other words--a bishop's consecration and ordination is what qualifies them to be the teacher of the Faith, not their academic credentials.

The whole problem with dissenting theologians is precisely that they do not understand their proper role.  The role of the theologian is to show how what the Church teaches is contained in the sources of revelation.

Clement of Rome pegged it for some time in November (Jesus was a Scorpio!) Hippolytus didn't have a particular date, but he was sure it was a Wednesday.  Shepherds would not have been in the field with their flocks in the middle of winter (it snows in Israel during the winter,) and pilgrims would not have made the trek to complete the supposed census in the harsh conditions of winter.  Some contemporary scholars suggest September, based on the supposed date of John's birth, etc.  Point is, Christmas is a bit of a historical mystery, but I guess that doesn't matter to those who want life time-warped back to the 1950's.

It was ONLY after the persecutions---that the groups of Christians all around the Middle East and the Mediterranean, and their elected [cheirotonesate] leaders, called 'episkopoi' or bishops, realized that maybe the world wasn't ending 'right away'.  They did gather in local little groups to discuss issues, but it wasn't until after the Treaty of Milan in 311, that they began to see themselves a large gathering called an 'ekklesia'.

<I've also known traditionalists whose company was a pleasure.>
So have I. It may be a cliche, but some of my best friends ...
But the folks we've been hearing from here are not Catholic traditionalists. They use some Catholic words and concepts, but they do not know, understand or believe the tradition. When they try to sing a Catholic tune, they are off-key.   
<That said, the ""fringe"" exhibit certain traits: ostentatious religiosity, anger, fear, paranoia, homophobia, political fancifulness, and, in the worst cases, misanthropy and detachment from reality.>
These are the characteristics of religious fundamentalism across various religions and denominations.  Fundamentalism is, in many respects, not so much a theological deviancy (although it is that) but a psychological deviancy.

The adjective 'consubstantial', for its part, could also lead a praying individual to a heterodox conclusion about the relationship between the Father and Jesus.

The idea expressed in the term 'consubstantial', as I understand it, is that Jesus' substantial form is *exactly* the same as the Father's, meaning that every potential of Jesus' is a potential of the Father's. That is the function of a substantial form. But if Jesus is able to suffer (a passive potential, but a potential nonetheless) then the Father, with the *same* (con-) *substantial form* (-substantial) must be able to suffer because it is a potential of that substantial form.

and contributing to the life of their local church.

Increasingly in the minds of many Adventists, school and its activities are essential and the church is optional - if nothing else is going on.

One can argue the merits of that and miss the pragmatic point.  Actually three points.

1. Increasingly, we are training a whole generation of children and their parents that church and active, involved, contribution, as stated above are optional and not essential.  Again, whichever side of the issue you might take - it is important to make the decision intentionally instead of drifting into it.  Maybe church should no longer be the important element in the lives of Adventist christians - but if we allow the trend to continue we will suffer a catastrophic result.

There is a phenomenon that I have observed and experienced in many successful endeavors - we tend to become a ""victim of our own success"".

It is precisely BECAUSE the SDA church has been successful, that we need to intentionally and constructively address these issues, which otherwise become BARRIERS to future success.

Jehovah's organization continues to grow and to prosper in its primary activity, spreading the Kingdom message.  This fact differs from your suggestion that the internet is presenting arguments that God's favor does not reside with Witnesses.
 
Your dogmatic comments do not align with scripture.  For example, your comment ""GOD would not get things wrong like too many end of world predictions to count.""  God was not the interpreter, men were.  Historically there are many historic accounts of God's chosen people making the wrong decisions or reaching incorrect conclusions.  Neither you nor this organization defines when the right time is for men to understand everything correctly. That's what is meant by the ""light will grow brighter"".

 I believe my comment above with the attached link to my post, attempts to enlighten our understanding of the “The Fall” and complement biblical teaching, that has been given to mankind by our Creator through His Spirit.

The kingdom of God is within us, if one is to search for further understanding one has to attempt to lift oneself out of the mire/mud that is covered by mist, the knowledge that is needed to do this is self-knowledge, and this can only come about by serving the Truth in humility (to know yourself as you truly are) as His inviolate Word (Will) is not open for debate, we His creatures can only bow down before His Will (Word)

The nuclear ""subsidies"" are based on the social cost of carbon. If you agree in the validity of a social cost of carbon and that the referenced basis of the price is a good source, you should agree what is being subsidized are the coal and gas-fired power plants not being charged the cost.
On the renewables team, there is a repeated mantra about renewables lowering wholesale market prices - but this rarely reduces prices for end-consumers. It creates other markets (such as those for capacity), and increases spending to transmission.

It is crucially important to understand that prior to the schism of 1054, Christians were aware of and fully accepted each others divergent sacramental practices. The loss of one of what JP2 called the ""two lungs"" of Christianity in that schism has contributed to a narrowing of perspective in both the East and West.

Each parish could be subdivided into small groups who would meet in one another's homes to share bread and wine.

The decline in numbers of priests for that last 40 years seems to be a sign that it's time for change, if the church is to continue. Few Catholic parishes are real communities.

The original completed Nicene Creed [381 A.D], declared that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father---period.  Western bishops at the Third Council of Toledo in 589 AD added ""and the son"" to the original version of the creed.  Therefore, the Catholic Profession of Faith states today, ""proceeds from the Father and the Son.""  But scripture is clear that Jesus says unequivocally, ""I will send him [the Holy Spirit] to you.""  The Greek Christians agreed with this, but they argued that 'sending' and 'proceeding' are not the same thing.  To them, the word ""proceed"" was equivalent to the word 'begot,' as in the verse in the creed which refers to the Son as begotten of the Father.

These thoughts from a spiritual master are a profound challenge for anyone progressive today.

Francis transformed these Rules into a progressive manifesto by saying, no one should have a problem with the gist of these rules provided you understand the Church in V2 terms--God's holy people, not the magisteriuim.  With that simple observation, the focus for finding the Spirit becomes What is happening among the entire Church, including all of the faithful, that matters. It does seem pretty obvious that Francis' Church and the magisterium are not at all pointed in the same direction. 

That is the deeper Francis, IMHO; but given his position and the need to hold this fractious people together, he has to push for open discussion rather than led in the direction he may prefer.

Second, a pastoral focus gives breathing room for people to center themselves on the Spirit of Christ in their hearts.  This centering moves toward the reign of God that Jesus preached.

Muller and the four cardinals don't appreciate how much distance there is from the Church when a person struggling to discern their conscience cannot be confident that a pastor will encourage that discernment.  Francis is encouraging that discernment.

But it's not a glum sort of mortification or sacrifice.  It's a very happy and rich and abandoning one.   ""what event will God unfold for us next to solve, with His graces ready for us.""

In fact, the virtues that can develop AS A RESULT of marriage and happily sacrificing parenting in the full Christian spirit - a parent happily on the Cross with Christ and for Christ - are endless.  Temperance, patience, fortitude, longanimity, optimism, generosity, detachment, etc.

""Parenting well"" is an endless program of virtue development, all ages.

An immigrant woman from the Shetlands is credited with the idea of adding designs to the garments the women were producing. And soon the women themselves were ""appropriating"" (and adapting) the designs they saw on sweaters worn by the local--British--fishermen. Apparently, the actual knitting technique is itself an adaptation (not mere ""adoption"") of the Shetland techniques; that's what makes the sweaters unique. When in the 1940s a Manitoba company began to mass-produce Cowichan sweater ""knock-offs,"" ironically a number of the indigenous knitters quickly incorporated their own versions of the ""commercialized"" designs into their work.

That refers to LEGISLATIVE powers, meaning only the House and Senate can legislate. The other two branches can't. The government as a whole derives its power from the people.

""How could both the national government and the states exercise sovereignty?  For Madison the answer was quite simple: all the power ultimately derived from a third entity: the people. Neither the national or state governments were truly self-governing. Both derived their authority from the consent of the governed.  The opening phrase of the preamble of the Constitution--""We the people of the United States""--reflected the conviction that the new government derived its power from the citizens.""

Bibles then were expensive hand-copied books, people might look at one 'chained down' in the Church, –  if they could read - but most probably just took the preacher's word for what it said.

Luther found that when he read the bible,  often the Bible did not support the practices he objected to. So he appealed to 'Sola Scriptura' - 'The Bible tells me so'–  as the norm, rather than 'the Church tells me so'. And he decided which Books.

With Guttenberg and the printing press coinciding with the Reformation, Bibles and Books became cheap & available.. Wanting to get good translations into modern languages, Protestant publishers took the 1st C. AD Jewish list of official books - rather than the Christian Septuagint list.

Vatican II largely reaffirmed the sacramental theology of Trent while simultaneously pointing to a broader, less Aristotelian understanding of sacraments.

Incidentally, in my view, it is not just historical depth in time but also historical breadth in geography (the Byzantine, Syrian, Egyptian Traditions) of the first millennium that warrant change. Since the Great Church (as come call it) of the first millennium was largely united, all the theologies of  all those culturally diverse Churches are fully valid today as markers in the past of what could be in the future. You may recall for example, that before the two recent synods, the wide range of possible solutions for remarried Catholics included the practice of the Byzantine Church.

Yes, maturity is an issue and God designs that when we are in a proper relationship with him we will be growing in experience and spiritual maturity.

However, Jehovah's witnesses are message bearers (Witnesses).  We are bearing the message that Jehovah is the true God, His purpose has always been the same.  That purpose does not include unrighteousness.  Therefore, the days of unrighteousness are numbered.  His Kingdom is the means by which He will restore this Earth to His original purpose.

So Francis asked Kasper to outline various sound theological ways this could be done.

I was trying to make a different point. This is not the first time in the Church's history that the language of the culture has changed. The first time round (from Greek to Latin) the Church embraced the change, and as a result its theology was enriched. The Church missed out on another paradigm language change moment at the time of the Reformation. Vatican II had the courage to accept the challenge of the vernacular. 

My basic point is about using the change in language as an opportunity to advance theological thinking, instead of being restricted to answers from the past.

Not necessarily.  Present truth in the time of Noah was that a flood was coming--get ready.  During Exodus it was follow the pillar of cloud/fire.  In the time of Jesus it was that the Messiah had come; accept Him.  These truths are still truth, and help us understand Scripture, but present truth today is the 3 angels' messages; prepare for the coming of Jesus.  None of these negate the old truths, however.

Yes we are still coming out of the mud (physical cosmos) into which we fell at The Fall metaphorically speaking.
Our Father has life in Himself and He is Timeless  (Changeless).
Jesus tells us he came (was sent) “To save that which was lost” this statement implies a former state, my understanding of lost is that we are lost in time and place; we all carry a divine timeless spark within us, we are more than a physical being Our Fathers living Word (Will) is singular.

Reconciliation is an act of union; it very often requires ""detachment"" from something we want to hold on to: a grudge, an opinion or resentment.

24085,"Reactance theory:  a motivational reaction to offers, persons, rules, or regulations that threaten or eliminate specific behavioral freedoms. Reactance occurs when a person feels that someone or something is taking away his or her choices or limiting the range of alternatives. 

Reactances can occur when someone is heavily pressured to accept a certain view or attitude. Reactance can cause the person to adopt or strengthen a view or attitude that is contrary to what was intended, and also increases resistance to persuasion.

This entire effort assumes that the Roman Canon is good liturgy, just a bit out of date.

What is missing is any relationship with the congregation.  Instead of focusing on the full, conscious, and active participation of all present as was repeatedly sought by the bishops of the Second Vatican Council, this is another clergy focused, theological exercise.  

What does it take to get the clergy and academics to realize that the PURPOSE of liturgy is to strengthen the people of God for living the way of Jesus in a hostile world and NOT to express theology, wonder, awe, or even beauty?  We have inserted so much teaching into the Eucharist that we have lost the experience it was meant to provide.

The family Rosary is another form of collective prayer.

They showed in the excellent researched The Spirit Level, that an increase in GDP/person in developed countries did not affect living conditions.  For example Japan is a bucket case economically but tied for top place as the best place to live. Further the US, tops in wealth and bottom as a place to live. 

The significant factor was income inequality(top 20% income divided by bottom 20%). The lower the inequality, the better the living conditions. That correlation held over 23 countries. No explanation why. But the data is solid.

What should happen is for conscience to well-up from the people who are practiced in faith/hope/ love: faith that is grounded in understanding the authentic connectedness of all life; hope that is justified in authentically informed consciousness of life's universal relatedness; and love that is solidly grounded in the sense of mutual and personal obligation to one another and all other;
except for these, people-based faith, hope and love, chaos prevails. It's for institutions, churches included, to recognize and authenticate people in faith/hope/love, communication/consciousness/conscience - the trinitarian dynamic of godlikeness.

This included bishops (episkopoi, “overseers”), priests (presbuteroi, “elders”) & deacons (diakonoi, “servants) By the mid 2nd century, the basic NT Canon had been established, as noted in the Muratorian Canon (~160 AD).

So within about 70 years after the Resurrection, there was an organization communicating across the Mediterranean. Not the type of an organization waiting for the end of the world.

For example, Lutherans would never agree that the Mass is a Sacrifice offered for the living and the dead. Catholics would never agree that the Mass is a mere commemoration of Christ's Sacrifice on the Cross. The word 'anamnesis' is used to paper over the different understandings of the English word 'memorial'.

Relative ratio's and ods ratios were given instead of absolute benefit; absolute risk was not reported nor was there any comment on the quality of the studies, disclosure of interest or sources of funding all of which is unusual for Cochrane.

It is well established that statins have risks attached. Before the patent expired the makers of Lipitor used to advertise widely.  While they emphasized relative ratio as a measure of benefit they (and I found this surprising) made it easy to calculate the absolute benefit and the absolute risk in very fine print on the last page of the advertisement.  If I recall correctly the absolute benefit was below 2% and the number of people who could not tolerate the drug around 3%.

Remember that when this dialogue was originally used, the people had elected the person they wanted to preside at their eucharist. That is, they had recognised in that person a natural but Spirit-given gift to lead them in shared prayer. Ordination was a prayer that this person be strengthened by the Spirit to put this [Spirit-given] gift at the service of the community.

So I believe ""... with your spirit"" was not just a recognition of ordination, but the people affirming why they chose this person to be ordained to be the presider at their Eucharist.

So I say, yes by all means ask the people to respond ""And with your Spirit"" ... but FIRST restore the ancient tradition of the people choosing their candidate for ordination.

Perhaps a limit of 80 or 120 was sufficient when the Church was mostly ""Old World"" and places that were settled (conquered?) by those from the Old World.  In many of these places - Europe, South/Central America, North America, Australia, the dominant culture, and certainly the culture with power, is an offshoot of the Old World cultures.  My point is that there was a great deal of cultural coherence - Old World - in how the Church grew, developed, even in its doctrine (?), and certainly in whom power was concentrated.  

Now the cultural dominance of the Old World and imposition of a foreign culture on a conquered nation is no longer happening.  Africa and Asia, where the faith is growing, are not culturally indoctrinated - they maintain a hold on their ages old cultures.

That is, no longer a state church, it is able to imagine a substantially new religious identity. Contrast that with the Church of England, still a state established church (with 24 unelected bishops sitting in Parliament) but unable to retain the allegiance of 80% of the population (less than 20% of the population identifies as Anglican in a recent poll).

Take the Eucharist. For 1500+ years it was explained in terms of pre-Christian religious ritual, like sacrifice and altars. The final stage in a sacrifice is the sharing of the victim to enable a distribution of the numinous among the believers.
The same ritual can be reinterpreted from a different perspective. Instead of the sacrifice as explanatory key, the meal can be understood as Christ's purpose. Christ died so that we can share in his life. The concluding communal meal is a more effective key today than the rarely experienced ritual sacrifice, in a Church based on communion.

The grandparent/ grandchild relationship is mellower than parent/ child relationships - which makes grandparents effective arbiters of witnessing the past with (perhaps) a clearer moral focus on the future.

But of course, if one craves the private devotion at mass fostered in the 1950s, then one may well not care much for the communal liturgy (which incidentally is what the Greek word means) where externals matter.
