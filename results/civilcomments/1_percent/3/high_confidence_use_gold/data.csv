3370,"What I found out when I started to attend a protestant bible study in college was that I knew a lot more of the ""integrative message"" of Scripture than most of my bible memorizing protestant friends.

I may not have been able to impress myself or others with verse/verbatim.

But I was less prone to confusion when one protestant friend tried to one up another protestant friend with a proof text.

Instead I fell back on my faith and on my constant exposure to Scripture through the Holy Mass, and was able to offer a more integrative scriptural answer to one of the points of the Bible study, even though I couldn't quote chapter/verse.

Instead I would say, as an example...""doesn't it also say somewhere in the NT that we should love God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength""?

It was only later on that I took up regular personal Scripture reading, and that too has been a huge help.  5 minutes a day.

Once again the emphasis is on business to the detriment of workers and taxpayers. An increase in the work force means more unemployment and thus more welfare costs, lower salaries  through competition for jobs.

What is even more unfortunate is the work of Wilkinson and Pickett is ignored. They showed in the excellent researched The Spirit Level, that an increase in GDP/person in developed countries did not affect living conditions.  For example Japan is a bucket case economically but tied for top place as the best place to live. Further the US, tops in wealth and bottom as a place to live. 

The significant factor was income inequality(top 20% income divided by bottom 20%). The lower the inequality, the better the living conditions. That correlation held over 23 countries. No explanation why. But the data is solid.

-What have I done today to draw out unity among believers?
-What ways have I instead added to division, doubt, disunity?

This was echoed in 1931 by Pius XI in his Quadragesimo Anno, ""In the first place, the worker must be paid a wage sufficient to support him and his family"".

More recently, in 1991, John Paul II issued Centesimus Annus, which says, ""If through necessity or fear of a worse evil the workman accepts harder conditions because an employer or contractor will afford no better, he is made the victim of force and injustice"". He says that the rights of the worker ""include a sufficient wage for the support of the family, social insurance for old age and unemployment, and adequate protection for the conditions of employment.""

The rituals for ordination exist and many references to ordained women also remain.  The question of whether the ordination of women was ""real ordination"" is a theological, not an historical question.  The ordinations of women were considered as having the same value as the ordination of men at the time.  Whether any or some of these ordinations met criteria developed much later can be decided, then, only by the theologians who now apply the criteria of their own time.

One result of this could be that everyone who discerns the action of God in their lives will realize their remarriage was sinful.

I'm not one to understand prophesies, but if memory serves, sometimes they come out in ways that we don't expect.  I would suggest that an institutional church could continue on after Francis, with a pope, and yet for all practical purposes, the church will have come down so far as to cross over into the general noise of society: essentially no more relevant than any other religion, secular organization, etc.   Under such a scenario, there would not need to be complete destruction/disappearance of the institution or it's popes: simply the realization that it no longer matters, that it affects few people, and has little influence on society.

Given the numbers who have left, or who stayed but effectively ""checked out,"" and the impact this will have on long term church demographics,  and the effective loss of trust in the institution triggered by the bishops, it may well be that Malachy could be correct, even if there are future popes.

In one sense people without pensions are lucky. A pension is part of the pay package. Those with no pension have control of all their total income - and they get more salary. With a pension your former employer is, in most cases, in your back pocket for life - your life.  There are a number of employers, including the federal government, which have taken from their pensioners. 

It is a little unnerving for example , as a military retiree to know that government, politicians, have control of our pensions. In the 80s the actuarial cost was 25.02% of salary. That is money we did not see.

There are 577 seats up for grabs, including 11 which represent more than 1.5 million French citizens living overseas. Each constituency represents about 125,000 inhabitants.

A total of 7,882 candidates are standing nationwide in a process expected to see many fresh faces elected - not least because more than 200 outgoing members of parliament are not running for re-election.

just to offset the always increasing burden on lower/mid-income homeowners, and the increasing percentage of retired homeowners whose real income always fall behind with the increasing costs associated with aging; & with our growing inflation. 
A minimally regressive sales tax on goods (With exemptions for grocery foods, prescriptions & medal, utilities etc) AND  on services (legal, accounting, haircuts, fast foods,etc)  need not be a revenue increase – but  be a substitute for a % of owner-occupied property taxes, & can be capped at a mid-range property assessment level.
As a substitute for some property taxes, it it would raise alternate revenues from tourists and Statewide Anchorage shoppers and relieve tax-stressed
low-to-mid income home-owners.

2998,"Kag, I'm shocked, shocked that someone who so keen on ""equality"" as yourself would forget that women can be abusive too.  

I'm sure that many counsellors encouraged beleagured spouses to stay with their abusive husbands or wives and make the marriage work.  But de facto separation was recognised asa necessity in some circumstances.  The Council of Trent decreed:  ""If anyone say that the Church errs when she, for many causes, decrees a separation of husband and wife in respect to bed and dwelling-place for a definite or an indefinite period; let him be anathema.""  So....anathema!  Anathema!

I notice a tendency among the rigid pro-Francis folk to assume that somehow family life today is better than it was in the 1950s, 1850s, or 1750s, despite all evidence to the contrary.  They seem to pick through the minutiae of data to stitch together a narrative that suits their purpose, held together by the feminist fiction that there's been a grand historical conspiracy to oppress women.",0,-2.3689709633794793,2.3689709633794793

McCain is a war hero and he's been a distinguished  senator for a very long time. I disagreed with his war like talk against Russia.
