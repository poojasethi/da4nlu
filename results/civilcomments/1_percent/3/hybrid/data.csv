I may not have been able to impress myself or others with verse/verbatim.

But I was less prone to confusion when one protestant friend tried to one up another protestant friend with a proof text.

Instead I fell back on my faith and on my constant exposure to Scripture through the Holy Mass, and was able to offer a more integrative scriptural answer to one of the points of the Bible study, even though I couldn't quote chapter/verse.

Instead I would say, as an example...""doesn't it also say somewhere in the NT that we should love God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength""?

-What have I done today to draw out unity among believers?
-What ways have I instead added to division, doubt, disunity?

Once again the emphasis is on business to the detriment of workers and taxpayers. An increase in the work force means more unemployment and thus more welfare costs, lower salaries  through competition for jobs.

What is even more unfortunate is the work of Wilkinson and Pickett is ignored.

For example Japan is a bucket case economically but tied for top place as the best place to live. Further the US, tops in wealth and bottom as a place to live.

I've just finished viewing on Amazon, Many Beautiful things. It is the 'hero's journey taken by a woman, and the woman is Lilias Trotter. She was a contemporary of John Ruskin and more than that I will not say for she is a woman who doesn't 'summarize' easily.  At the very end, there is a bit of her own words as she describes the giving of a dandelion... It is what a woman gives, what she brings! 

The film itself comes from Kurosawa Productions and is of a quality I have never seen before -- it is such a celebration of beauty!
