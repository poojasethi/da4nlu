Tough to say whether we should cheer this as a good move or decry it is scapegoating.

Maryam Monsef made a complete fool of herself in the democratic institutions portfolio.  Anyone who had the gaul to argue that they opposed referendums on important constitutional changes didn't deserve to claim any notion of supporting democracy.

That being said, I'm not sure that Ms. Monsef was really to blame here, the talking points seemingly came from the top (and by ""the top"" in this case I believe we're talking about Gerry Butts... her comments certainly seemed to match his style).

3132,"Gerald, some reflection is in order. You as a socialist feel the need to declare publicly that a dictatorial leader such as Castro betrayed socialism. Have you never noticed that capitalists feel no need to denounce dictators like Franco or Pinochet as betrayers of capitalism. Why is that?",0,0.0011054501728264832,0.0011054501728264832
4255,The Republican led investigation discovered that Hillary had a secret unsecured server. It illegally stored top secret information that was certainly hacked by our friends and enemies alike.  It discovered that she lied to the American people about the root cause of the attack. It wasn't a propaganda film as the administration lied about to the world.

The thugs stole his truck to smash the electrified gate and bust the door to the building. It all happened in 6 minutes.  He has gone beyond what the BATF&E demand for securing those weapons.
How about holding the thugs and punks responsible for breaking in and stealing weapons, or anything else?  Stiffer jail time, and completely eliminate the parole systems in all 50 states (the federal government does not have a parole system).  The death penalty (within 5 years of conviction) for anyone using a stolen gun in a crime.
