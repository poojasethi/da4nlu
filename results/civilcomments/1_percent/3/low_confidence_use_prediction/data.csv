I have a pastor friend who does missions in Peru and he said many of the Christian churches have a mix of protestant, catholic, and native gods.   A spiritual life doesn't demand or expect empirical evidence and a myth can being meaningful, if not factual.

And there's a strong parallel here in that Mitchener in his novel 'Caribbean' wrote about the history of the Caribs and Arawaks, aboriginal peoples of the Caribbean. (Quelle horreur!) It's a bizarre prejudice indeed to hold that to be credible or ""authentic"" one can, and indeed must(!), only write about one's own group, nationality or race. Operating under such a restriction, much of the world's literature would be rendered illegitimate. Why Boyden might have embellished his personal backstory is a bit of a mystery to me. But I can't help but wonder if he might have done this because he believed that unless he was thought to be aboriginal his work wouldn't be taken seriously by this country's identity-focused cultural and media doyens?

My experience with those who emphasize Jesus the man will then claim that He was limited by the place and time in which He lived, that he may have been uneducated, illiterate, that He just didn't understand things the way we do now-----so how can we be sure what He would have thought about our ""modern day"" issues? They do not want to allow that He was Fully Divine as well and, though He didn't go around flaunting it, would have known Everything, and I mean Everything-all languages, the hearts and minds of people, the past-present and future of humanity and what would come, ALL science since God/Jesus is behind the science, etc.",0,-0.22614844290390845,0.22614844290390845

Sorry, but Church history shows that you are incorrect here.  People didn't just believe that folks came to believe that Jesus was divine as quickly as you may have assumed.  

The First Ecumenical Council of Nicaea [325] tackled issues that were more difficult than you are highlighting.  The question that the great theologian Arias was posing was that ONLY the Father was un-begotten, and that Jesus was created.  Arius DID BELIEVE that Jesus as SON possessed a dignity superior to everyone else.  Arius was very persuasive among the Greek bishops.  Since the unity of Christianity was at stake here, the Emperor Constantine was hoping for someone to come forward with a solution to the problem.  A solution came from a bright young deacon attending the council, whose name was Athanasius.  Athanasius believed that an article of faith was needed and then he presented three concepts that the Council Fathers could accept 1) The Son was 'homoiousious' 'of like substance with the Father.",1,0.18759325382069458,0.18759325382069458

  The entire local church should participate in the selection of their bishop.  One method of selecting a bishop that the Church should consider is to create a special diocesan synod made up of representatives of all the parish communities, religious orders, and priests' councils.  The synod members would be responsible for helping to create the terna after receiving the names of potential candidates from their respective parishes, religious communities and priests' councils.

RTD is not generating as much in sales tax revenues (as projected) because more people are shopping online.  4. With 75%-80% of every trip subsidized by taxpayers, adding significantly more service will not generate enough new revenue to cover the cost with just the added farebox revenue, only a(nother) tax increase will cover the total cost of significantly more service.  5. The federal government is not an unending source of ""free"" money to fund local transit projects.  6.

When our system was an insurance system for illness, the cost was predictable and controllable. It covered only the people who got sick. 
When the system was changed to a preventive system, we now covered the other healthy 99%. On any one day, any number of people could decide to have their cholesterol or blood pressure checked, their DNA checked for genetic diseases, or a physical for their own purposes or for their child's participation in soccer or hockey. Suddenly the cost became completely unpredictable.

Actually went to the game last night, I had to watch this battle in person, had a really good seat and I will leave at that. Couple of things, as I suspected Paxton really can't read a defense, that was very evident from my vantage point. Paxton would look at 1 or 2 Wrs, if they weren't open he would just run, whether or not the pocket broke down, that is a major red flag to me. And the few times he stay in the pocket for the most part couldn't located an open Wr in early part of the game.

The part most of you guys didn't see was when the Broncos went to commercial, the coaches were huddle around Paxton basically tell him the coverage. The coaches were basically telling Lynch the Bears are were running a few basic coverages. For the most part, the Bears were in cover two most of the night, Trevor Siemian know it and was slicing and dicing the Bears for 6/7 for 51 yards.

Not for drugs, or health care or food or rent or whatever, but the complete package. Now there are various programs meeting those needs.  Much administration. 

I suspect that most people are better looking after themselves than having someone looking after them. Thus rather than being serviced by various programs, better to give people money so they can look after themselves.
