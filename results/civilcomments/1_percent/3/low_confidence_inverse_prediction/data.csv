Canadians or provincial citizens can be divided into two groups. First those who are able to look after their needs, and second those that need help. Not for drugs, or health care or food or rent or whatever, but the complete package. Now there are various programs meeting those needs.  Much administration. 

I suspect that most people are better looking after themselves than having someone looking after them. Thus rather than being serviced by various programs, better to give people money so they can look after themselves.
That way only people who need help get help. Under pharmacare or government healthcare, 100% of Canadians get help - which most do not need.

I discussed this with one of my interviewees, who pointed out there's a significant difference in the land ownership situation in Chinatown versus Kaka'ako.

And studies show that ""just-in-time"" financial lessons are the most effective at developing lasting Financial Literacy. So as suggested, try to take every opportunity to casually explain to your kids why you are buying what you are buying. And when they ask for something, you may want to have them visit a free and safe site called giftingsense.com. It is dedicated to helping parents teach their children how to think before they buy in a simple and quick but meaningful way. They can learn about DIMS (Does It Make Sense) Scores for example, which are easily calculated and help a child understand if a request is more of a want (1-6) or a need (7-10).

One result of this could be that everyone who discerns the action of God in their lives will realize their remarriage was sinful.

One of the hidden and non-discussed issues is the choice of medicine as a life-style choice.   In the past (even older than your practice) - medicine was a calling.   It still is for many (hopefully the majority) but the reality is, a growing portion of our medical graduates chose medicine for the wrong reasons.    EG:  In a major urban center - try to find a young, female GP.    I was shocked at the number who required membership fees at a clinic where 6 partners worked the equivalent of 3 full time doctors.    These are the type of doctors complaining the loudest.      One of the hidden problems is the number of NEW graduates who end up working a part-time career as a choice because our system allows and rewards that.     That is a very poor use of a resource (and medical graduates are a resource.",0,0.16018712789403244,0.16018712789403244

I'm not one to understand prophesies, but if memory serves, sometimes they come out in ways that we don't expect.

Given the numbers who have left, or who stayed but effectively ""checked out,"" and the impact this will have on long term church demographics,  and the effective loss of trust in the institution triggered by the bishops, it may well be that Malachy could be correct, even if there are future popes.

Many argue we need a growing U.S. population to support Social Security. It strikes me how absurd it is that some people simultaneously claim to be champions of Social Security *and* champions of the environment, when the very Social Security system they champion is designed to destroy the environment through overpopulation.

For the past 10 years (the ""Great Recession"") U.S. population growth has slowed to rates similar to those of the Great Depression in the 1930s. If you smooth out the ups and downs of the boom and bust economic cycles and take the average annual population growth of the 20th century, and apply this average growth rate to each year going forward, in 240 years the population of the U.S. will equal the 2017 population of Earth. 240 years isn't that far away.

Indeed,  European Union transportation policy requires that member nations open up their high speed intercity passenger rail service routes for competitive bidding from private companies.  These private operators are interested in bidding only because of previous extensive governmental capital investments in rail tracks, signals, stations and related infrastructure.

After decades of large-scale rail infrastructure capital investment in all-new HSR lines, France has decided to turn its financial attention to modernizing its conventional-speed intercity rps routes. These ordinary, slower-speed routes do continue to require operating assistance funding, but the French HSR network earns enough revenue to cover 100% of its operating costs and, in some cases, nearly all of its capital investment needs.",1,-0.013188709661742015,0.013188709661742015
