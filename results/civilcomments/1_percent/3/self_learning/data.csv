3370,"What I found out when I started to attend a protestant bible study in college was that I knew a lot more of the ""integrative message"" of Scripture than most of my bible memorizing protestant friends.

I may not have been able to impress myself or others with verse/verbatim.

But I was less prone to confusion when one protestant friend tried to one up another protestant friend with a proof text.

Instead I fell back on my faith and on my constant exposure to Scripture through the Holy Mass, and was able to offer a more integrative scriptural answer to one of the points of the Bible study, even though I couldn't quote chapter/verse.

Instead I would say, as an example...""doesn't it also say somewhere in the NT that we should love God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength""?

It was only later on that I took up regular personal Scripture reading, and that too has been a huge help.  5 minutes a day.

Once again the emphasis is on business to the detriment of workers and taxpayers. An increase in the work force means more unemployment and thus more welfare costs, lower salaries  through competition for jobs.

What is even more unfortunate is the work of Wilkinson and Pickett is ignored.

For example Japan is a bucket case economically but tied for top place as the best place to live. Further the US, tops in wealth and bottom as a place to live. 

The significant factor was income inequality(top 20% income divided by bottom 20%). The lower the inequality, the better the living conditions. That correlation held over 23 countries. No explanation why. But the data is solid.

That refers to LEGISLATIVE powers, meaning only the House and Senate can legislate. The other two branches can't. The government as a whole derives its power from the people.

""How could both the national government and the states exercise sovereignty?  For Madison the answer was quite simple: all the power ultimately derived from a third entity: the people. Neither the national or state governments were truly self-governing. Both derived their authority from the consent of the governed.  The opening phrase of the preamble of the Constitution--""We the people of the United States""--reflected the conviction that the new government derived its power from the citizens.""

Ultimately the issue is the West's lack of insight into Byzantine practice (the Orthodox, on the basis of their understanding of their own liturgical books, have restored the female diaconate, and Orthodoxy in general is far more conservative that the West). 

It is crucially important to understand that prior to the schism of 1054, Christians were aware of and fully accepted each others divergent sacramental practices. The loss of one of what JP2 called the ""two lungs"" of Christianity in that schism has contributed to a narrowing of perspective in both the East and West.

I've just finished viewing on Amazon, Many Beautiful things. It is the 'hero's journey taken by a woman, and the woman is Lilias Trotter. She was a contemporary of John Ruskin and more than that I will not say for she is a woman who doesn't 'summarize' easily.  At the very end, there is a bit of her own words as she describes the giving of a dandelion... It is what a woman gives, what she brings! 

The film itself comes from Kurosawa Productions and is of a quality I have never seen before -- it is such a celebration of beauty! 

And Lilias Trotter well could have been kin to Charles Foucauld for her love of people, the desert, and in them her love of God bore such fruit.

Here's what her pathetic non-apology avoids addressing: it's quite possible to SLANDER someone without naming him if one provides sufficient identifying details--example, if I were to falsely accuse the only Native Alaskan orthodontist in Bethesda, MD of a crime, I could be held liable for slander without actually having named that person outright. And so can she.  And so she did.

And trying to blame her 'untrustworthy source' is NO excuse--referencing an anti-Muslim hate site to slander a Muslim community-member is no more justifiable than referencing an anti-Semitic hate site to slander a Jewish community-member.

One result of this could be that everyone who discerns the action of God in their lives will realize their remarriage was sinful. More likely, some will discover that, while others will be opened to see God's involvement in their family.

I'm not one to understand prophesies, but if memory serves, sometimes they come out in ways that we don't expect.  I would suggest that an institutional church could continue on after Francis, with a pope, and yet for all practical purposes, the church will have come down so far as to cross over into the general noise of society: essentially no more relevant than any other religion, secular organization, etc.   Under such a scenario, there would not need to be complete destruction/disappearance of the institution or it's popes: simply the realization that it no longer matters, that it affects few people, and has little influence on society.

Given the numbers who have left, or who stayed but effectively ""checked out,"" and the impact this will have on long term church demographics,  and the effective loss of trust in the institution triggered by the bishops, it may well be that Malachy could be correct, even if there are future popes.

General population studies cannot be applied to a specifically filtered group - which is what Eg: Soh does.

In one sense people without pensions are lucky. A pension is part of the pay package. Those with no pension have control of all their total income - and they get more salary. With a pension your former employer is, in most cases, in your back pocket for life - your life.  There are a number of employers, including the federal government, which have taken from their pensioners. 

It is a little unnerving for example , as a military retiree to know that government, politicians, have control of our pensions. In the 80s the actuarial cost was 25.02% of salary. That is money we did not see.

Why would our liturgical presiders/ministers do any less today (e.g. foreign Latin language, vox secreta) in modern liturgical proclamation? 

The liturgical theology that I learned holds that the act of proclamation *for reception* by the congregation is an act of salvation. If not for the congregation's reception, then why even proclaim? Towards what end?

You asked why quibble about the use of the term 'consubstantial'. It is because the central Roman Catholic bureaucracy first quibbled about the phrase 'one in being'.

The 14th Amendment's 'equal protection' should be sufficient for you but I doubt you accept anything from the Constitution...certainly nothing you have cited so far.

1927,"In spite of what this Catholic group states, the Bible also says in several places, those who do not work should not eat, this command is below:

2Th 3:9-11  It was not because we do not have that right, but to give you in ourselves an example to imitate.  (10)  For even when we were with you, we would give you this command: If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat.  

Psa 37:25  I have been young, and now am old, yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken or his children begging for bread.

And the verse they use is a poor motivation for helping the poor - So we are supposed to give in order to get ? I do realize there is a balance as some cannot provide for themselves and therefore must be provided for. Most homeless people I see are clearly taking advantage of others generosity, and it must stop. Catholic groups also emphasize giving and works as a way of entering into Heaven, Christ is the only a person can gain access to Heaven.",0,-2.1648426145924393,2.1648426145924393
