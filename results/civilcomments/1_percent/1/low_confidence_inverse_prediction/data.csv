Trump has a renaiaisence  program for making American great again.
Lower corporate taxes to lure US manufacturers back to the US and a tariff on those who choose to manufacture elsewhere and import those good to the US.

Simple but brilliant.

By this lack of objection to chattel slavery, it is quite clear that the Church DID support it. Or are you going to pretend that the magisterium's attitude was ""this is immoral, but you can keep on doing it""? That would be hypocritical in the extreme.

No, your contention that the Church did not condone chattel slavery is clearly false.

Scripture, at least the Old Testament, does not see anything wrong with polygamy.  Abraham, Jacob, David and Solomon all had more than one wife and there is not a hint of condemnation for their doing so, nor do any of the laws of the OT forbid it. Thus, one can certainly say that Scripture supports polygamy.

3895,"It was pointed out by Trump that Hillary was not qualified to be President.  I agree with Trump but I also felt the same about Trump.  The term ""baggage"" was brought up, especially by Trump.   It seems that the baggage of Trump was just as bad if not worse, and the more that is unpacked, the less effective he will be as President, which he already is.  When the ""family"" needs to hire lawyers, the President and Vice-President hire lawyers, need I say more.  It is time for Trump to pack his bags and go home.",0,0.0007492898960514971,0.0007492898960514971
