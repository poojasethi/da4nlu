3391,"What I found out when I started to attend a protestant bible study in college was that I knew a lot more of the ""integrative message"" of Scripture than most of my bible memorizing protestant friends.

I may not have been able to impress myself or others with verse/verbatim.

But I was less prone to confusion when one protestant friend tried to one up another protestant friend with a proof text.

Instead I fell back on my faith and on my constant exposure to Scripture through the Holy Mass, and was able to offer a more integrative scriptural answer to one of the points of the Bible study, even though I couldn't quote chapter/verse.

Instead I would say, as an example...""doesn't it also say somewhere in the NT that we should love God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength""?

It was only later on that I took up regular personal Scripture reading, and that too has been a huge help.  5 minutes a day.

Once Don Young expires she can take his place as our state's most embarrassing buffoon.

Here's what her pathetic non-apology avoids addressing: it's quite possible to SLANDER someone without naming him if one provides sufficient identifying details--example, if I were to falsely accuse the only Native Alaskan orthodontist in Bethesda, MD of a crime, I could be held liable for slander without actually having named that person outright. And so can she.  And so she did.

And trying to blame her 'untrustworthy source' is NO excuse--referencing an anti-Muslim hate site to slander a Muslim community-member is no more justifiable than referencing an anti-Semitic hate site to slander a Jewish community-member. It's still slander--it's NOT 'free speech'. That's why we have laws AGAINST slander.

I think perhaps Pope Francis is trying to teach us that life is more nuanced, more complicated than that - that gray areas do in fact exist and that we should all learn to become more comfortable with them. Alas, some people are having none of it. To my mind, one of the best lines in Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" is when Gandalf says to Frodo Baggins, ""Even the very wise cannot see all ends.""

Indeed,  European Union transportation policy requires that member nations open up their high speed intercity passenger rail service routes for competitive bidding from private companies.  These private operators are interested in bidding only because of previous extensive governmental capital investments in rail tracks, signals, stations and related infrastructure.

After decades of large-scale rail infrastructure capital investment in all-new HSR lines, France has decided to turn its financial attention to modernizing its conventional-speed intercity rps routes.

The child notes a definite plan in the arrangement of the books, a mysterious order, which it does not comprehend, but only dimly suspects. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of the human mind, even the greatest and most cultured, toward God.

Here you go - from Francis himself about folks who call the work of unity and common good - tendentious:

“A Catholic Church reduced to mere baggage, to a collection of rules and prohibitions, to fragmented devotional practices, to selective and partial adherence to the truths of the faith, to occasional participation in some sacraments, to the repetition of doctrinal principles, to bland or nervous moralizing, that does not convert the life of the baptized would not withstand the trials of time. Our greatest danger is the gray pragmatism of the daily life of the Church in which everything apparently continues normally, but in reality the faith is being consumed and falling into meanness.” (Document of Aparecida #12)

Yep, RD, *falling into meanness* - please reflect on this

BTW - doctrines and their applications do change in our history....dogmas do not.  So, protest is part of the church process",0,-2.193323023752533,2.193323023752533
