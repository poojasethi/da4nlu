3391,"What I found out when I started to attend a protestant bible study in college was that I knew a lot more of the ""integrative message"" of Scripture than most of my bible memorizing protestant friends.

I may not have been able to impress myself or others with verse/verbatim.

But I was less prone to confusion when one protestant friend tried to one up another protestant friend with a proof text.

Instead I fell back on my faith and on my constant exposure to Scripture through the Holy Mass, and was able to offer a more integrative scriptural answer to one of the points of the Bible study, even though I couldn't quote chapter/verse.

Instead I would say, as an example...""doesn't it also say somewhere in the NT that we should love God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength""?

It was only later on that I took up regular personal Scripture reading, and that too has been a huge help.  5 minutes a day.

Once Don Young expires she can take his place as our state's most embarrassing buffoon.

Here's what her pathetic non-apology avoids addressing: it's quite possible to SLANDER someone without naming him if one provides sufficient identifying details--example, if I were to falsely accuse the only Native Alaskan orthodontist in Bethesda, MD of a crime, I could be held liable for slander without actually having named that person outright. And so can she.  And so she did.

And trying to blame her 'untrustworthy source' is NO excuse--referencing an anti-Muslim hate site to slander a Muslim community-member is no more justifiable than referencing an anti-Semitic hate site to slander a Jewish community-member. It's still slander--it's NOT 'free speech'. That's why we have laws AGAINST slander.

If Pope Francis were to be willing to state there is no actual important difference other than the genders must have some physical differences to procreate then his critique of transgenders would be more sensible. His sexism makes him accidently more supportive of transgender's claim to have real reason to change their bodies. 

That being said I have asked transgenders and when they explain why they feel they were born in the wrong gendered body, their answers always go back to false stereotypes.  Such as I am a man but I am a nurturer and emotional and creative or . . . .",0,-0.007486236221687648,0.007486236221687648
