But, he said, “The level of hate, personal attacks and homophobia is breathtaking.”
But he said the institutional church faces a bigger challenge.
“The larger question is how will the church deal with trolls? How will the church deal with well-organized and well-funded online sites and individuals which are motivated by hatred, and which seem to have as much influence as local ordinaries in getting a lecture cancelled? Basically, how will we deal with Catholics who hate?” he asked.

There is a serious problem of sex bias in tech. Confronted with the disappearance of women, many technologists respond with sometimes hateful claims that biology is responsible. But a constant factor (biology) cannot explain dynamic change (declining participation). These people are choosing evidence to suit their conclusion. Their blinkered obsession with science blinds them to the history of how women were pushed out (see Ensmenger's book The Computer Boys Take Over).

Against the New Homophiles he does not see same-sex attraction as a gift “in and of itself.” He insists that any goods “supposedly unique to homosexuality are common to man, and all that is good in man is the result of being made in the image and likeness of God.”

He opposes the New Homophile notion of “gay exceptionalism” flowing from the supposed good of homosexuality. “No,” he says, “the good is the redemptive healing work of God that begins when we honestly acknowledge that homosexuality is a wound” and he says that if same-sex attracted persons take this view they can become “wounded healers.”",0,-0.08431408005450747,0.08431408005450747

He has already punched through the bottom of the barrel and the swamp is pouring in, but in the depth of darkness his shadow produces as he squats in the base of the leaking vessel, beating and chipping with all his might,  he believes he has found a fount of loyalty.

3757,"The slaves brought to the US and the ""New World"" from Africa were captured by black Africans and sold to the Portugese, the British, the Germans, the Spaniards and whoever else would buy them just as those black Africans had been capturing and selling each other for centuries.  

It was just business as usual for those black Africans.  

Their grandfathers and great-grandfathers had been doing it long before we showed up.

The women were raped by those same black Africans before they were sold unless they thought they would bring a bigger price as virgins.

""Slavery was practiced in some parts of Africa,[16] Europe,[16] Asia[16] and the Americas for many centuries before the beginning of the Atlantic slave trade. There is evidence that enslaved people from some African states were exported to other states in Africa, Europe, and Asia prior to the European colonization of the Americas""

No, Obama did not cause division at all.  The hatred toward him shown by some  in Congress and in the public  was wrong and racially tinged.  As a Native American, I never felt that  dishonored me or my people. He certainly never condemned whites or other races.  Stop with the nonsense.",1,-0.005181351488782404,0.005181351488782404

There should always be room for theater of the absurd.  Imagine a peacock putting on display what it believes are its higher level critical thinking skills.  There is a wonderful combination of having nothing worth saying but saying it anyway with pompous eloquence.

4434,"I am a police officer who happens to be white.  There are prejudices in every race, religion and profession.  BLM is a terrible organization, plain and simple, the organizers that is, not the protesters.  They espouse violent radical acts against the police and society in general, which has resulted in executions of police officers and property destruction.  Church leaders and ministers need to concern themselves with the growing violence that is occurring daily in Cities such as Chicago, Memphis, New Orleans, and Philadelphia. This violence happens to involve black on black crime, but no one wants to acknowledge the elephant in the room and do something to change it.     BLM is a political sham funded by George Soros with the sole intention of creating chaos, anger and disorder into our society.  I am still trying to figure out his end game.
