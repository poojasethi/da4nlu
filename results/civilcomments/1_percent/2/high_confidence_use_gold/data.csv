These two theological spheres are 'practical' means of seeking understanding via faith (theology). They needn't be bogged down by the arcane terminologies of imperfect philosophies (e.g. Aristotelianism, Thomism) applied in more systematic means of doing theology.

Understanding and expression are very important in the sphere of Liturgy. If we don't allow Liturgy to develop liturgically, but instead use our imperfect philosophical-theological lexicon to supress expression rather than to guide it, then how can we model the parrhesia of the Church that we read about in the Acts of the Apostles?

These thoughts from a spiritual master are a profound challenge for anyone progressive today.

Francis transformed these Rules into a progressive manifesto by saying, no one should have a problem with the gist of these rules provided you understand the Church in V2 terms--God's holy people, not the magisteriuim.  With that simple observation, the focus for finding the Spirit becomes What is happening among the entire Church, including all of the faithful, that matters. It does seem pretty obvious that Francis' Church and the magisterium are not at all pointed in the same direction. 

That is the deeper Francis, IMHO; but given his position and the need to hold this fractious people together, he has to push for open discussion rather than led in the direction he may prefer.

It is my understanding that Francis wanted to have collegial synods, in which all bishops openly expressed their minds, work out their disagreements, and reach a consensus, rather than, as had been the case with P6, JP2, and B16 have the college affirm a pre-existing papal decision expressed in the preparatory document. 

So he picked a topic that ought, he thought, to have been easy...finding some way to legitimize faithful remarried-divorced Catholics receiving the Eucharist, as many were already doing. So Francis asked Kasper to outline various sound theological ways this could be done. There was nothing novel in what he wrote for professional theologians, but when he wrote was novel for many less theologically astute Catholics, including many bishops.

I understand that the latter adjectival phrase communicates, more intelligibly than the former adjective, that Jesus is united to the Father in a way that no creature is. Moreover, by means of Aristotelian metaphysical terminology, 'consubstantial' intends to communicate that Jesus' substantial form is that of the Father's, whereas ours is that of creation. 

The adjectival phrase 'one in being', I argue, communicates the distinction of Jesus from the rest of humankind, as the Nicaean and Constantinopolitan creeds intended. The adjective 'consubstantial' does the same, albeit in a vocabulary foreign to all individuals, praying in the English language, who are not familiar with Aristotelian metaphysical co-principles, such as matter and form.

We cannot allow our Church to become a church primarily for the middle-class and rich while throwing a bone to the poor. The priority should be given to the poor even if we have to let the middle-class and rich fend for themselves.
Practically speaking, the Catholic Schools must close and the resources used for “Confraternity of Christian Doctrine” and other programs which can be kept open to the poor. Remember, the Church managed without Catholic Schools for centuries. We can get along without them today.

He pinpoints a lack of satisfaction with worship as the reason 70% of Catholics who become Protestants give for doing so. Approximately half of US Catholics who leave the Church do so to become Protestants. That's millions. Of course, there are other reasons, everyone is different, but surely to say so does not constitute Revisionism. Naturally, Father Reese does not blame the banishment of the Latin Mass (though interestingly he does acknowledge that is the case for 11 % - a good argument against his advocacy of renewed banishment at least). Balance would have been to include the material from his earlier article in this one. As to bias, I have a different opinion based on a different interpretation.

Ordinary lay need to do this ""under the radar"", quietly, in their families first, spilling into their neighborhoods, then quietly among the children & teachers & activities of schools - including public schools, adding a more wholesome tone to activities done in the schools, not overly Christian, but with a warmth and tone fitting of a decent culture.

Indeed,  European Union transportation policy requires that member nations open up their high speed intercity passenger rail service routes for competitive bidding from private companies.

It appears to me, however, that those trapped in the hierarchicalism, legalism & rigorism repudiated by the Pope, likely lacked the theological imagination required to benevolently interpret it, precisely because the logical legacy of those -isms lead to fraught tautological terms, wherein one's conclusions are already embedded, and to invalid premises, fatally flawed by category errors, like conflations of moral & prudential judgments, or of divine & natural law with positive laws, church & public.

If one follows the principle of Eccl. 9:10, it won't matter whether or not one has a title; work will be done; the Gospel will advance; the Spirit will lead.  During the great Advent Awakening in the 1800's, sometimes children got up and preached when adults were forbidden to do so.  God's work will go forward, with or without WO.  So, rather than agitating for it, why not just do the work close by, and, if the Lord wants women to be ordained, He will engineer it in His own time and way.

Many great players are from there as noted, and most were stars on their teams. No question this defense with him stuffing the run can really set the pace of a game and will be depended on the rest of the year.

I really look for Denver to flex their muscles a bit tonight. The defense could possibly get a shutout. The offense with a bye week for them to get some great time to work on things, should get at least 30. Seems like just about everyone is healthy. I'd be very disappointed if I see them missing plays and allowing the Giants to compete closely. I mean the Chargers beat these guys in their house. I don't care if it's a road game with lousy refs or a ""trap game"", Denver has way too much talent for this to be a close game.
