And, Mary did what all women do, she took the sustenance of her body and transformed it so that it became the body and blood of Jesus.

I don't know why all priests aren't women given that God gave women the natural ability to perform transubstantiation.  Although, I like the point that Jesus being born male does ""balance things"" so neither gender really should claim some preference from God for priestly powers.
I am glad this came late in this comment stream.  No telling what a storm this comment would raise.  

I am surprised at the reaction to what I thought was a reasonable search into why maleness is associated with God and how that translates into a male priesthood.  Unsaid, I really wonder if we not only project human maleness on God but men also assume they are God, or more Godlike, because they are male.

No, that is practically the *definition* of libertarianism.

Libertarians hold that we should not use coercion and force to get the things we believe are good.

Rather, we should respect the self-ownership of all individuals and see them as worthy of equal respect on the most fundamental level.

Because libertarians believe that charity should be personal, rather than handled through government bureaucracies that take money through force, they implicitly support more love and care for their fellow man than do statists who would have government forcibly monopolize charity and separate it from individual action and involvement.",0,-0.06732500570220518,0.06732500570220518

Kris Kobach:
1) Found to have wrongly discarded 18,000 ballots (court case) as Secretary of State of Kansas.
2) Convicted a whopping 9 people over the course of multiple elections....most of whom were people that weren't from the party he assumed they would be (most have been registered Republicans) or the ethnicity (all convicted were white, non-Hispanic).

Ken Blackwell:
1) Oversaw not one, but two releases to the public of private information of millions of Ohio voters as Secretary of State.
2) Used Diebold machines in Ohio in 2004, after requests were made not to do so; also went with touch screen machines, which don't leave a paper trail.  Blackwell later (Jan. 2005) purchased stock in Diebold.

736,"I'm glad you just now looked up what CPI was, but let me clue you in on how that works: Inflation percentages fluctuate- so when the market goes down, so will her wages, genius: if the purchasing power of the dollar drives what she earns, then what- you want companies to increase their prices by a few dollars when people only receive pennies in increases each year and still be profitable?  Unemployment will go up, which then means businesses can pay LESS and be more selective of labor-- I don't think you've thought this one through.",1,0.003973746958540525,0.003973746958540525

But it would be nice to know the true numbers, and nice to pick primarily the skilled immigrants we will need to replace a retiring generation of boomers.

3921,"It shouldn't be the moderators responsibility to fact check the candidates.   It is often very frustrating that the debate format often blocks the opposing candidate from a full rebuttal.  Trumps is an outrageous liar, even for the political arena, but the public is looking to compare the canidates.  Those that doubt Clinton in the interntional area against the male forces the likes of Putin or the most of the male dominated conservative Arab world, want to see if she can stand up to our own home grown bully.   This question on the use of power is a huge concern for all, both domestically and in foreign policy.   

Said or unsaid, most of us have a stereotype of very different styles between men and women and the use of power.   Personally I'm expecting a fight.  I want a fight, they tend to be revealing when the conflict exposes real emotional honesty.  Clinton has more risk, but high risk offers a big reward as well.

What a glorious discussion it is. For the most part, it was the host dissing Cruz for his lack of leadership and substantive work to get anything done. For callers, it was the problem with Trump starting with his inability to get elected. Not that many disagreed with him, but that his approach will lose women and Latinos in the election.

A temple could be in a city. I suppose Her mountain-top worship places were not in a city, as cities had to be near water. I suppose Her sacred Groves were not inside cities. Adherents would have had homes in towns and cities

The St. Joseph Sisters’ catalog tells me the meaning of Mark 14:8 is “She has done what was in her power to do.”  The picture on the plaque in the online catalog shows a full moon. HER symbol. So neat. Also: ""She has done all that is in her power to do.” Is 'power' in your translation? (I have no financial interest.) Even while trying to diminish her power, the 1st-century biblical author likely acknowledged it.  “What she has done will be told in remembrance of her.” Why isn’t this remembered in church each and every Sunday if it is so memorable? The Vatican Catechism is very conflicted on how they remember the Bride and the Gospel never lets us know who it is (edited out of John?)
