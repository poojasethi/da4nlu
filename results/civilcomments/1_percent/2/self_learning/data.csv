Understanding and expression are very important in the sphere of Liturgy.

These thoughts from a spiritual master are a profound challenge for anyone progressive today.

Francis transformed these Rules into a progressive manifesto by saying, no one should have a problem with the gist of these rules provided you understand the Church in V2 terms--God's holy people, not the magisteriuim.  With that simple observation, the focus for finding the Spirit becomes What is happening among the entire Church, including all of the faithful, that matters. It does seem pretty obvious that Francis' Church and the magisterium are not at all pointed in the same direction. 

That is the deeper Francis, IMHO; but given his position and the need to hold this fractious people together, he has to push for open discussion rather than led in the direction he may prefer.

The adjectival phrase 'one in being', I argue, communicates the distinction of Jesus from the rest of humankind, as the Nicaean and Constantinopolitan creeds intended. The adjective 'consubstantial' does the same, albeit in a vocabulary foreign to all individuals, praying in the English language, who are not familiar with Aristotelian metaphysical co-principles, such as matter and form.

We enjoy the opportunity to get out of the car and go to a café or restaurant for a quick snack or meal while the car is charging. We have also met some interesting folks at the charging stations, and have never had to wait for a free charger.

The third way is for ordinary lay people to re-Christianize the whole world, like Jesus told us to do, and which the early Christians actually did, Christianizing not just a pagan empire, but a viciously persecuting pagan world, and they did it in just a few hundred years.

Ordinary lay need to do this ""under the radar"", quietly, in their families first, spilling into their neighborhoods, then quietly among the children & teachers & activities of schools - including public schools, adding a more wholesome tone to activities done in the schools, not overly Christian, but with a warmth and tone fitting of a decent culture.

Indeed,  European Union transportation policy requires that member nations open up their high speed intercity passenger rail service routes for competitive bidding from private companies.  These private operators are interested in bidding only because of previous extensive governmental capital investments in rail tracks, signals, stations and related infrastructure.

After decades of large-scale rail infrastructure capital investment in all-new HSR lines, France has decided to turn its financial attention to modernizing its conventional-speed intercity rps routes. These ordinary, slower-speed routes do continue to require operating assistance funding, but the French HSR network earns enough revenue to cover 100% of its operating costs and, in some cases, nearly all of its capital investment needs.",0,-2.3448879041043744,2.3448879041043744

My argument, which I didn't have enough characters in my last comment to fully develop, is basically that the role of the fully-informed human conscience should reign supreme in such matters. Now I'm aware of the fact that the bishops would say that a fully-informed conscience can never dissent from official church teaching. I'm in fundamental disagreement with them on that, and you can either agree with me or not that that's a valid position to hold. The fact remains that I hold it on a number of issues. So, to answer your question, the applicability of church teaching is not as important to me as the demands of my own conscience. I think the church always wants to make official teaching neat and clean on issues that are inherently messy. I believe that sometimes it's better to learn to live with paradox than avoid it.

The document did not include the social justice issues. I was disappointed to see it so prominently displayed today.",0,-2.169028485261709,2.169028485261709

3898,"Typical liberal--fails to get the point and then goes on an emotional rant.

No one has any problem with empowerment of women.  Got it? As long as empowerment means equal pay for equal work, equal respect, equal chances at advancement, etc, no one has a problem with it.  

Whether abortion on demand and ABC equal empowerment--well, not all agree with that.  In fact I would argue that abortion on demand and contraception lead to oppression of women.  Abortion on demand and contraception cause they very things feminists are trying so hard to change and fight!

Be that as it may.  Married couples can use ABC all they want--if they think it will somehow lead them to freedom or empowerment.  As long as they don't expect the Catholic Church to pay for it--they can do what want.",0,-2.168035803956164,2.168035803956164

I personally do not believe OHA can legally focus funds and objectives specifically for Native Hawaiians. I gave up on OHA when they lost the case against Rice.
But now Mr. Mike Chun is in the mix, I believe there is hope. We have 4 daughters and 4 nephews (boarders from big isle) that graduated from Kamehameha on Mike's watch. Today they are all college graduates and professionals. But most of all they all expressed their love and respect for ""Mr. Chun"".

393,"We were after the County to put a light at Barber/Parcells on Hwy 104 for years, as well as lower the speed limit on 104. They finally got around to the latter by 5mph. But the lanes remain narrow, thanks to the addition of the ferry shoulder after they saw a video I took of this spot before with cars in the center lane zipping by at 55 adjacent to the stalled Sunday ferry lane with people getting out of their cars in between to see what the holdup was. They need to widen the highway at that spot at least. The left turn lanes are frighteningly narrow!

A light would make it much safer - especially for the school busses turning and crossing 104 there. Its only a matter of time before one full of grade schoolers gets hit by a semi-truck rushing to the ferry after the bus stalls or  hesitates as it is trying to climb off of Barber Cutoff . THEN the State will put a light. They told me that the number of fatalities over a given period is the criteria. So far we have been lucky...",0,-2.1632163071902286,2.1632163071902286

You say that libertarians don't give a damn about others when, in reality, America and other countries with more freedom give more to charity than countries with less freedom. Not to mention that socialist comrade Bernie owns three houses and only gave 4% of his annual $200,000 income to charity. 

Comrade FDR, another socialist, lied to my Polish ancestors in 1944 by telling them that their country would be free from tyranny after the war. However, he already made a deal with Stalin the year before in Tehran that comrade Joe would have ALL of Eastern Europe, including Poland, my great grandmother's country of origin.
