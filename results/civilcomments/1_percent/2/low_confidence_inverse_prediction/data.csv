Apologies for reading your name incorrectly.  

The reason for my mistaking your understanding of Witnesses is that your comments suggest that lack.  

For instance, your comments regarding Witness views on blood transfusions suggests an accentuated concern with the medical benefits.  As one who was a Witness, you would understand that a Witness individually chooses to reject blood, in all its many forms, due to a deep respect for Jehovah's view of blood, being sacred, as well as obedience to the direct commands to abstain.   Even if this means one's risk of dying.  Medical benefits are accompanying benefits, not the reason.  However, medical benefits and the present move away from blood by most medical professionals and science underscores the recurring pattern found in the Bible that obedience to God is always beneficial.  

Additionally, your views on the military and the positions of Jehovah's Witnesses shows a lack of understanding.  You refer to Matthew 8:5-13.",1,-0.14273301746508021,0.14273301746508021

Probably it should.  Certainly capitalism (which isn't the same as usury) is injurious and is worth curtailing.  But you're falling into the trap of arguing by analogy.  These 2 issues should be argued on their own merits.  Jesus spoke quite clearly against divorce; that's indisputable.

He did not opine on banking or on governmental policy, because his kingdom was not of this world, and neatly dodged any questions on such topics (eg, rendering unto Caesar).

Why Adventist churches don't ordain or hire in absolute independence is because pastors are employees of the Conference. Adventists have desired that churches which can't afford to pay pastors are provided one, and that pastors be held to a denominational standard rather than a single church's. However, other denominations offer such advantages without financing a top-heavy system such as ours.

So the real question is whether the Pope thinks this principle should be done away with; and if so, whether it's really a good idea to do away with it; and if so, is this something the Pope can even decide.

The problem is that Sharia is not strictly a ""religious law."" It is a law that does not recognize a separation of church and state, it governs both the religious and the secular sphere simultaneously. Therefore, since its significant incompatibilities with Western culture and law, it is prone to create a parallel society.

Religious courts, such as Jewish, Amish, Catholic tribunals are inherently compatible with Western culture and law, since they, the Judeo-Christian tradition, originated both. Therefore the danger for a creation of a parallel society is practically null.

.
The image of Members of Parliament as lazy, or overpaid, or pampered is simply wrong. 
.
I have known elected representatives for a very long time, and none of them who are any good at the job is lazy.  They work incredibly hard.  They have to be patient and tactful with obnoxious people under very trying circumstances.  I have known Conservatives, Liberals, and New Democrats.
.
While there are some elected representatives - and in this the Harper government stands as an outlier - who should never have stood for public office, most of the people I have known who have stood for public office entered public life out of a desire to improve their community and their country.  Almost all of them care deeply about public service.
