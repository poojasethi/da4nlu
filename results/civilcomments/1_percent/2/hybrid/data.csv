These two theological spheres are 'practical' means of seeking understanding via faith (theology). They needn't be bogged down by the arcane terminologies of imperfect philosophies (e.g. Aristotelianism, Thomism) applied in more systematic means of doing theology.

Understanding and expression are very important in the sphere of Liturgy. If we don't allow Liturgy to develop liturgically, but instead use our imperfect philosophical-theological lexicon to supress expression rather than to guide it, then how can we model the parrhesia of the Church that we read about in the Acts of the Apostles?

These thoughts from a spiritual master are a profound challenge for anyone progressive today.

Francis transformed these Rules into a progressive manifesto by saying, no one should have a problem with the gist of these rules provided you understand the Church in V2 terms--God's holy people, not the magisteriuim.  With that simple observation, the focus for finding the Spirit becomes What is happening among the entire Church, including all of the faithful, that matters. It does seem pretty obvious that Francis' Church and the magisterium are not at all pointed in the same direction. 

That is the deeper Francis, IMHO; but given his position and the need to hold this fractious people together, he has to push for open discussion rather than led in the direction he may prefer.

The adjectival phrase 'one in being', I argue, communicates the distinction of Jesus from the rest of humankind, as the Nicaean and Constantinopolitan creeds intended. The adjective 'consubstantial' does the same, albeit in a vocabulary foreign to all individuals, praying in the English language, who are not familiar with Aristotelian metaphysical co-principles, such as matter and form.

Against the New Homophiles he does not see same-sex attraction as a gift “in and of itself.” He insists that any goods “supposedly unique to homosexuality are common to man, and all that is good in man is the result of being made in the image and likeness of God.”

He opposes the New Homophile notion of “gay exceptionalism” flowing from the supposed good of homosexuality. “No,” he says, “the good is the redemptive healing work of God that begins when we honestly acknowledge that homosexuality is a wound” and he says that if same-sex attracted persons take this view they can become “wounded healers.”",0,-0.055038670696103686,0.055038670696103686

1104,"I think you are arguing that since (in your view) left-wing protests are violent, that relative to that, the choice of Bannon shows how gracious Trump is. In short, Trump has a right to revenge for the riots but is being a relative nice guy by hiring Bannon. Isn't that a different argument? 
If that is the root of your argument, I am still having trouble with that. First, the riots covered a few days, whereas Bannon's Breitbart has spewed hatred of minorities for years, though admittedly, without as serious short-term consequences. 
Since you are using the riots as evidence, how many of the Progressive Left were engaged in destruction? According to the police, it's been anarchists. And although it is claimed the protesters are paid, how does that work? Do they get a protest card  punched at each corner? 
But we also know alt-right folks are harassing Muslims and immigrants. Trump even had to tell them to ""stop"". Though not destruction, there are also offenses on the radical Right.",0,0.020073543539804284,0.020073543539804284
