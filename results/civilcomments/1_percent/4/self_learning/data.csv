What we found back then was that the fittest kids have oxygen uptakes ( MVO 2) in the high 70's and one was an 81. For perspective for adults, this put some kids in the range of world class middle distance runners or elite cyclists. Since the majority of kids were pre adolescent, this is quite normal. We noticed that once the kids hit high school their oxygen uptakes dramatically decreased. 
So what I'm saying is that if we influence children with regular exercise when their young, then their natural drop off will be less when they hit puberty. 
Picard is right. Kids are meant to move constantly. A 15 minute run/ brisk walk is a start. Not a solution. Everything fitness related starts at home very early. Parents can be a solution . It can start by walking to school, less screen time, more family activities where fitness in normal. Just like the 70's.",0,-3.1669971454623127,3.1669971454623127

She reviewed the number of returns she submitted last year the APTC percentage was less than 1% (.007 %) of submitted returns.  Note:  APTC is not given to those on Medicare.  The APTC applies to those individuals that do not qualify for Medicaid and fall below the income level that would qualify them for a tax credit (which the APTC).  However interestingly we rely on prior year's income (2016) reported by the taxpayer to qualify for APTC of upcoming year (2017).  Upon filing for 2017, if taxpayer understated or simply had reported above the estimate, the credit is paid back when filing taxes.  Hence, the if we back out the Medicaid recipients (who were a large percentage of ACA enrollees) the 90% seems a bit askew.

My advice to pastors whose churches are affiliated with schools - spend at least a day a week at your local church school.  And if you have a local academy spend another day a week there.  There is no substitute for personal connection between pastors and educators and students.  Remember that your children spend five days a week there, and their parents a lot of time as well.

First, it is a practical work-around to the Pharisaical preoccupation with legal formulations that has gripped the institutional Church in matters related to marriage and the family.

Second, a pastoral focus gives breathing room for people to center themselves on the Spirit of Christ in their hearts.  This centering moves toward the reign of God that Jesus preached.

Muller and the four cardinals don't appreciate how much distance there is from the Church when a person struggling to discern their conscience cannot be confident that a pastor will encourage that discernment.  Francis is encouraging that discernment.

And, in the end, that discernment restores the primacy of the great commandments to love God and neighbor.  Lack of ""exceptions"" to a subordinate principle -- such as indissolubility -- risks denying the primacy of love.",0,-2.670500201893374,2.670500201893374

We knew what it was because his mother has it, but since we were not insured - I was in a waiting period before qualifying through my work - and preexisting conditions would place a yearlong hold on coverage under my employer's insurance plan, we did not dare go to a doctor until we were covered. Because of this, he spent a year suffering from an untreated degenerative disease that left him barely able to walk. He spent most days sitting in a chair. Once he was diagnosed, and after the insurance company had (literally - we heard about it from friends) called every relevant doctor in town to confirm that he had not been diagnosed before, he received treatment that changed him from chair-bound to walking overnight.

I appreciate your breakdown of the three groups and their motivations for wanting to control or purify the church. The common thread I have observed among all three is an incomplete surrender of their sinful self to the redeeming power of God. Often a person who is trying to control others is really trying to find a way to soothe the innate discomfort they are feeling in their own relationship with God. 

I praise God that He is able to give us victory over sin, fill us with His peace and then utterly amaze us with what He is able to do through us. So I say with confidence that, if God can do the things I've seen Him do through me, then there is a whole lot of opportunity for others to allow God to do at least as much in whomever He picks, even calling women to serve in church leadership positions where so many men have failed.",0,-2.4497987579802953,2.4497987579802953
