Yes, the abusive pimp/prostitute relationship is terrible, but that mostly exists because of the illegality of prostitution.

People who feel patriotic at a time when they believe our country is under attack do not hear the protest, they only hear the attack on our country.  People who pay good money to attend games or to buy NFL gear do not hear the protest, they hear rich men insulting their country by kneeling for the National Anthem.  People who hear about black on black crime don't hear the protest of black millionaires, all they hear is hypocrisy when blacks complain about the cops who protect them from other blacks.  The general population doesn't want to hear that blacks are being mistreated from the mouths of black men who are treated very well.

We'd be far better off doing as Mssrs Trudeau, Morneau and McCallum are thinking -- open our borders to cultures where people understand hard work and that not every job can be comfy, safe and lucrative.",1,0.002753128602186905,0.002753128602186905

3614,"Agreed, it's a shameful waste of money.  I really like the women's prison idea because a) the expanded capacity is already budgeted b) it would save the cost of reopening the ""mothballed"" Salem facility, c) the JC facility is ready for use as a prison with little or no cost to repurpose d) it would free up money for community-based services e) it would preserve many of those jobs now associated with the hospital and e) it would save tens of millions in operations cost.  Again, I hope the ""decision makers"" are willing to entertain alternatives rather than just, as you phrase it, ""throwing good money after bad.""  regards, Gary Crum",0,0.0017614799219618504,0.0017614799219618504
