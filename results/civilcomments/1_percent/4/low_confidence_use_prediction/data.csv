Mr. Briggs makes the mistake of thinking that a Council would take on the contentious issues of the day and be able to find a good solution for them.  Biggs forgets that the success of V2 was because it rose above dogmatic thinking (which is where we are today) and infused the Church with pastoral and restorative grace that too many current bishops and our past two popes never quite grasped well enough.

2. God's will is expressed also in the events that He allows in our life, the sequence of events and people that surround us.  God wills most people to be share in His creative power, by having and being in families. Fecundity is His will for most.

3. God speaks also to us through reason. It's reasonable to conclude that we are limited human beings, that we don't have infinite anything.  We are finite.    We can't love everyone with the same availability and sensitivity.  We have limited time, energy, attention span. 

4. So reason tells us that the people God wants most of us to love the most, are those that he places closet to us.

My understanding is that only a very small percentage of abortions affect late-term pregnancies, and also that the option of abortion is chosen at this point usually only on account of dire medical considerations, and usually against the original expectation of the woman to bring her pregnancy to term and give birth.

Also, with mid-term and late-term pregnancies, my understanding is that more women do indeed then begin to appreciate the reality of the human-beingness (word?) of the fetus they are bearing, and so perhaps also the separate interests of that being.

That's incorrect. There's nothing about either sympathy or compassion that requires taking a side. 

The taking of sides is a strategic act, typically informed by both cognitive and emotional factors. Once a side is chosen, it tends to interfere with normal feelings of empathy and compassion. For example, when a player on the opposing team is injured, you're less likely to feel empathy for him than you would if it was a player on the team you support.

At least from a Buddhist's point of view, compassion can take no side. It's not an emotion. It's a state of being that's given freely to every living thing, without moralizing or politicizing the circumstances. Empathy on the other hand is an emotional connection between you and someone else, typically due to difficult circumstances the other is experiencing.",1,0.8078865899433891,0.8078865899433891

 Things are very different now & new parameters must be employed. In the past there were no large bureaucracies anxious to add to new clients to the welfare roles. In fact immigrants -like citizens - had to fend for themselves.

I appreciate your breakdown of the three groups and their motivations for wanting to control or purify the church. The common thread I have observed among all three is an incomplete surrender of their sinful self to the redeeming power of God. Often a person who is trying to control others is really trying to find a way to soothe the innate discomfort they are feeling in their own relationship with God. 

I praise God that He is able to give us victory over sin, fill us with His peace and then utterly amaze us with what He is able to do through us.

For perspective for adults, this put some kids in the range of world class middle distance runners or elite cyclists. Since the majority of kids were pre adolescent, this is quite normal. We noticed that once the kids hit high school their oxygen uptakes dramatically decreased. 
So what I'm saying is that if we influence children with regular exercise when their young, then their natural drop off will be less when they hit puberty. 
Picard is right. Kids are meant to move constantly. A 15 minute run/ brisk walk is a start. Not a solution. Everything fitness related starts at home very early. Parents can be a solution .

Second, a pastoral focus gives breathing room for people to center themselves on the Spirit of Christ in their hearts.  This centering moves toward the reign of God that Jesus preached.

Muller and the four cardinals don't appreciate how much distance there is from the Church when a person struggling to discern their conscience cannot be confident that a pastor will encourage that discernment.  Francis is encouraging that discernment.

But these things need not be so and are not always so.

Fortunately for Yours Truly and my good wife (a SDA church school teacher), we are blessed to be part of a local church that pulls together with our (multi-church) school.

My advice to pastors whose churches are affiliated with schools - spend at least a day a week at your local church school.  And if you have a local academy spend another day a week there.  There is no substitute for personal connection between pastors and educators and students.  Remember that your children spend five days a week there, and their parents a lot of time as well.

The approximately 9,021 Lane County Social Security recipients receive, on average, $1,331 per month.  They are scheduled to get a 2.0 percent raise in January--although for many, that 'raise' is non-existent because it has to go for Part B Medicare.  

That is because they received no 'raise' last year and the year before was also small and that wasn't enough to cover the increase in Part B costs from those years.    

Whether they rent or own, they are paying Lane County property taxes where they live.

Why should they have to pay more to support those making three to four times their own fixed income?

Essentially both systems follow the same standard curriculum set by the province. Catholic schools add the religious perspective. 
Some schools get a better reputation by the teachers they can attract. From my observation of a small sample of 2, I didn't see much difference except since my younger son was a founding year student, he was getting some advantage by a smaller class size and the need of the staff to build a reputation. The school gained popularity and the principal planned to increase the number of students beyond the number he promised as a limit.

This is important.  There needs to be not just some vague ""consult the laity and religious"" but a structure that assures there is a forum in which to make their ideas are made known.  Perhaps how this is structured is another one of those things that needs to be set up by national bishops' conferences, so that differences in culture, education levels in the society, and what typically divides - such as tribal affiliations in Africa - are considered.  

Our bishops need to have an accountability not just to the pope, but to the people they supposedly lead.
