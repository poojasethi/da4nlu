Consistent with his fellow “up, not out” true believers, Mueller provides us no facts and the most casual analysis reveals glaring inconsistencies.

Let’s start with “the greater good involves keeping our wonderful city within its current boundaries …” Exactly why are the current boundaries optimal? They were drawn under a radically smaller population and much different conditions in the southern Willamette Valley.

That's incorrect. There's nothing about either sympathy or compassion that requires taking a side. 

The taking of sides is a strategic act, typically informed by both cognitive and emotional factors. Once a side is chosen, it tends to interfere with normal feelings of empathy and compassion. For example, when a player on the opposing team is injured, you're less likely to feel empathy for him than you would if it was a player on the team you support.

At least from a Buddhist's point of view, compassion can take no side. It's not an emotion. It's a state of being that's given freely to every living thing, without moralizing or politicizing the circumstances. Empathy on the other hand is an emotional connection between you and someone else, typically due to difficult circumstances the other is experiencing.",0,1.5636382819210568,1.5636382819210568

It is the development of a ""sweet tooth"" that's trained from guilt-free consumption of artificially sweetened foods and drink.    i.e. people consume sweet food and end up consuming more sugar because their taste buds now crave it.

If you look at sugar consumption in the U.S.  - it shows a rapid rise beginning in the early 80's when artificial sweeteners were really marketed heavily.    So overall sugar consumption jumped even though artificial sweeteners were introduced.     People started craving more sweet things.

THEY believed that it was their mission from Christ to reach as many as possible to save them from the ""last days.""  It was ONLY after the persecutions---that the groups of Christians all around the Middle East and the Mediterranean, and their elected [cheirotonesate] leaders, called 'episkopoi' or bishops, realized that maybe the world wasn't ending 'right away'.  They did gather in local little groups to discuss issues, but it wasn't until after the Treaty of Milan in 311, that they began to see themselves a large gathering called an 'ekklesia'.  That was when the church began.

I appreciate your breakdown of the three groups and their motivations for wanting to control or purify the church. The common thread I have observed among all three is an incomplete surrender of their sinful self to the redeeming power of God.

I praise God that He is able to give us victory over sin, fill us with His peace and then utterly amaze us with what He is able to do through us.

Second, a pastoral focus gives breathing room for people to center themselves on the Spirit of Christ in their hearts.  This centering moves toward the reign of God that Jesus preached.

Muller and the four cardinals don't appreciate how much distance there is from the Church when a person struggling to discern their conscience cannot be confident that a pastor will encourage that discernment.  Francis is encouraging that discernment.

The APTC applies to those individuals that do not qualify for Medicaid and fall below the income level that would qualify them for a tax credit (which the APTC).

We noticed that once the kids hit high school their oxygen uptakes dramatically decreased. 
So what I'm saying is that if we influence children with regular exercise when their young, then their natural drop off will be less when they hit puberty. 
Picard is right. Kids are meant to move constantly. A 15 minute run/ brisk walk is a start. Not a solution. Everything fitness related starts at home very early. Parents can be a solution .
