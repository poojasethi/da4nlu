2. God's will is expressed also in the events that He allows in our life, the sequence of events and people that surround us.  God wills most people to be share in His creative power, by having and being in families. Fecundity is His will for most.

3. God speaks also to us through reason. It's reasonable to conclude that we are limited human beings, that we don't have infinite anything.  We are finite.    We can't love everyone with the same availability and sensitivity.  We have limited time, energy, attention span. 

4. So reason tells us that the people God wants most of us to love the most, are those that he places closet to us.  He does ask a few people to do missionary work, but most of us are to love very ordinarily, and yet still heroically, right where we are, loving those near us.",0,-4.705799452094903,4.705799452094903

 Many experiement with eastern religion, which does not emphasize doctrine. Buddhism especially attracts  because of its emphasis on compassion, providing group support and tools (such as meditation) as help on the spiritual journey.  They do not seek out some other version of what they left.

Second, a pastoral focus gives breathing room for people to center themselves on the Spirit of Christ in their hearts.  This centering moves toward the reign of God that Jesus preached.

Muller and the four cardinals don't appreciate how much distance there is from the Church when a person struggling to discern their conscience cannot be confident that a pastor will encourage that discernment.  Francis is encouraging that discernment.

I appreciate your breakdown of the three groups and their motivations for wanting to control or purify the church. The common thread I have observed among all three is an incomplete surrender of their sinful self to the redeeming power of God. Often a person who is trying to control others is really trying to find a way to soothe the innate discomfort they are feeling in their own relationship with God. 

I praise God that He is able to give us victory over sin, fill us with His peace and then utterly amaze us with what He is able to do through us. So I say with confidence that, if God can do the things I've seen Him do through me, then there is a whole lot of opportunity for others to allow God to do at least as much in whomever He picks, even calling women to serve in church leadership positions where so many men have failed.",0,-3.384696073047006,3.384696073047006

We knew what it was because his mother has it, but since we were not insured - I was in a waiting period before qualifying through my work - and preexisting conditions would place a yearlong hold on coverage under my employer's insurance plan, we did not dare go to a doctor until we were covered. Because of this, he spent a year suffering from an untreated degenerative disease that left him barely able to walk. He spent most days sitting in a chair. Once he was diagnosed, and after the insurance company had (literally - we heard about it from friends) called every relevant doctor in town to confirm that he had not been diagnosed before, he received treatment that changed him from chair-bound to walking overnight. 

My husband has a chronic disease. Treatment is prohibitively expensive without coverage. A return to lifetime limits and preexisting condition clauses could make him uninsurable. We need the ACA.",0,-3.3761169876152906,3.3761169876152906

But really, there are two issues here, and the second is the culture making adult to adult sexual contact for money illegal. 
Personally, I think if we are a culture that cherishes freedoms and adult choice, prostitution should be legal. Why does one adult have the right to tell another adult how to live, if no one is being hurt?
Yes, the abusive pimp/prostitute relationship is terrible, but that mostly exists because of the illegality of prostitution. 
I grew up in a culture that made lotteries, porn,  and weed very illegal, as was prostitution. I think now all should be legalized.

Saying ""she's a bitch"" is not a defense to sexual harassment, and if that's the best the company can come up with, I'm pretty sure the allegations are truthful. Shit man, they didn't even have the balls to call her a bitch using their own name, they had to make Williamson do their dirty work for them. 

In any case, Hobbs is an owner and founder of the company, which means, bitch or not (and really, aren't we all bitches when we complain about our bosses?), they can't take her business away from her.
