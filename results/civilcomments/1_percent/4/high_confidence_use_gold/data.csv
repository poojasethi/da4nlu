4101,"1.  Not everything that God has said or says to us was spoken by the few hundred words that have been captured in the Gospels.    Some people seem ever desirous to shrink God's word (and will).

2. God's will is expressed also in the events that He allows in our life, the sequence of events and people that surround us.  God wills most people to be share in His creative power, by having and being in families. Fecundity is His will for most.

3. God speaks also to us through reason. It's reasonable to conclude that we are limited human beings, that we don't have infinite anything.  We are finite.    We can't love everyone with the same availability and sensitivity.  We have limited time, energy, attention span. 

4. So reason tells us that the people God wants most of us to love the most, are those that he places closet to us.  He does ask a few people to do missionary work, but most of us are to love very ordinarily, and yet still heroically, right where we are, loving those near us.",0,-4.11646529992483,4.11646529992483

Picard is right. Kids are meant to move constantly. A 15 minute run/ brisk walk is a start. Not a solution. Everything fitness related starts at home very early. Parents can be a solution .

The early Christians understood that it was the Risen Lord himself who was calling them to get together to celebrate all he meant to them, and that is was he himself who led them in their celebrations from start to finish.

Fortunately for Yours Truly and my good wife (a SDA church school teacher), we are blessed to be part of a local church that pulls together with our (multi-church) school.

Retirement contribution typically 4% (most employers match up to 4%)
Housing= $16,752 a year.Two-bedrooms carry an average rent of $1,396, which is $192 more expensive than the national average for a two-bedroom apartment. For a three-bedroom apartment you can expect to pay around the Colorado average rent of $1,744.  
Health Insurance= $10,000 for HDHP So remember additional costs for copay's based on Kaiser data.

90% of Average households report spending $3,000 a year on gas

This is important.  There needs to be not just some vague ""consult the laity and religious"" but a structure that assures there is a forum in which to make their ideas are made known.  Perhaps how this is structured is another one of those things that needs to be set up by national bishops' conferences, so that differences in culture, education levels in the society, and what typically divides - such as tribal affiliations in Africa - are considered.  

Our bishops need to have an accountability not just to the pope, but to the people they supposedly lead.

The Catholic Church sought protection of the First Amendment.  Public schools in this era promoted and often mandated prayer which was not challenged by the public and/or courts.  All this changed in the latter part of 19th Century when through IMMIGRATION the Protestant grip over the nation had weakened.

Second, a pastoral focus gives breathing room for people to center themselves on the Spirit of Christ in their hearts.  This centering moves toward the reign of God that Jesus preached.

Muller and the four cardinals don't appreciate how much distance there is from the Church when a person struggling to discern their conscience cannot be confident that a pastor will encourage that discernment.  Francis is encouraging that discernment.

And, in the end, that discernment restores the primacy of the great commandments to love God and neighbor.  Lack of ""exceptions"" to a subordinate principle -- such as indissolubility -- risks denying the primacy of love.",0,-2.991737932610887,2.991737932610887

I appreciate your breakdown of the three groups and their motivations for wanting to control or purify the church. The common thread I have observed among all three is an incomplete surrender of their sinful self to the redeeming power of God. Often a person who is trying to control others is really trying to find a way to soothe the innate discomfort they are feeling in their own relationship with God. 

I praise God that He is able to give us victory over sin, fill us with His peace and then utterly amaze us with what He is able to do through us.

But he tells us that requires justice, which is one of his cardinal qualities.   To gift men true freedom, meant the potential for rebellion.

There are people with backgrounds in Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, animism, etc. who call themselves Unitarians.  Unitarianism has no creed, no specific concept of God(s).  In fact, they are very proud to have no creed, because they think creeds cause divisiveness between people who believe or don't believe in them.

However, Zosimus himself died in late 418 and Pelegius tried to reopen the case again. This time Augustine used lay contacts (and a hefty bribe) at the imperial court to come down against Pelagius.

It is the development of a ""sweet tooth"" that's trained from guilt-free consumption of artificially sweetened foods and drink.    i.e. people consume sweet food and end up consuming more sugar because their taste buds now crave it.

If you look at sugar consumption in the U.S.  - it shows a rapid rise beginning in the early 80's when artificial sweeteners were really marketed heavily.    So overall sugar consumption jumped even though artificial sweeteners were introduced.     People started craving more sweet things.

Mueller appears to have consumed a copious amount of the “density uber alles” Kool-Aid, and his sloppy attempt at a “folksy” style suggests some enrichment with CH3CH2O – “They are gonna come …”, “Au contraire,” “It just ain’t so,” “There you go again.” I’m surprised Mueller didn’t end his piece with “‘Nuff said.”

Consistent with his fellow “up, not out” true believers, Mueller provides us no facts and the most casual analysis reveals glaring inconsistencies.

Let’s start with “the greater good involves keeping our wonderful city within its current boundaries …” Exactly why are the current boundaries optimal?

2173,"""Based on the authors examples of Trump and vaccines, the author is talking about sympathy and compassion, both of which require of us to take sides.""

That's incorrect. There's nothing about either sympathy or compassion that requires taking a side. 

The taking of sides is a strategic act, typically informed by both cognitive and emotional factors. Once a side is chosen, it tends to interfere with normal feelings of empathy and compassion. For example, when a player on the opposing team is injured, you're less likely to feel empathy for him than you would if it was a player on the team you support.

At least from a Buddhist's point of view, compassion can take no side. It's not an emotion. It's a state of being that's given freely to every living thing, without moralizing or politicizing the circumstances. Empathy on the other hand is an emotional connection between you and someone else, typically due to difficult circumstances the other is experiencing.",0,-2.486205756044608,2.486205756044608

The methods covered by the pharmacy benefit are hormonal (e.g., birth control pills), barrier (i.e., diaphragms), emergency contraceptives (i.e., “morning after” pills) and select over-the-counter (OTC) contraceptives. Contraceptives on our Preventive Care Medication List are covered at 100 percent when age- and gender-appropriate, prescribed by a health care professional and filled at a network pharmacy. 
Here are some changes to our contraceptive coverage to comply with health reform: 
    * Certain OTC contraceptives for women are covered at 100 percent including female condoms, emergency contraceptives (Next ChoiceTM, Next Choice One-DoseTM, Plan B One-Step®), and contraceptive film, foam and gel.

4159,The method that haters of Muslims use is to deflect from the question of Islamophobia by wrapping it together with all the other religious groups. That way you never have to deal with the issue directly which is exactly what the Conservative Party is attempting to do since they have been underhandedly promoting Islamophobia for years.  These are people who would describe slavery in the US without talking about blacks.  These people will advocate individually for other groups but of course never directly for Muslims since they draw large support from a community of Islamophobes such as the ones that like to blog in the Globe and Mail..,0,2.4614491733872867,2.4614491733872867
553,"Yes,  Father Z and CM can be called ""far right.""   But they're only a tiny segment of those Catholics who disagree with fr. Martin's views.

So it's really not accurate to say, as this article does, that only the ""far right"" of Catholicism has a problem with fr. Martin's book.   Both Crux and the other NCR panned the book.   Both have very large readerships, and therefore neither can fairly dubbed and dismissed as ""far right"" Catholic publications.

Also, why are we to be  impressed that 5 bishops went on record to approve of the book?  There are 255 active bishops in the U.S.   Why then do only 5 give the book a thumbs up?   Dare we say they represent the ""far left"" of Catholic opinion?",0,-2.4611422836923413,2.4611422836923413

1088,"If you mean to imply that 'one in being' *does not* have a specific meaning as does 'consubstantial', then I disagree.

As an expression of the relationship between Jesus & the Father, 'one', as in ""I & the Father are one...,"" predates the medieval philosophical term, 'consubstantial', which is an attempt to apply an Aristotelian metaphysical co-principle to Catholic theology. And the author of the Gospel according to John had a ""specific meaning"" in mind when he had Jesus speak them.

I also disagree with your assertion that ""No further qualification is required"" for the adjectives 'consubstantial/homoousios'. I'm more sure of the need for qualification and/or deeper catechesis on these terms than I am about their very meaning. I recently spoke to 2 practicing Catholic friends about the term 'consubstantial'; one admitted ignorance of its meaning & the other confused it with 'transubstantiation'.

On HART's monthly report for April 2016, however, they only reported $158,655,626, for a difference of about $455,400.

2233,"I don't quite understand exactly what Pope Francis is trying to achieve. I think he is genuinely interested in integrating a broader intellectual approach to these issues. I am a scientist myself and I don't oppose that. But what is getting missed in this discussion is that this is not a debate about the science of foetuses and abortion. It is a discussion about the intrinsic VALUE of a human person, and the position of the church should be clear that the question of the VALUE of human life is not only a MORAL debate, but it has a spiritual dimension also.  If we were simply talking about moral values, then Nigel Biggar would probably be correct. But we are not only talking about human morals. The Church teaches us that the the spiritual dimension exists above the moral dimension and it is established NOT by whether the foetus is conscious or capable of thought, but by the power and will of God from the point of conception onwards.",0,-2.448983692454897,2.448983692454897

1602,"Catholic sacramental theology teaches that a specific intention is not necessary. Only a deliberate contrary intention invalidates a sacrament. Most people, Catholics especially, who marry for the first time will initially intend to stay together for the rest of their lives and this is sufficient for a valid marriage. A marriage is always presumed to be valid unless it can be proved otherwise and that is the purpose of the tribunal.

Since it is specifically an FN issue I would have thought that there would/should be some membership of FN comissioners to represent FN interests in the matter. But in any case it is doubtful that there will be earth shattering revelations of  gross misconduct by anybody involved in previous investigations.

The truly fundamental and root cause that needs airing is the dysfunctional remote reserve culture that induces FN women and girls to abandon their home environment and expose themselves to the risks inherent in entering an urban experience they are not prepared for. 

That does not in any way absolve anybody - but is absolutely necessary to evolve a policy and strategy of advancement and integration into modern society. That is the only Inquiry I am interested in.",0,-2.447007329710003,2.447007329710003
