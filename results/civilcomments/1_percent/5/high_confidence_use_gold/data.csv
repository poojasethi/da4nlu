What is missing is any relationship with the congregation.  Instead of focusing on the full, conscious, and active participation of all present as was repeatedly sought by the bishops of the Second Vatican Council, this is another clergy focused, theological exercise.

4112,"Faith gives people confidence to work in areas of ambiguity. People who have a strong faith do not need to deal in black and white, for example. You don't say what your faith is, but Christians, for example, are exhorted to justify their faith to anyone who demands an accounting of it. In other words., our faith is accountable to the greater good, and the larger definition of what that greater good might be.

To be able to flip through the Bible and find a heartless rule that says this or that is not faith. That's more like developing a belief system that takes away the responsibility of  letting the holy speak through one's own life, choosing, instead, to let the holy speak through the lives of people who lived in antiquity.

And yes, faith communities do lots of good things. But they can also spend a lot of their energy and good will in the argument that they ought to have the resources of the larger community to do that. The ice is a little thinner over there.",0,-2.783848645511713,2.783848645511713

I can hear sound but not distinct words. It is painful to sit and listen for fifteen minutes and be unable to follow what is said.

The whole problem with dissenting theologians is precisely that they do not understand their proper role.  The role of the theologian is to show how what the Church teaches is contained in the sources of revelation.

2265,"Groucho,

I should have been more clear in my view. I do not believe for one second that scripture prohibits having women in leadership positions, but I also understand that when Paul's statements are taken without considering the social situation that a person can easily be against it. The issue about which we should be most concerned is not gender, but if a person is gifted by the Holy Spirit. So long as you eliminate people from consideration just because they are female, you are severely limiting the potential of the church to fulfill the mission Jesus gave us to do.",0,-2.394218672996466,2.394218672996466
3802,"Consultations are simply advisory recommendations. There are no mechanisms in the  Vat. II constitutions or canon law to allow the laity to participate in anything but a consultative role. And while the idea sounds appealing, the reality is that if these consultations were to be conducted as some dioceses do for  a parish receiving a new pastor, they would be a waste of time. Everyone wants a man with xyz characteristics for which even  Jesus might be disqualified. There is no ability for the laity to honestly look at a slate of potential candidates, just a boiler-plate descriptive of their ideal.",0,-2.3935689163610396,2.3935689163610396

3606,"It's not Bernini,  but it is art. In Europe Marxism had a much greater influence than we Americans are accustomed to. Social justice entered the art vocabulary, especially in Italian art. Fascism was a direct response to the power of Socialism in Italy back in the day. In Hawaii, we are much more attuned to socialism due to our close relationship with China. The piece illustrated is one of those social justice pieces. Pistoletto has other sculpture much more in tune with classical vibes. Italian art is among the greatest on Earth, for all times. It rivals the French art we are most familiar with and the New York art post world war two that became American art. We are lucky to have this kind of sophistication arriving on our distant shores. It matches the sophistication of the new director of the museum started by the Cookes, who were very tuned in to, say, the Hans Hoffman generation.",0,-2.3843927386622474,2.3843927386622474

These are just two examples along with their continued fixation to build trails within the Front Country without consideration for human/bear conflicts (which we had in 2016 - where the NPS response was highly suspect). 

One shouldn't have to question NPS but in Denali's case I do, due to their past & current history. The question is: is it better to starve NPS of funding within Denali to better protect Denali from NPS & their continued desire to domesticate, partition, & degrade the park? 

It used to be that Denali was considered a Wilderness Park & that we (meaning the entire Denali community) took great pride in that; unfortunately & apparently, NPS no longer shares in that view.",0,-2.3805814994608028,2.3805814994608028

Another: Charles Murray's ""Human Achievement."" With those above, that's 4. As well as copious Internet research. Of course, it's not just ""knowledge,"" but what one does with it. The ancient Greeks in the end were ""stillborn"" on science. It just ended. As did Islamic science. Whereas science since the Catholic Middle Ages has been a going concern because Catholics developed scientific method. It's religion, specifically the Catholic Religion, that gave people a reason and a way of thinking that made science a going concern. In particular, as all these scholars pointed out, St. Thomas Aquinas solved the problem of faith vs. reason by showing there was no conflict, and where conflict seemed to exit, it really was limited human knowledge that needed to be advanced.",0,-2.3792444927212077,2.3792444927212077

As a person who works in the private sector AND the public sector, people will often comment that the public job must be rewarding for what it does for society. I have found that rather odd. It implies that if you do something good for society, you get less pay. So if you are in a for-profit you get more but don't help society?",0,-2.3717150247360754,2.3717150247360754
