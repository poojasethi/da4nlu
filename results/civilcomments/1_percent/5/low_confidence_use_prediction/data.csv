If bishops were as cynical as you, they would conversely, as it were, want to drop from 75 million to 25 million US Catholics (certainly not retain more as you suggest).

And after selling off the assets, properties of closed parishes, for billions, they could advisedly invest that money (as do the Mormons, Catholic Churches in Germany and India, and elsewhere) and do quite well.

A solution is needed - on how to balance the budget when increasing salaries and benefits so that unfair burden is not placed on the taxpayer.

I've read elsewhere that in Hawaii, for cost-of-living adjustments, and with the addition of benefits, here's how average annual wages + benefits currently stack up:  
  
Private Sector Worker - $55,432; 
State Worker - $68,216; 
County Worker - $86,712.

Government Sector Benefits have grown 5x faster than in Private Sector.

Unfunded liabilities for local government benefits are now $23Billion, highest in state's history.

What you really fail at understanding is that I am anti-abortion.  I've stated that many times before.  But I am not in favor of imposing that belief (which, BTW, was a long journey from my original position) on others through the means you and others push.  I am convinced that if we as faithful Christians who witness to the sanctity of life in ALL of its forms, provide the most compassionate and relevant programs and services, we will begin to see real progress in reducing the rate of abortions.  The Church is rather two-faced about it, in my opinion: it speaks of how precious the life of the unborn is, and then does little in actual intervention to really truly help women who face difficult pregnancies (none are easy) to choose carrying to full term.

What is missing is any relationship with the congregation.  Instead of focusing on the full, conscious, and active participation of all present as was repeatedly sought by the bishops of the Second Vatican Council, this is another clergy focused, theological exercise.

With that simple observation, the focus for finding the Spirit becomes What is happening among the entire Church, including all of the faithful, that matters. It does seem pretty obvious that Francis' Church and the magisterium are not at all pointed in the same direction. 

That is the deeper Francis, IMHO; but given his position and the need to hold this fractious people together, he has to push for open discussion rather than led in the direction he may prefer.

I mention this in no small part because as she notes, we're ""due"" for another such period.  From what I can tell, there most certainly appears to be sufficient internal stress within the church to drive that kind of upheaval.  We may not be able to predict how this will play out, but I think we're seeing the start of this in the church today.",1,0.45483803850385884,0.45483803850385884

The Classical Canons of Rhetoric include Invention, Disposition, Style, Delivery, and Memory.  It would seem that seminary training does an adequate job of stressing all of Canons except delivery. The concept of ""talk more slowly""  means little ether practically  or quantifiably the stress should be placed on articulation especially of all vowels and consonants: the word is ""probably"" not ""prolly.""  Volume needs to be maintained until the end of the sentence and not swallowed up in an ibreath gulp.

3644,"I don't usually roll through all the posts, but I wanted to see if anyone recognized that much of what is mentioned is what 'compelled' Vatican II to acknowledge the presence of the laity who had for decades - or more - simply looked at the back of the priest, who whispered in Latin , in a building that was designed for visual impact not --- acoustics. There was a massive pipe organ that drowned out everything from the back pew to the high altar. It was more important to see the priest during the homily than to hear him. The rosary people pressed on regardless through to the final amen.

Enter...Vatican II, Liturgical reform, Mass in vernacular, facing the assembly... but no one can really remedy the church structures/buildings that were never designed for -- full active conscious participation in the liturgy and have merely been 'adapted' to that purpose. New constructions take that in a bit more.

except for these, people-based faith, hope and love, chaos prevails. It's for institutions, churches included, to recognize and authenticate people in faith/hope/love, communication/consciousness/conscience - the trinitarian dynamic of godlikeness.

WE will never achieve the mission that Jesus gave us.  HE will achieve the mission.

The church we attend will have its Nth baptism of the year today, rain or shine.  We are on a trajectory to baptize at least 15% x present membership, as new members this year.

Mathematically, early growth ratios are difficult and ultimately impossible to sustain on a long-term basis.  Every ""market"" eventually reaches saturation.  If the Apostolic church had maintained its initial growth ratio for even a single decade, the entire world would have been baptized.

I do not fault the internal church PR mills for trying to foster a ""can do"" attitude among the members.  That is their job, though some may do it better than others.  We can celebrate whatever and wherever we see signs of God moving among us.
