These thoughts from a spiritual master are a profound challenge for anyone progressive today.

Francis transformed these Rules into a progressive manifesto by saying, no one should have a problem with the gist of these rules provided you understand the Church in V2 terms--God's holy people, not the magisteriuim.  With that simple observation, the focus for finding the Spirit becomes What is happening among the entire Church, including all of the faithful, that matters. It does seem pretty obvious that Francis' Church and the magisterium are not at all pointed in the same direction. 

That is the deeper Francis, IMHO; but given his position and the need to hold this fractious people together, he has to push for open discussion rather than led in the direction he may prefer.

That refers to LEGISLATIVE powers, meaning only the House and Senate can legislate. The other two branches can't. The government as a whole derives its power from the people.

Neither the national or state governments were truly self-governing. Both derived their authority from the consent of the governed.

What is missing is any relationship with the congregation.  Instead of focusing on the full, conscious, and active participation of all present as was repeatedly sought by the bishops of the Second Vatican Council, this is another clergy focused, theological exercise.

- By way of an historical moment: in the US separation and divorce was very discouraged. Indeed, a divorced women was held with little regard even by clergy. Indeed, divorce for a woman was a a sure indicator of a future of destitution.  In US catholic literature on marriage in those days, especially written for pastors, there was no, 'if he hits you, then leave'. More like: 'if he hits you, then try harder to love him and be a good wife.'
- So, while grandmother might have known that the US bishop rescinded in 1884 their 1840 degree that divorce incurs automatic excommunication, she would be still certain that her vows meant something, and that her church, in those days, would have little sympathy for her as divorced or separated.",0,-2.5528955513547205,2.5528955513547205
