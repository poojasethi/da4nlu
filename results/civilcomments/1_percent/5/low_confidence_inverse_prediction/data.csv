“Phoebe (Koine Greek Φοίβη) was a first-century Christian woman mentioned by the Apostle Paul in his Epistle to the Romans, verses 16:1-2. A notable woman in the church of Cenchreae, she was trusted by Paul to deliver his letter to the Romans.[1] In writing to the church that almost surely met in her home,[2] Paul refers to her both as a deacon (Gk. diakonon masc.) and as a helper or patron of many (Gk. prostatis). This is the only place in the New Testament where a woman is specifically referred to with these two distinctions. Paul introduces Phoebe as his emissary to the church in Rome and, because they are not acquainted with her, Paul provides them with her credentials.”",1,-0.1456722335503713,0.1456722335503713

As the article says, ""Historically, every country from Israel to the U.S. to China has always been led by public investments which directly create a new landscape. The business community reacts, gets interested. And then if you add some tax breaks, that will increase the marginal spending but it won’t make them do what they wouldn’t have done anyway. So that’s [why we need] additionality, getting firms to do what they would not have done anyway. In countries like Canada, there is too much reliance on indirect tax breaks that just make the companies richer. The point of policy is not to increase profits, it’s to increase investments.""

Keep in mind that reserve classification is based on the commodity price, associated regulatory costs, transportation cost, extraction costs, and associated royalty and taxes. If the State wants to see known / proven reserves plummet to possible reserves, all the State needs to do is to create a property tax rate based on the reserve category.  Trying to put a property tax on oil in the ground is not like a property tax for a visually inspectable asset.

What State of Alaska regulatory department has the regulatory wizards that could create a valuation methodology that reflects reality without major distortions in shifting reserve classifications: AOGCC, DNR, or DOR?

Just because the nominal wage, which is what you're referring to, increases does not guarantee that the real wage, the wage after prices have fully adjusted, will increase. The reason for this is that businesses need a way to compensate for the loss in profit. There are two ways they can fix this. 

First, businesses can increase their prices, which will only decrease the consumer's/worker's purchasing power, or the ability to afford a certain amount of goods. Thus, making them worse off. 

Second, businesses can lay off workers and replace them with cheaper technology that can do the same job. 

So to go back to your example, the worker making 16k would make more but not be able to afford as much stuff or lose their job and make 0K.

Apologies for reading your name incorrectly.  

The reason for my mistaking your understanding of Witnesses is that your comments suggest that lack.  

For instance, your comments regarding Witness views on blood transfusions suggests an accentuated concern with the medical benefits.  As one who was a Witness, you would understand that a Witness individually chooses to reject blood, in all its many forms, due to a deep respect for Jehovah's view of blood, being sacred, as well as obedience to the direct commands to abstain.   Even if this means one's risk of dying.  Medical benefits are accompanying benefits, not the reason.  However, medical benefits and the present move away from blood by most medical professionals and science underscores the recurring pattern found in the Bible that obedience to God is always beneficial.  

Additionally, your views on the military and the positions of Jehovah's Witnesses shows a lack of understanding.  You refer to Matthew 8:5-13.",1,-0.03842824414178436,0.03842824414178436

893,"Their Northward expansion from Homer this fall is about to run into conditions which are not so welcome, as the forest on the Kenai transitions from Sitka to Lutz(a hybrid of white and sitka) spruce between Anchor Point and Ninilchik.  We've never seen them feed on Lutz or white spruce outside of the laboratory, so it is possible that the combination of the different tree species, as well as the relatively warmer and drier conditions could combine to stop them.  

One of the interesting things I have noticed about the infestation in Homer was the sheer number of insects.  a ""severe"" outbreak in the literature from their home range in Europe is 17-20 aphids per 100 needles.

3526,"I recall George Brown repeatedly asking the city manager to give the Council a list of possible Opportunity Village sites a few years ago, and the manager not providing it. He has removed benches from downtown without any explicit directive from the Council. The mayor said that police took it upon themselves to remove tables and chairs from Keysey Square. The police chief is controlled by the city manager. Ruiz also closed Whoville without providing any alternative shelter, which the Council had directed him to do before shutting it down.

Eugene's council-manager system of government just doesn't work. City councilors have too little power over what the city manager does, which in some cases allows them to duck responsibility. Portland has a different system where the councilors are responsible for running city departments, and the buck stops there. It may not be as ""professional"", but it's more accountable. We should consider changing our system.",1,-0.0020850920750656865,0.0020850920750656865
2743,"As a far left person myself I would like to ask one question, did the counter-protesters (the so-called left though I would not classify them as left) have weapons (ex. sticks, pipes, guns); if so Trump was right.  You don't meet violence with violence, you let the far right exhibit the behaviours they are known for, such as intolerance, stupidity  and hatred.   That is enough to have them relegated to the fringe where they belong.  However, the msm as usual makes little to no effort to overcome their tendency to speak only in politically correct terms instead of delving into the issues.  Corporate think.   
Problem with terming too many people as left is that it renders the word meaningless.  Feminists are not left; BLM is not left; etc. 
Also, I have no issue with dismantling these statues of these barbaric men, but again Trump is right, why not Washington (largest land owner at the time and slave owner) and Lincoln (big time slave owner)?   The mushy middle can only handle so much?",0,0.001857601998142444,0.001857601998142444
