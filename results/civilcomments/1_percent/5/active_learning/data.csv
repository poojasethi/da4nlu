The ""coveting"" of the things around us, as mentioned in another commandment, is a tremendous incentive for many people to better themselves.

Your comments and responses exhibit a lack of understanding of the beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses.  They further exhibit a lack of effort to understand what they believe.  When one does not try to understand the other person, notwithstanding maintaining disagreement, there is no meaningful point to criticizing those views.  

You have spent considerable time and effort to disparage views that you do not want to understand.  This seems to be a pointless pursuit.   

Jehovah's Witnesses, at least those who practice this faith, believe themselves to be ""honest hearted"" ones as defined in the Bible.  Those who see the world to be not as they would expect it's creator to have made it. Those who are ""sighing and groaning over the detestable things"" they see around them, not accepting and not believing men have the power to correct the problems.  Those who do not see themselves as the center of the universe but rather believe there to be a creator worth searching for.",0,-0.11772963290432381,0.11772963290432381

Too many people do not see the difference between a legal Latino resident and those that are here illegally. In fact these two groups really do not intermingle. Part of that is due to the fact that many native born Latinos are the first to be affected by the lower wages brought about by a large population of people who will work for less  Its one reason why Trump picked up almost 1/3 of the Latino vote.
