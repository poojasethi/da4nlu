I believe Pope Francis wants us to focus on Jesus more than on man-made institutional Church doctrines. Pope Francis is asking us to be discerning, to read the Gospels, and to be open to the gift of grace and to a personal relationship with Jesus, rather than focusing on the Catechism, in my view.

Neither the national or state governments were truly self-governing. Both derived their authority from the consent of the governed.

These thoughts from a spiritual master are a profound challenge for anyone progressive today.

Francis transformed these Rules into a progressive manifesto by saying, no one should have a problem with the gist of these rules provided you understand the Church in V2 terms--God's holy people, not the magisteriuim.  With that simple observation, the focus for finding the Spirit becomes What is happening among the entire Church, including all of the faithful, that matters. It does seem pretty obvious that Francis' Church and the magisterium are not at all pointed in the same direction. 

That is the deeper Francis, IMHO; but given his position and the need to hold this fractious people together, he has to push for open discussion rather than led in the direction he may prefer.

Danny, I find it very strange that church records don't show anyone other than EGW as having the gift of Prophecy. And besides, the writings of anyone who believes in Christ can be inspiring; and afterwards regarded by others as God-inspired. So where does that leave all the believers today in regards to the gift of prophecy and inspired writings, or rather, are believers less gifted than she was? I don't think so. Believing we are less gifted would be denying the indwelling Spirit of God.

However I frequently have little or no idea of what he says. i can hear bits and pieces as his voice rises and falls, as he speaks distinctly at times, rushes his words and becomes unintelligible, not inaudible, at other times. I can hear sound but not distinct words. It is painful to sit and listen for fifteen minutes and be unable to follow what is said. 
Perhaps we need to teach priests to speak clearly and distinctly!! Of course the problem is exacerbated when the priest is not fluent in English! But the problem exists with all of them.

In a simplified analysis, there exist three classes of schools:
1. Totally state-operated schools.
2. Partially state-operated schools (probably the majority, and particularly including the ""former model-C"" schools)
3. Totally private schools.
Of those, the first two classes report, in non-academic activities, wholly or partially to government, and can be regulated in terms of their religious policies.  
The third class are only regulated in terms of their academic curriculum being directed towards the same matric examinations, but otherwise they are free to set their own rules, particularly in religious matters.  In that way, there are some church-operated Christian schools, some Moslem schools, and some operated by the Jewish community.  All of these will show strong religious preferences.

The liturgy is the organizing element that allows us to love God and receive the gifts of his sacraments, so that we can learn to love our neighbor in our daily lives.  But of course, if you believe in the primacy of conscience over Scripture (the word of God) and Tradition (accumulated wisdom) then you will naturally prefer to worship God in your own way and on your own terms.

2963,"Immigration, like so many issues is complex, but applying the past to the current situation is just selectively blind optimism. 
In the past, most immigrants came with the intent to make a better life - & to make that possible- to learn the language, to blend in with the American culture.  Massive illegal drug importation & illegal entry were not significant factors. Terrorism was not a big issue, back then.
 Things are very different now & new parameters must be employed. In the past there were no large bureaucracies anxious to add to new clients to the welfare roles. In fact immigrants -like citizens - had to fend for themselves.
When I drove to Alaska from the 'lower 48' in 1967, I had to show sufficient cash to pass through Canada - as a means of minimizing risk that I would become a burden to Canada before I could get through the country.

Our healthcare system has been a mess for decades.  It's gotten worse with each new government program passed, pretty much since 1965.  We need to get government further OUT of healthcare, but instead all we've been doing is getting government deeper and deeper into it, screwing it up worse each time.

Premiums alone - bad as they've been - are only part of the story with Obamacare.  Deductables have soared even more.  And perhaps most costly of all is the massive Medicaid expansion.  Shifting costs to taxpayers is not fixing the system.  I'd argue that's even worse.",0,-2.1530606433351878,2.1530606433351878

2507,"Perhaps the PTB should think  beyond rote words and ritualized movementss to how to build genuine communities of people who want to support one another in their efforts to live as  Jesus taught.  This could mean eliminating large parish churches (some approaching megachurch size in the suburbs) in favor of the house churches you  mentioned.  Each parish could be subdivided into small groups who would meet in one another's homes to share bread and wine. The presider would be the head of household or someone chosen by the group, as was done in the early church before priests wrested away control of the eucharistic meal.  The decline in numbers of priests for that last 40 years seems to be a sign that it's time for change, if the church is to continue. Few Catholic parishes are real communities.  Parish churches could serve for special celebratory liturgies for the community, and the priest/staff would serve as the central place needed to organize the community into the house churches,",0,-2.1404805072670308,2.1404805072670308

Quite true, pace, and as Oxford historians, Alister McGrath and Diarmild McCulloch have both pointed out, the ""middle way,"" which developed in England in the late sixteenth century, was between Lutheranism and Calvinism -- two distinct versions of Protestantism. And that ""middle way, which resulted [in Anglicanism], was neither Calvinist nor Lutheran -- but it was certainly Protestant,"" McGrath notes.

In the Catholic Church, merit is not a function of office., office is a function of merit.  In other words--a bishop's consecration and ordination is what qualifies them to be the teacher of the Faith, not their academic credentials.

The whole problem with dissenting theologians is precisely that they do not understand their proper role.  The role of the theologian is to show how what the Church teaches is contained in the sources of revelation.
