26,"Well, despite living in Alaska in that time frame, I don't recall an incident resembling this.  I would hope that it is not true as you describe.  Not that I advocate or defend making racist comments, but doing so isn't a crime.",1,15.638061132235343,15.638061132235343
7,"When my first grandchild died, a Jewish couple sat shiva with my wife and me. They wept with us, to show their concern. This was not emotionalism, this was being fellow mourners. And being true friends.",0,-15.533053701923759,15.533053701923759
25,"Does Renzetti really get paid for this?   Weinstein is of Hollywood and one of the exceptions in this ugly sexist world, but to generally imply that females everywhere need to be alert to excessive male behaviour everywhere is absurd.   How do the sexes mix and mate, as nature invites and requires, if males are universally presented as sexist, aggressive, dominating beings ?",1,-0.08400752050230142,0.08400752050230142
11,"The posters using their talking points gleaned from their men's rights groups are ignoring the crux of the issue. The issue is not one of ""men work longer hours and more dangerous jobs"" or that ""men and women in the same role earn the same amount"", it is an issue that on the whole, men make more total dollars more than women.  Whatever the reasons are, it is high time they were addressed; be it encouragement for women to pursue higher education and advanced degrees, women being promoted as often as men, women being able to balance their home life and work life by being offered the support of our government to ease care-taker roles etc.

The most important point is that aside from in their minds, men are not injured by these conversations and viewpoints. They should be a part of them, but more on the listening side, and much, much less on the talking/reacting side.",0,0.07759532617921394,0.07759532617921394
