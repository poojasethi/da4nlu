20,"Except most of the Bible was not written in Hebrew or Aramaic, but in Greek, which Jesus (as far as I know) did not speak.  Let's make Liturgy understandable.  If the meaning is there, why get stuck on a literal translation?  I have not adopted ""with your spirit"" because it means nothing to me, and I'm sure my Creed would get me excommunicated if a priest heard me when I say it.",0,-24.11403026405343,24.11403026405343

12,"Again - your biased opinion.  You would flunk a basic Theology 101 course in Theological Anthropology.
We were created good with human freedom.  How do we explain this reality?  Scriptures are the reflections of a faith community that knows good people make bad choices - thus, good people must struggle.  
My point - you focus only on one part of the faith story; you emphasize one side (not unlike the Jansenist which your comments appear to reflect).
Theology and our faith journey is best when it is *both/and* rather than either/or.
