17,"My Father was in the WW2 with some Indians friends (I try not to use the I word anymore). Our family leased
land on their reserve and built a cottage. Our parents are gone but we're still there. We have a few years left on a 50 year lease which we a trying to extend. We leased the land off an individual not the band. We have always 
been treated fairly.


 I find most of the comments here, either outright racist or with a hidden racist undertone. Most of the commenters  only see the radical element, not the underlying quality and warmth of the people.
I find that Native people are like a huge family united in a mutual struggle; Grievances are a by-product.
Although there are two groups on the reserve: Native and Non-Native; there is a lot less racism than you would
assume. On this reserve many Non-Natives are family members. 


The most racist people I have encountered on this reserve  were visitors who abused the hospitality they were so graciously given.",0,0.9069491331299968,0.9069491331299968
