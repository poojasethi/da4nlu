0,"Cowardly Comey, who was doing nothing more than any other criminal before a judge trying to cover his assets and seek understanding for a crime committed, in an astonishing statement before the United States Senate committee, admitted he leaked information. His leaking information is a felony. Comey manifests a disrespect for the rule of law. That's bad for all of us. The man is a fraud, he's a disgrace to the FBI, and he should be charged with leaking information as would any other citizen of the United States. Did Comey have the courage to recommend charges against Hillary Clinton? Of course not. He's a coward.",1,19.30666320586928,19.30666320586928
12,"Again - your biased opinion.  You would flunk a basic Theology 101 course in Theological Anthropology.
We were created good with human freedom.  How do we explain this reality?  Scriptures are the reflections of a faith community that knows good people make bad choices - thus, good people must struggle.  
My point - you focus only on one part of the faith story; you emphasize one side (not unlike the Jansenist which your comments appear to reflect).
Theology and our faith journey is best when it is *both/and* rather than either/or.
