40,"Why do you think this country was born on God, Glory and Guts?  Why do people think this country was founded on Christian principles?  Why ""Shame on you!""  I don't think it is appropriate for anyone to pray to anything other than our Christian Biblical God, but I don't think it is necessary or even desirable to have invocation before any meeting of a business nature unless it is religious in nature.  I am somewhat confused by your stance about the 501c3 status.  I appreciate your viewpoint and dialog with me.  I value any discussion about the Christian faith.

also, A couple that knowingly ""configures"" itself to take advantage of ALL of its capabilities is doing God's work.

And those who block people from configuring themselves for God is guilty of blocking God.",0,-23.271562291963207,23.271562291963207
