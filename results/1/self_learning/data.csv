38,"You know, I would have been really happy if the Church said it was ok for a new gal to join me in the bedroom every night over the last 20 years, whether my wife liked it or not.  Spiritually, I'm not so sure how I'd see that as a good thing, even if the Church said it was ok.  My marriage has its ups and downs, as all do, but my wife and I made a commitment to love one another.  Some of the most fulfilling moments in my marriage have been when my wife and I have resolved a seemingly ""irreconcilable"" difference.  

Christ commanded us to love one another, so I don't quite get this notion of ""loveless marriage.""  Well, actually, I do: it's a misconception of what love is.  It's funny, because it seems that modern notions of love are formed from tv/film/book portrayals, whereas real love is exhibited by moms and dads.  Which is another reason why both parents in a loving marriage are really important for children's lives.",0,-18.308197881080943,18.308197881080943
34,"I knew if I read down far enough I would see Raymond Burke's name, and something linking him to the Correction -- even if it is to say Burke had not (yet) signed the document.
I always enjoy NCR, but I repeat what I have said before -- that whenever there's not enough news, NCR will find something that arouses the anti-Burke readership.  
Luther, of course, wrote one of the earliest Correction-type documents -- those 95 Theses that he nailed to the church door -- and it is ironic that Burke and his followers see themselves on the side of the popes against whom the Reformers protested!",0,-17.462808227753918,17.462808227753918

Within 10 years, an electrician, plumber, car repairs, all will cost more than a lawyer and doctor because nobody wants to work for their wages or learn a trade anymore. 3% of our high school students go to trade school. 3 people cannot fix what 97 break and wear out.",0,-12.558905152719117,12.558905152719117

1,The First See is judged by no one.  And Ray Burke is apparently under investigation along with the Knights of Malta for trying to get rid of one of the leading Knights without a fair hearing.  So what comes around I guess.  I suspect that since Pope Francis has given Burke many opportunities to get his act together and learn to keep his mouth shut that he may have to do something more drastic.,0,-11.254868584637016,11.254868584637016

33,Keep Hoffman in the rotation a long as he is pitching as well as the other day for sure. 9 strikeouts vs 0 walks is more than welcome in anybody's rotation. The only thing Anderson has going for him really is he is a left hander so there should be a spot in the pen for him. Marquez is likely the odd man out when Gray comes back but John better be ready to pitch or he may find himself in the rotation discussiom.,0,-9.670506667125526,9.670506667125526
17,"""that freed blacks owned more slaves than whites before the Civil War;""
I believe the argument is that proportionally freed blacks owned more slaves.  A very small minority of southern whites owned slaves and freed blacks were a much smaller minority of the population than that. So in absolute terms whites owned more slaves but in terms of relative numbers freed blacks were more slave owning than the majority whites.  I doubt Mr. Wilson made this distinction but would rather misrepresent the facts to support his Frankfurt School Marxist/Racist perspective.

It is also interesting to note that the first slave owner in the colonies was a black man. Sorry Marxists, your whites are evil narrative is not true and fundamentally racist.",0,-9.623630422959769,9.623630422959769

   skin color or racial identity is irrelevant as to whether someone is qualified to do a job - president -school superintendent - principal.   if the woman is incompetent, which is how it sounds, she doesn't belong in that position.  the teachers, students and parents deserve good, capable leadership.  we read of a couple of ""complaints"" without knowing how long the session lasted, but 80 people showed up on a lovely spring evening because they felt this strongly.  that speaks in itself.",0,-9.149120546872975,9.149120546872975
