11,"Doubling the basic tax exemption, massive reduction in corporate tax, easy tax on repatriated offshore income .. the only thing they could've done better was impose a flat 15% tax, across the board, end of story. If you've ever filed US tax returns (yes, I have) you'll understand the byzantine maze they have down there.

This will be good for the USA and a good US economy will be good for Canada, notwithstanding trade disputes. However, look for a $CDN below $0.70 very soon as capital continues to leave Canada under the inept state-interventionist Trudeau regime. American free enterprise is a fire breathing beast, if it is unchained.

32,"Strada,

""Working Alaska"" is the term used by out of state workers who work here and spend elsewhere.  One out of every five workers in Alaska is a non-resident.  In our four main industries, Mining, Commercial Fishing, Tourism and the Oil & Gas industry, the combined total of non-resident workers outnumber resident workers. 

Those ""non-Alaskans"" should contribute something to Alaska which a state income tax would address. Of course, we need to quit rewarding companies with state incentives and services for hiring non-residents and actually provide jobs to all those Alaskans that are unemployed.  You know, with the second highest unemployment percentage in the nation?

By the way, you can substitute Pete Kelly, Right Wingers and State Senate Majority for who will be responsible for shutting down state services, just so they can continue to pay out lavish subsidies to the Oil and Gas industry at the cost of education and state services in Alaska.",0,-11.92310574043752,11.92310574043752

Perhaps the Globe doesn't want too much discussion.

However, had they had a reporter at the meeting, they would have heard one councilor say the toll would not raise enough money to do more than fix the Gardiner and leave a tiny bit left over - not enough for transit. I think her first name is Pat. It's on the city hall meeting video for Dec. 13/16.",0,-11.309447995842037,11.309447995842037

21,"In spite of what this Catholic group states, the Bible also says in several places, those who do not work should not eat, this command is below:

2Th 3:9-11  It was not because we do not have that right, but to give you in ourselves an example to imitate.  (10)  For even when we were with you, we would give you this command: If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat.  

Psa 37:25  I have been young, and now am old, yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken or his children begging for bread.

And the verse they use is a poor motivation for helping the poor - So we are supposed to give in order to get ? I do realize there is a balance as some cannot provide for themselves and therefore must be provided for. Most homeless people I see are clearly taking advantage of others generosity, and it must stop. Catholic groups also emphasize giving and works as a way of entering into Heaven, Christ is the only a person can gain access to Heaven.",0,-9.847186467391698,9.847186467391698
38,"This area has been an issue since at least the early '90s. We used to know when someone is desperate and on crack. They would be ""under the bridge""!

43,"A dismissive and inane statement like ""White people thinking that because they helped a black child cross the road during apartheid, they stood up to the system, while waking up to an egg and bacon and white privilege for breakfast"" is the kind of inane, insulting and polarising attitude which makes the whole process of reconciliation and reconstruction so problematic. The writer would have us believe there was - and remains -  but one saint amidst the (white) Afrikaner devils and if he is correct in that deeply racist assumption then I fear our troubles will never end.

Of course, even in Germany and Sweden, their physicians and other health care professionals make as much as half what ours do, so that minor problem will still need to be addressed for a single-payer system to function here.  That fact also has quite a bit to do about their lower 'per capita' expenditures for health care.",0,-8.381849637990657,8.381849637990657
