You told us to follow the magisterium, and then when Pope Francis started saying things you conservatives didn't like, you said you could ignore them. It was Marty E who told me that I should take Humanae Vitae as gospel, but Laudato Si' was just the pope's personal opinion.

I think that it would serve the bishops far better to encourage  them to accept the criticism and to use it for salutary change.",0,-13.26429881329475,13.26429881329475

23,"I'm not going to troll your comment. I am going to assume you are asking this question out of a sincere desire to know the answer. If you have already made up your mind then, just keep scrolling. Otherwise, here is my best attempt. Let's start with the common ground of the two sides of this argument, which is 13 year-olds shouldn't be pregnant. No one thinks that is a good idea. Agreed. Unfortunately, very young girls do become pregnant, under a variety of very sad circumstances. Even more devastating, is pregnancy can be the result of a non-consensual act. This is heartbreaking. Not every young woman has loving and supportive parents, this law protected those young women. Requiring a parent signature assumed too much about parents. That they cared, that they weren't abusive, that they were parenting and not just parents in name only. Let's face it, why is such a young girl in need of an abortion? If you can't  imagine the circumstances under which  this occurs, you are blessed.",0,-11.44143212130568,11.44143212130568
17,How about spending more money towards the hiring of doctors in Victoria for people who are productive but with health problems that need to be dealt with ?   Walk -in clinics are fine for those who not seriously ill and have minor ailments.  Sure I feel sorry for Opioid addicts but there is little to help them with if they don't have the will to get off these drugs in the first place.  We should support them only by getting off the drugs but not by staying addicted which is a total waste of time and money !,0,-10.975021281016264,10.975021281016264

I found his social skills very compassionate and considerate, these are the people I like to socialize with.

18,"The 'trials of a translator' are described right there in the Bible itself, by the author of Ben Sirach! (At least for the early Christians and Catholics who considered the Septuagint to be the 'inspired' Bible.)

What's written in one language (whether Hebrew or Greek or Latin -- or 'Parseltongue')
often can't be accurately translated into another language. As Son of Sirach points out, all of our translations actually differ considerably from the original.  That's just a fact of any translation process, and has to be expected.

Retiring poor is an option - the GIS makes the Canadian definition of 'poor' a relatively comfortable existence relative to virtually everyone in the world.
