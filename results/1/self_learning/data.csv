31,"There is a specific role each gender has in raising children.   Yes, it can be done and done well by one parent and/or by two or more people of the same gender, but their is a specific role for each of the two genders.  Each has a specific way of viewing the world and that is the reason God created them the way he did.  The male he created to give direction to the family.  Not to abuse or be dictator of the family, but a supporter of and guider of the family to God.   The female to be the one who encourages and helps guide.  Not to be abused or dominated or dictated to, but to be a helpful assistant.  The children to be the learners. Again they are not to be abused, dominated, or dictated to, but to be trained as understanding is granted.  Each has their own individual role.

37,"The obvious point, lost, ignored, even denied by many pseudo-traditionalists is that the liturgy is about ""God and human"".  It is all about perpetuating the Incarnation - becoming flesh - that renders God visible, humanly lovable by humanity as human.

Your assertion that a ""parallel magisterium has reared its head"" has reared its head is unsupported by the interview, the cardinal correctly states that nothing can contradict Tradition (or Scripture) upon which the entire teaching rests, nor has “Neo Lefebvrism” any currency in the discussion as, unlike Marcel Lefebvre, the cardinal has not rejected a teaching of the Church, has not consecrated successors without mandate, nor challenged the authority of the Pope.

No free expression, no gender equality, no free press, no freedom of association, they make Atwood's handmaid's tale seem like a cakewalk.  Your facetious response would be funny if not for the depressing regression of Europe's social fabric over the last 15 years, ""no-go"" zones where women not covering their heads are hissed at and Jewish elementary schools require protection from soldiers in full tactical gear.
