42,"Announcement in 2015 of need for Cathedral repairs...could not find a follow up report?


Part 1
As a result of engineering studies conducted by our consultants over the past nine months, we have identified various waterproofing and structural issues that need to be corrected, including excessive “sag” or deflection of the floor slabs. These design and construction-related issues are mostly confined to the Chancery building, parking garage and Event Center areas. The Cathedral of Christ the Light, which is a structurally separate building, the Cathedral mausoleum and the parish offices and meeting rooms are not impacted.",0,-15.350238799008245,15.350238799008245
39,"Unprecedented? Really? To what species is he referring? To top it off, this writer only draws comparisons from the 1900s. How utterly lazy.
This is a typical collapse due to government corruption and indebtedness - an event very well historically recorded and repeated.  Study the collapse of the City State of Mainz in 1411. Or the economic collapse of feudal Japan leading to a dark age of 600 years.  
The historical record of corrupt government collapsing its own society due to indebtedness and the subsequent penalization and acts of violence against its citizenry to pay for debt does exist. It's just that academics are at best lazy, or at worst, refuse to abandon their beloved  ideological model:  in this case yet another strong-armed implementation of the wretched ideology of Marx and Engels.",0,-15.327002466322586,15.327002466322586
21,The other sad truth is that the same is happening at high schools in Markham. Non Asian kids are not getting class choices but the oversees students seem to be well taken care of.  Resources pulled from good students to compensate for ESL. My kid is being undeserved to accommodate the ESL. Very upsetting. We are heart broken. Not sure what benefits a tax payer receives.

8,"As interest rates inevitably rise over the next few years, debt servicing costs will increase.  Large deficits now when Canada is not in recession are unsustainable and will lead to either future cutbacks (under the CPC) or major tax hikes (Liberal).  

Further, we already have a very progressive tax structure, and taxing the rich even more will result in capital outflows and few jobs created.  It doesn't help that Trudeau's definition of the rich are doctors that we depend on, or moderately successful contractors or entrepreneurs who worked hard and took risks.

Ignore the spin and try to read between the lines in this budget.  Trudeau's roadmap of tax, spend and borrow will hurt Canada's long term competitiveness and prosperity.",0,-14.270199607620334,14.270199607620334

The tax credits would help the people who already have some financial means, but are worthless to people who don't. The refunds constitute a yearly reimbursement, which is fine if you have enough money to cover the monthly premiums in the meantime.

In 2005 when i moved here the bus was $40 a month. 10 years later it is now $60 a month.  Still a fantastic bargain.

There are roughly 850,000 people on the island. That is over $7,000 per person.

a B for refugees as we accomplished that by taking mostly Christians, so hopefully we wont have the problems that Europe is having

22,"Mark - I think Pope Francis has a monumental job on his hands - changing the culture of the church to be open to new ways of thinking.  He cannot act like a corporate CEO - that is also not the culture he wants and neither do I.   I think he is looking for ways to introduce change and bring about change without tearing the Church apart.

I still have hope that he can find ways to make change possible.  One step is Amoris Laetitia, which introduced the idea that the laity can discern and make decisions about the state of their souls outside of the bounds of hard rules and the oversight of anointed ones.  I also take hope in the fact that he has appointed Cardinal O'Malley to the CDF; perhaps he will work on the ""legal difficulties"" that plague the CDF actually dealing with bishops who cover-up sex abuse.  

Do I think Francis really ""gets it"" about child sex abuse?  Not entirely.  But he is hugely better than the last two popes.",0,-11.269665838353657,11.269665838353657

15,"I wonder if we understand this correctly. One way to understand US debt to foreign states is as tribute that the US exacts from other countries in order to provide access to its markets, much like the old Chinese imperial system. No one seriously expects that these loans will ever be paid back. Japanese, Chinese and many other countries subsidize the US by buying its debt on terms very favourable to the US. The debt is a sign of US strength and not weakness. It will never be repaid.",0,-10.278325758215761,10.278325758215761
