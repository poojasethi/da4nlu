11,"Doubling the basic tax exemption, massive reduction in corporate tax, easy tax on repatriated offshore income .. the only thing they could've done better was impose a flat 15% tax, across the board, end of story. If you've ever filed US tax returns (yes, I have) you'll understand the byzantine maze they have down there.

This will be good for the USA and a good US economy will be good for Canada, notwithstanding trade disputes. However, look for a $CDN below $0.70 very soon as capital continues to leave Canada under the inept state-interventionist Trudeau regime. American free enterprise is a fire breathing beast, if it is unchained.

32,"Strada,

""Working Alaska"" is the term used by out of state workers who work here and spend elsewhere.  One out of every five workers in Alaska is a non-resident.  In our four main industries, Mining, Commercial Fishing, Tourism and the Oil & Gas industry, the combined total of non-resident workers outnumber resident workers. 

Those ""non-Alaskans"" should contribute something to Alaska which a state income tax would address. Of course, we need to quit rewarding companies with state incentives and services for hiring non-residents and actually provide jobs to all those Alaskans that are unemployed.  You know, with the second highest unemployment percentage in the nation?

By the way, you can substitute Pete Kelly, Right Wingers and State Senate Majority for who will be responsible for shutting down state services, just so they can continue to pay out lavish subsidies to the Oil and Gas industry at the cost of education and state services in Alaska.",0,-11.92310574043752,11.92310574043752

I cycle a lot, commuting to and from downtown Toronto in heavy traffic, and I just don't get this statement.  Cars are by far the biggest threat to me.  Why?  Because they weigh a couple of tons and are driven by distracted and/or aggressive idiots who don't seem to care if they squash me like a bug.
