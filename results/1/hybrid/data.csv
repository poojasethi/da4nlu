31,"There is a specific role each gender has in raising children.   Yes, it can be done and done well by one parent and/or by two or more people of the same gender, but their is a specific role for each of the two genders.  Each has a specific way of viewing the world and that is the reason God created them the way he did.  The male he created to give direction to the family.  Not to abuse or be dictator of the family, but a supporter of and guider of the family to God.   The female to be the one who encourages and helps guide.  Not to be abused or dominated or dictated to, but to be a helpful assistant.  The children to be the learners. Again they are not to be abused, dominated, or dictated to, but to be trained as understanding is granted.  Each has their own individual role.

37,"The obvious point, lost, ignored, even denied by many pseudo-traditionalists is that the liturgy is about ""God and human"".  It is all about perpetuating the Incarnation - becoming flesh - that renders God visible, humanly lovable by humanity as human. 
If its ""about God and not about man"", it is not even Old Testament, it would be ""non-human"" or more precisely ""inhuman"", therefore not ""liturgy"" at all, at all.",0,-14.226935102105454,14.226935102105454

Your assertion that a ""parallel magisterium has reared its head"" has reared its head is unsupported by the interview, the cardinal correctly states that nothing can contradict Tradition (or Scripture) upon which the entire teaching rests, nor has “Neo Lefebvrism” any currency in the discussion as, unlike Marcel Lefebvre, the cardinal has not rejected a teaching of the Church, has not consecrated successors without mandate, nor challenged the authority of the Pope.

40,"Here's a little point to ponder. Surveys over the past 2 decades have consistently shown that journalists are the least trusted profession - and doctors the most trusted.
But then how the hell is there still an antivax movement ? Why is it still killing kids ? Because it turns out - people trust scary media reports that say vaccines will kill their kids more than they trust their doctors. A lot more. In that case - the journalists were being, at best, unethical for continuing to publish stories long after the claim was fully debunked (and lets face it - science reporting in the media is generally atrocious to begin with) - yet millions upon millions of people trusted them more than they trusted their doctors.

The conclusion is that surveys about media trust are utterly useless - what people SAY they believe have no actual correlation with what they do (as the subscriptions also show).  It turns out they even trust 'media' with no facts or ethics at all. They believed pizzagate.",0,-0.7741843538864632,0.7741843538864632
