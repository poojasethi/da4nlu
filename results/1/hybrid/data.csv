38,"You know, I would have been really happy if the Church said it was ok for a new gal to join me in the bedroom every night over the last 20 years, whether my wife liked it or not.  Spiritually, I'm not so sure how I'd see that as a good thing, even if the Church said it was ok.  My marriage has its ups and downs, as all do, but my wife and I made a commitment to love one another.  Some of the most fulfilling moments in my marriage have been when my wife and I have resolved a seemingly ""irreconcilable"" difference.  

Christ commanded us to love one another, so I don't quite get this notion of ""loveless marriage.""  Well, actually, I do: it's a misconception of what love is.  It's funny, because it seems that modern notions of love are formed from tv/film/book portrayals, whereas real love is exhibited by moms and dads.  Which is another reason why both parents in a loving marriage are really important for children's lives.",0,-18.308197881080943,18.308197881080943
34,"I knew if I read down far enough I would see Raymond Burke's name, and something linking him to the Correction -- even if it is to say Burke had not (yet) signed the document.
I always enjoy NCR, but I repeat what I have said before -- that whenever there's not enough news, NCR will find something that arouses the anti-Burke readership.  
Luther, of course, wrote one of the earliest Correction-type documents -- those 95 Theses that he nailed to the church door -- and it is ironic that Burke and his followers see themselves on the side of the popes against whom the Reformers protested!",0,-17.462808227753918,17.462808227753918

25,"I hate to break it to this reporter, but every blue collar industry is in the same boat, and everyone will pay for it. Within 10 years, an electrician, plumber, car repairs, all will cost more than a lawyer and doctor because nobody wants to work for their wages or learn a trade anymore. 3% of our high school students go to trade school. 3 people cannot fix what 97 break and wear out.",0,-12.558905152719117,12.558905152719117

1,The First See is judged by no one.  And Ray Burke is apparently under investigation along with the Knights of Malta for trying to get rid of one of the leading Knights without a fair hearing.  So what comes around I guess.  I suspect that since Pope Francis has given Burke many opportunities to get his act together and learn to keep his mouth shut that he may have to do something more drastic.,0,-11.254868584637016,11.254868584637016

If you don't think white racism doesn't effect public policy, please tell us when white racism stopped effecting public policy? It must have happened some time after 1965, but I missed it. Maybe Trump voters can help you. They don't think they are racists, they think they are just right about being better than black and brown people.",1,-4.805721295433232,4.805721295433232
13,"This article makes two things very clear: a)Donald Junior is a liar and b) not a very good one.  He keeps ""correcting"" his account as his version is shown to be untrue..he's at the point of a correction of a correction of a correction...who knows how far he's going to have to go.
Actually, I see the fact that he's such an unaccomplished liar as a good thing.  IMO, it indicates that he still has a shread of integrity and is uncomfortable with telling lies.  In this way he's SO different from his Dad.  As I've followed the saga of Donald Trump, read accounts of his early business and personal life, watched videos of his actions, as I've followed his campaign and his behaviors since being elected, one thing stands out.  Never once...thats NEVER ONCE, to my knowledge, has he corrected a mis-statement or admitted to a lie.  It makes no difference how trivial or how important the topic.  he is absolutely incapable of ""fessing up"" to his lies.  That is truly amazing.   Gary Crum",1,-3.968273389673021,3.968273389673021

23,"This is the end result of decades of republican policy; old, wealthy, white guys scared of the rest of the world, and wishing to live in ""Leave it to Beaver"" land.  Tax breaks for the wealthy, marginalize the poor, eliminate anything that looks like a social program to help their fellow Americans, micro-manage women's reproductive rights, and hide under phony morales and bark from under the bed.  He attacks women, minorities of any kind, veterans, the disabled, anyone not ""his"" kind of American.  

But, he is the nominee, so there are those who will hold their noses and try to support this vile, arrogant, conman.  

Go ahead; try to defend this indefensible monster.  Tell me how proud of him you are.  
Or, as is almost always the case, change the subject and tell me how bad Clinton, or Obama, or anyone else is - because you can't come up with anything meaningful.
