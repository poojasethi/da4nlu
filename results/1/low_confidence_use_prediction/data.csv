""The special counsel who oversaw the investigation of the Valerie Plame Wilson CIA leak case, Patrick J. Fitzgerald, wrote in a letter to defense counsel in January 2006 that some e-mail in the offices of Bush and Cheney was not preserved through ""the normal archiving process"" in 2003.""

26,"Here's the thing. A lot of those people became addicted taking exactly what their doctors prescribed. They trusted their doctors.  The doctors were either ignorant, careless, or greedy. Many trusted the pharmas who encouraged them to prescribe the stuff, promising that it wasn't addictive. 

Once addicted to opioids the concept of personal choice and responsibility evaporates for many. If you don't understand that you haven't spent much time around addicts.",0,-8.560775693958824,8.560775693958824
27,"There are many other ways to protect the victims of abuse. Simply housing them in a facility (in almost like a half-way house) is NOT empowering them. Instead, it keeps them reminded that they are victims and now victims of a system where they are oppressed yet again. The reason that the other states do not have such shelters is already stated. For example, in a system where equal rights are sustained, why are women with children denied of such a service? Yes, because it would be too expensive to house women with children. That alone violates equal opportunity. There are services available to women who are victims of abuse. And we have a police and sheriff's deputies that can check on these victims regularly without having to have them isolated from the population. Police presence alone will help dissuade abusers from threatening or assaulting their victims. We have counselors that can do the job for far less than housing them for about two years. This project is not cost effective.",0,-7.914757432481644,7.914757432481644

44,"Mr. Yakabuski starts poorly with his ""return of the native"" theme - redolent of 1960s Canlit - and an unconscionable click-bait lynching metaphor; then wanders off into areas of fantasy and untruth.when he delivers:

""His only sin was showing too much enthusiasm for a native heritage he may or may not have exaggerated. .
[ Put inane connecting sentence here] He never sought special privileges that the state or individual band councils confer on First Nations members.""

Ah, but Boyden did - demonstrably - unless Yakabuski is opening the whole ""special privileges"" can-of-worms attendant to Indian Act status - ""special"" residential schools, of course, carefully set aside.

I have no illusion that this would not be the case, given Yakabuski's seeming lack of research or careful thought about the case; which highlights his innate ability to pontificate in the Globe and Mail without actually bothering to make an cogent argument.
