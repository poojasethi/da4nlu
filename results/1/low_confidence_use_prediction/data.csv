30,"Who's being ""spiteful""? The hypocrisy is galling, though not so flagrant as the case of Ted Williams playing the moral theologian on Fox News. There's a double standard in the Church--one for the clergy and rich conservatives and another for the rabble. Jesus of Nazareth above all beings would appreciate the irony.

31,"Despicable is the word for this comment. ""native mothers be it from being knocked up at 15 or booze or drugs or what have you. "". These were the same mothers who were raped and sexually abused by Christian clerics in residential schools, who lost the ability to be mothers because the link between traditional culture was broken. What these women had to endure was years of lateral violence and toxic stress. ""vikingjorg"" was your mother raped and sexually abused?

39,"I am afraid you are wrong. 

Only one president did not involve in any corruption scandal.    Not because S Koreans are particularly corrupt.  But because South Korea has the most sophisticated/Transparent democracy outside Europe and North America.

As a conservative Republican who is opposed to abortion and same sex marriage (my son is gay, but I disagree with his life style choices and behavior; I have a daughter who had an extra-marital affair, and I disagree with her choices and behavior, too!) and who votes 100% Republican, I agree that gays, lesbians, and adulterers should be welcomed into church, but their behaviors, which Mother Church refers to as sinful, should never be approved.

If you don't think white racism doesn't effect public policy, please tell us when white racism stopped effecting public policy? It must have happened some time after 1965, but I missed it.

13,"This article makes two things very clear: a)Donald Junior is a liar and b) not a very good one.  He keeps ""correcting"" his account as his version is shown to be untrue..he's at the point of a correction of a correction of a correction...who knows how far he's going to have to go.
Actually, I see the fact that he's such an unaccomplished liar as a good thing.  IMO, it indicates that he still has a shread of integrity and is uncomfortable with telling lies.  In this way he's SO different from his Dad.  As I've followed the saga of Donald Trump, read accounts of his early business and personal life, watched videos of his actions, as I've followed his campaign and his behaviors since being elected, one thing stands out.  Never once...thats NEVER ONCE, to my knowledge, has he corrected a mis-statement or admitted to a lie.  It makes no difference how trivial or how important the topic.  he is absolutely incapable of ""fessing up"" to his lies.  That is truly amazing.   Gary Crum",0,-3.968273389673021,3.968273389673021

23,"This is the end result of decades of republican policy; old, wealthy, white guys scared of the rest of the world, and wishing to live in ""Leave it to Beaver"" land.  Tax breaks for the wealthy, marginalize the poor, eliminate anything that looks like a social program to help their fellow Americans, micro-manage women's reproductive rights, and hide under phony morales and bark from under the bed.  He attacks women, minorities of any kind, veterans, the disabled, anyone not ""his"" kind of American.  

But, he is the nominee, so there are those who will hold their noses and try to support this vile, arrogant, conman.  

Go ahead; try to defend this indefensible monster.  Tell me how proud of him you are.  
Or, as is almost always the case, change the subject and tell me how bad Clinton, or Obama, or anyone else is - because you can't come up with anything meaningful.
