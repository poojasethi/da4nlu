4,"I suppose you must be a relative of Mr. Dunleavy, or a staffer, because if you didn't write your comment you would know that back in 1981 when the Republicans took majority control of our Legislature they significantly changed the Corporate Tax Law whereas before 1981 Alaska taxed oil and gas on their gross production and not on their net.  By significantly changing the Corporate Tax, oil and gas have been paying billions in less taxes for the past 35-years.  Don't believe me?  Read this UAA oil and gas research study.  Better yet, why don't you have Dunleavy read this relevant study:

42,"According to the Energy Information Agency of the US Government Coal accounts for almost 25% of greenhouse gases.  If NG was used instead, it would produce about half of that.  NG well leaks produce about 4% of greenhouse gases and can be controlled better to reduce that amount.  But, even without further intervention, the math does not support your assertion.  You might be confused because you cite a cultural publication instead of a scientific journal or a site operated by scientists as a source.  I have read the misinformation you quote about gas leaks as published by activist groups trying to block use of NG, for fear that it would succeed in reducing greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, and might slow conversion to green energy.    NOAA and other science sources operate easy to read public information sites.  They do not editorialize.  The effects of global warming are noted and reported factually.  They are scary enough without exaggeration.",0,-6.399975382652496,6.399975382652496

40,"Here's a little point to ponder. Surveys over the past 2 decades have consistently shown that journalists are the least trusted profession - and doctors the most trusted.
But then how the hell is there still an antivax movement ? Why is it still killing kids ? Because it turns out - people trust scary media reports that say vaccines will kill their kids more than they trust their doctors. A lot more. In that case - the journalists were being, at best, unethical for continuing to publish stories long after the claim was fully debunked (and lets face it - science reporting in the media is generally atrocious to begin with) - yet millions upon millions of people trusted them more than they trusted their doctors.

The conclusion is that surveys about media trust are utterly useless - what people SAY they believe have no actual correlation with what they do (as the subscriptions also show).  It turns out they even trust 'media' with no facts or ethics at all. They believed pizzagate.",0,-0.7741843538864632,0.7741843538864632
