This book deals with Jackson. The book deals with a catering company, politics, faith, family, life, relationships, trust, and love.

The circumstances surrounding the two star-crossed lovers were a breath of fresh air from your normal romance novel. Even though Michael and Laine's story took place under unique circumstances, I feel that the reader can connect with them and what they went through. You could relate the struggles they dealt with to many different situations. I felt a real connection with the two main characters.

5473,"One foggy day, about three hours from Cape Cod, two women's cars collide on the road. Both appear to be running away from their marriages. April dies in the crash, while Isabelle survives, and is left not only to pick up the pieces of her life in the town she had wanted to escape, but becomes entangled with April's devastated husband, Charlie, and their young son, Sam, who is riddled with guilt about the accident. Charlie can't understand why April wanted to leave, and what she was doing on that road far from home, Sam wants nothing more than to talk to or see his mother one last time, and Isabelle is torn between again wanting to escape and wanting to stay to take care of Charlie and Sam, despite her role in their misery. And as their lives unfold, they realize the impact of every decision, and how sometimes the ""best"" decision isn't always the right one.

Pictures of You had moments of heartbreaking poignancy and moments when I wanted to shake each one of the characters into action, and both contributed to my enjoyment of the book. No character was drawn to be flawless; at times I sympathized with each of them, and at times I wished someone would just tell them to get a grip. The book definitely exceeded my expectations and surprised me in a number of ways, and that made me happy. And while I am, admittedly, a total sap, it was Caroline Leavitt's well-written story, combined with the emotional power it packs, that kept me reading this book well into the night in order to finish it.

Despite the looming piles of books to be read surrounding me when I woke up this morning, I picked this book up intending to read a few pages and then get some of things I had planned for today done. You know what they say about the best laid plans....

I'm hesitant to call this a ""cute read"" because I don't think it does the story, the characters nor the writing justice. I had assumed that this book would either be written in first person POV of Hadley, but it is actually written in third person, which makes it feel a little bit more ""grown-up"" - in a good way! I really liked Hadley as a character, and felt sympathetic towards her without feeling pity, enjoyed her sense of humor, her claustrophobia is something I can completely relate to and Oliver is funny and sweet in that most English of ways (am I a little biased as Mr Kat is English? Most probably.)

Ms. Smith's writing is excellent, delicately balancing the story with dialogue and story and moving at a quick but unrushed paced, with emphasis on character interactions, detailed but not over-the-top descriptions of people, places and situations and I was completely immersed.

I highly recommend this book, particularly to lovers of YA contemporary novels. It also has huge appeal for anyone who enjoys a good, sweet story.",4,"[-1.3050029251267836, -1.9890672855172582, -0.9101731175291267, -0.9994531724412387, -1.206934453201336]",-0.9101731175291267

Orla finds Millie intriguing and takes an interest in her. She decides to make Millie the heroine of her next novel. Unfortunately, Orla finds Millie's love life lacking and plans to help her spice it up with a cast of unique guys. What Orla doesn't know is that Millie already has her sights set on someone but he hates her guts. At least Millie won't be alone as she deals with being Orla's pet project, as she has Hester.

She was wrapped up in cling wrap and covered with mud, only to have the smoke detector go off, leaving her clothes less and still wrapped up when the firemen arrive.

Leo and Elaine, he most definitely claimed her.  Leo was a billionaire, who owned a tech company. Elaine was a young woman who took a summer job as an intern at Leos tech company. This story takes a few unexpected turns that I didn't expect. She was a Virgin. Big surprise since she seem so sexually attracted to Leo..  Leo was attracted at first site, he obviously used his interns for his sexual gratification. He saw Elaine as Submissive. She saw him as Dominant but didn't really know she liked that.  Initially I thought this was a sexual harassment case waiting to happen,  it that was not what happened at all. She goes out with him to a fund raiser, and wow, that scene was HOT.

2066,"When I first began reading THE OFFICERS' CLUB my impression was that this was a book written strictly for a male audience what with its military setting, salty language and sexual romps.  What I later discovered was an atmospheric novel (it's set in the late 1970's but the flavor and grit of the writing could easily have placed it in the 1940's) about the morality and immorality of the young military men and women stationed at Ft. Huachuca on the Arizona/Mexico border after Vietnam War.  What begins as a murder mystery with multiple potential suspects quickly turns into a compelling narrative and character study that takes a few chapters to really build it's momentum but soon immerses you in the personal drama of the inhabitants of this god forsaken piece of real estate whose lives seem to mirror the desert surroundings in which the live.  There's the blinding heat of passion, anger and guilt, there's a bleak tawdriness both in the landscape and in individual lives, and the predators that lurk at every turn are not confined to the desert.

Told in the first person by Lieutenant Roy Banks, a jazz loving intellectual with a giant ""zipper problem"" THE OFFICERS' CLUB contains a cast of characters you can love to hate, some more than others. Each has a personal history filled with secrets they're hiding from others as well as themselves. There are those who recognize the evil the perpetrated and are trying to atone in some small way while others seem to revel in their misdeeds.

THE OFFICERS'CLUB is a movie waiting to be made.  Think a director like Martin Scorsese's (The Departed) or the Coen Brother's (of Fargo and Blood Simple fame).  Then cast DiCaprio or Mark Wahlberg as Roy Banks, Jeffrey Donovan or maybe Scott Caan as Jerry, Jennifer Morrison as Marilyn, Patrick Wilson as Gene, newcomer Lana Parilla as the manipulative Jessie and perhaps Johnny Depp as Eli and your off to a good start.

9243,"This film's most memorable line comes early on, as a Wehrmacht captain played by Jrgen Prochnow examines the old structure he has been asked to occupy and comments ""the walls are thicker toward the middle, and thinner toward the outside. This place was not built to keep people out; it was built to hold something in.""

As most will know, this is the story of an ancient being in a Romanian ""keep"" that is unleashed by and feeds upon Nazis during the second world war. He teams with a Jewish scholar who has been freed from a concentration camp in order to help the Nazis defend themselves. The film is much more sophisticated than most films of this type in its attitude towards evil. It distinguishes between the professional soldiers of the Wehrmacht and the political officers of the SS, portraying the former as potentially noble compared to the latter. Even the monster within the keep behaves in an essentially admirable manner until the very end, killing only Nazis, defending a woman from rape, healing the sick Jewish scholar. He expresses outrage that Romanian villagers have been mistreated by the Nazis and vows to avenge them.

The film's greatest weakness, I think, is its pacing. It's impossible to tell how much time passes between scenes, though sometimes it seems to be weeks (they mention the need to retrieve the Jewish scholar from a concentration camp, and then in the next scene he has arrived in Romania). We never see the Nazis discussing what's happening to them or developing theories about the threat. Ian McKellen is healed and made decades younger and for the longest time nobody seems to notice or comment on it. Scott Glenn's behavior is similarly odd (though that can perhaps be forgiven as he is playing some sort of immortal being whose motivations may be beyond our understanding).",3,"[-2.158281891776329, -1.5258117357714687, -1.217749644615423, -1.023188837802412, -0.9122291237158794]",-0.9122291237158794
8064,"I blew through Capital Offense like a fast car on I-10 between El Paso and Junction. (No speed limit and no one interested in pulling you over anyway) You should probably read the first book, Last Call, before taking on Capital Offense just so you know who everyone is and what their roles are in relation to each other. This book had more of Bill Travis working alone than in a group and we saw more of Texas in a different light than the first book. I do love a Texas author who not only knows our state, but has actually spent some time on the roads traveling around the state and George Wier has evidently done that. Loved the idea of the Marfa lights being sort of a spiritual thing as opposed to some alien conspiracy!

As someone who has spent many years living in the deep West Texas deserts & mountains, I tend to cast a withering eye on writers who tell stories that involve the Marfa/Alpine/Fort Stockton areas. I can spot an author who has never been down there in just a few sentences and one who does their research via the internet alone is discovered and labeled ridiculous immediately. NOT the case with George Wier at all. His Bill Travis series is dead on accurate with regard to Texas and her highways, people and our peculiar behavior - and that is a very good thing!

Cash is able to weave the ghosts and their own part of the story seamlessly into the story of the living characters.  The utilization of ghostly interference as the creation of the angst in the relationship of Julie and Brad is very well done.  Cash is able to show in myriad fashion the ups and downs that every marriage could face in a way that is neither preachy or insulting.  You really feel for Julie and for Brad as they face the challenges both financial, emotional and supernatural.  The concept of buying an old run down place to flip and finding it haunted is brilliantly simple and plays well in a popular 21st real estate concept.  The ghost of Tessa and Gerald are as complex as the living.  I loved the book, I loved the ghosts and loved Julie and Brad.

This made him depressed, angry, abnoxious, sarcastic, bitter and very difficult to live with. He became a recluse. His concerned brother seeks help from their best friend in Pennsylvania, a psychologist who specializes in severe depression. Unable to leave his wife (with a complicated pregnancy problem), he sends his partner, Sara Hamilton instead. Having been through grief and humiliation herself when her husband left her for another woman right after they lost their baby, she dedicated her specialty in taking care of abused, battered and depressed women. She vowed to protect herself and to never get involved again in matters of the heart. She braced herself for a challenge as soon as they met. It was abysmal from the start but their relationship eventually took a different route ..both falling in love, she helped him break down his concrete wall of emotion and in turn, he helped her heal her broken heart. Before his eyesight returns, Sara decides to go home and return to her patients. And this is where the trouble begins. He doesn't know what she looks like. All he knows is her perfume scent and her voice. When he calls her home and a male voice answers (her visiting brother), he concludes that she had moved on. This is a poignant story that will pull your heartstrings in so many different ways. How they found each other again seven months later for a second chance in love.

Seven Days in May stars Kirk Douglas as Colonel Jiggs Casey. Colonel Jiggs Casey takes great pride and seriousness in his job. He even goes as far as to risk his own professional livelihood by telling President Jordan Lyman what he thinks is about to happen. This is serious because what Casey tells Lyman involves another supervisor General James Mattoon Scott (Burt Lancaster). This is significant because even in real-life telling a supervisor what you sense andor know can cause you great risk to your own job because there is no rule prohibiting them from telling another supervisor what you told them even with good intentions.

256,"Dan Crawford is stoked to be attending the summer college prep program at New Hampshire College. Even when he discovers that the dorm he'll be living in was once an insane asylum. Brookline is only a building, after all. Dan is intrigued by the place, though. He quickly befriends two fellow students, Abby and Jordan, and together they head out to explore. While the top levels have been given over to student housing, much of the lower levels is still out of bounds. Ignoring the restrictions, the three soon find their way to an office containing a number of eerie and intriguing images - pictures of old patients from the building's asylum days. Even more tempting, filing cabinets filled with patient information. But there's something strange going on in Brookline. A student is killed and Dan starts having problems with his memory. And then Dan and Abby discover something even more weird - something that connects them both to Brookline.

ASYLUM is outright fun! The inclusion of the ""vintage"" images does bring to mind Ransom Riggs's MISS PEREGRINE'S HOME FOR PECULIAR CHILDREN, though it is a bit difficult to tell how the imagery will stack up (the arc is missing a lot of the final images - I'll have to hit up the bookstore for a final copy tomorrow!).  Story wise, the two are different enough that there's really no need to compare.

Roux's tale is a creepy enough to be called horror and tense enough to be called thriller (I'd put it in the middle, thriller fans who may not be wholeheartedly horror fans are sure to enjoy just as much as a true horror fanatic will).

834,"With the focus on perpetually angry DS Alex Morrow, the working and criminal class neighborhoods of Mina's Glasgow provide the gritty atmosphere of this dark, but almost slapstick thriller.

The story opens as three fairly dim thugs botch a home invasion, Pat and Eddy going in screaming for a guy named Bob. Who is not among the three generations of Islamic Asians who live in the house. One of whom is a rebellious girl. ""Aleesha was a teenager and therefore interested in the world only as it spoke about her. She saw Pat like her, long for her to like him back, and despite her bewilderment and terror, his frank admiration warmed her.""

But things are not yet done going wrong. After an accidental shooting, the men grab the oldest and smallest of the household - the patriarch Aamir. Thrust into their van with a pillowcase over his head, ""Time began to melt."" He finds himself back in a world of terror, escaping from Uganda as a child with his mother.

Meanwhile the lead on the case has been given to the squad's male DS, Bannerman, a devious blockhead and her junior, but a smoother soul altogether. Morrow is furious, but then she's always furious. ""She knew her anger was disproportionate and scattered, leaking from her like water through a sock. It was being noticed, remarked upon in her assessments. It's nothing, she said, it's about nothing.""

The plot is a suspenseful procedural interwoven with scenes from the viewpoints of the hapless criminals and their captive, but as with all Mina's work, plot defers to character, which unfolds in tandem with the story. Even the perps, with their Three Stooges ineptitude, become real people before Mina is done with them.

1978,"Harris sets her tale in 1780 London and Oxfordshire, England, where the shocking death of young Lord Crick unleashes a barrage of gossip and innuendo. Writhing in agony as he breathes his last, Crick's unearthly screams leave the household reverberating with tension and suspicion, most of which falls on the young man's brother-in-law, Captain Michael Farrell, who will inherit the estate. Wracked with grief, Lady Lydia Farrell visits Dr. Thomas Silkstone, an anatomist from Philadelphia studying in London. At twenty-five, Silkstone is pioneering the field of forensic detection, the perfect candidate for Lady Lydia's request to have the cause of her brother's death determined- and whether her husband is implicated in the horrific event. Thus begins the systematic unraveling of a mystery that culminates in deadly conflicts and long-buried secrets.

While timing the pace of her novel to fit the era, the slow and precise evolution of the story is perhaps its biggest obstacle- one that is belied by an action-filled second half and an ample supply of devious characters and suspicious circumstances. Once the young anatomist is fully involved in the case- and more than a little enamored of the lovely Lady Lydia- the action accelerates until the final denouement. To be fair, Harris is grounding her tale in the history of anatomy and the scientific community, not to mention the reluctant embrace of new theories by an entrenched status quo. The protagonist is engaging, a blend of scientist and gentleman unskilled in the devious nature of his fellow humans, but certainly a quick study. It remains to be seen whether Harris will flesh out her forensic detective Dr. Thomas Silkstone in a projected series.

1613,"The story of Rosemary Kennedy was not unknown to me since I have been mentioning it to my psychology classes for years.  However, Larsons book provides details of the likely reasoning process that the father, Joe Kennedy, went through to determine to have his eldest daughter receive a lobotomy.  I say the likely process because it remains unknown from the family records how the Kennedy patriarch made his decision.

Current HIPAA laws protect the information on the procedure and the family papers do not make disclosures on this issue.  Therefore, while the author tried to provide as much documented information as possible, based on access to newly released family writings, she can only speculate on how and why the father made his decision.  It does seem clear, though, that he did so without fully consulting with his wife or his adult children.  In fact, the author notes that another of his daughters, Kick, obtained advice against the use of lobotomies.

What I had not before known was that the lobotomy used on Rosemary was not the so-called icepick method.  The infamous, Dr. Freeman, had not yet heard of this form of lobotomy and so he and his partner used more of a traditional surgical procedure of drilling through the side of the head.

The lobotomy is only a small part of this book and the author reserved it for nearly the last section of the book.  Instead, the book rightly focuses on the life and personality of Rosemary Kennedy.  Here, the author gives a portrait of an attractive woman with charm, although, one who was mentally damaged at birth due to poor medical attention.  This was in contrast to what she became after the procedure.

This was a sad story for the family and for fans of the family who would have certainly benefited from her presence if Rosemary neither had been harmed at birth nor had the lobotomy.  As noted in the concluding chapter, Eunice Kennedy established the Special Olympics in Rosemarys name that today assists many thousands of youth and adults.  Also, as president, John Kennedy established the Medical Training Act that worked to assist those with disabilities.  The Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore is one of the outstanding research institutes that assists thousands of children for a variety of difficult disorders including autism, fetal alcohol, etc.

2913,"To be honest,I had never heard of Michele Campbell and it was totally the title of this book that drew me in. The story begins with one of the women standing on the edge of a cliff. The author of It's Always the Husbandtakes readers back and forth in time beginning whenKate, Aubrey, and Jenny first met as college roommates at Carlisle College in Belle River, New Hampshire in the Whipple House dorm. They became inseparable despite being very different kinds of women. 

Kate was the wild, wealthy, beautiful but damaged outgoing girl. Aubrey came from a broken home, was on financial aid and wanted to put space between her past and herself. Then there was Jenny - very determined to succeed and very smart and ambitious. Somehow it worked for them and they swore they'd always be there for each other. They even became known as the Whipple Triplets.

When one of them dies under mysterious circumstances, will everyone assume, as is often the case, that its always the husband? The girls stood at the bridge that night - all there at the same time - but each of them leaves with a different idea of what actually took place. Despite that fact, they all have a solid bond of silence and secrecy about the events.

20 plus years later, all three women return toBelle River once again. Jenny is married and is now the mayor of Belle River. Aubrey is also married and owns property and a successful yoga business. Jenny is also married and now the mayor of Belle River. Kate is married to one of Carlisle's athletes who loves her dearly.

Now that they're ""all grown up"", they continue to cross paths but now they're not as close as they once were. Their self-interests cause them to make choices that change the course of their futures.

Michele Campbell writes a story full of curving twists and turns to keep you wondering what is going to happen next. The characters are complex, but very realistic. Truthfully, they don't give you the vibe that they are people you would necessarily want to hang out with if you met them in your life.

4867,"I've been thinking for days how I to write this review. I'm torn. I liked parts of the book and other parts I really didn't. I love a good angsty book but this was too much for me. I understand that there needs to be obstacles and hard times for a couple to overcome but I felt like what Aubrey was put through was too much. I think I was okay with what happened up to a certain point then I felt like the rest was maybe for shock value. I admire what Aubrey did with what she was handed but at the same time I am having a hard time believing she would keep so much of what she did from Dylan. I instantly loved Dylan, I'm all for the cocky a*shole, that owns what he is. From the very beginning he was smitten with Aubrey and I loved watching their relationship go from nothing to everything. The build up was great, I loved how she took the time for them to care about each other and learn to love themselves first. This is not an insta love kind of story and I think that is one of my favorite things about the story. I also had some issues with the way they were in the beginning, having a fifteen year old daughter myself, some of their conversations and things they did seemed to be what older kids do but maybe that's just the way things are away from where I live. I don't think it should be labeled as a stand alone, that's the other half of my reason for only giving 3 stars. So much is repeated from books one and two throughout I got bored and felt like I was wasting my time. If it was labeled to read the first two books then a lot of that repetitiveness could be eliminated and we could get more story of Dylan and Aubrey.

Finally, my wrists don't ache every time I make roasted vegetables! The pepper just comes raining out of this grinder. The crank on the top is just perfect -- smooth motion, pleasant sensations, and overall lovely to use.

The pepper looks like it's a little on the coarse side when you first start using it (even when you set it to ""fine"" on the little dial), but closer inspection just reveals that there's a LOT of pepper that gets ground up on every turn. It makes me wonder whether I'm cranking more than I need to because I'm used to using up so much more effort when I grind pepper! But honestly, one full rotation of the crank probably puts out a quarter teaspoon of ground pepper -- maybe a little less, but this baby really cranks out the pepper!

The only thing I'm nervous about is the mechanism for loading it with peppercorns. I'm worried that the little drawer will pop open and spill peppercorns everywhere. It hasn't happened, but I just don't feel secure with its fastening mechanism.

Still that should not be a hinder to enjoying this sequel to The Language of Bees. Mary Russell is as intriguing as her husband.

The novel begins at the cliff-hanger where its predecessor ended, with Mary and a precocious grandchild going in one direction while Holmes takes his injured son in another--both parties pursued by killers. Mary and the child are aided by an American pilot and the trio later team up with an eccentric forest dweller who proves to be more than expected.

Holmes and his newly-met son sail for Holland with a woman doctor who has been ""kidnapped"" to treat Damian Adler's bullet wound. The doctor is another plucky and admirable character.

Add to the mix the disappearance and presumed murder of Holmes' mysterious brother, Mycroft, and you have a truly engaging historical mystery.

548,"This book is a brilliant step-back overview of the state of our fisheries.  Although I felt like I was pretty knowledgeable on the subject, my eyes have been opened up to deeper level of complexity than I had ever considered. Especially on the economic and market driven side of the issue.

Perhaps, the best thing about this book is that it is not a pulpit the author uses to preach what you should or should not eat.  Nor does it ask that the reader guiltily end all fish eating.  What it is, is a contextual history of our relationship with seafood from the earliest day to the present where we find ourselves facing a lot of decisions regarding fishing and fish farming.

The narrative is centered on four fish that do a good job of capturing the story of fish and man.

  Salmon- probably our first food fish, and our first foray into global, industrial fish farming.

  European Sea Bass - our first complete victory in closing the circle on a marine fishes life cycle in captivity.  As the author says, a Rosetta Stone to unlocking the propogation for nearly all species

  Cod and Tuna - two examples that show that we are not doing the best to manage our fisheries, and how we may be misguided in our attempts to farm fish in general.

These four fish do a great job of illustrating how aquaculture has been driven by forces of economy, market, and tradition  more than logic, reason, or science.  These species has been chosen for domestication more for their pound for pound economic value rather than its compatibility to being farmed.

Using these four main characters, and a supporting cast of other species, the author demonstrates the failures, successes, and potential of human management of wild and domesticated stocks of fish.  That is another joy of this book, it is not a doom and gloom look at our future, it is a reasoned and hopeful view of what we can do.  And while it does not exactly spell out a plan, it does put forth a strong framework of how we can manage this resource and stop spending our principal, but live off the interest the ocean can return and the profits of intelligent aquaculture.

I'll never look at a fish on a plate the same again.",4,"[-2.4056541035648773, -2.023947649994082, -1.1614037062567837, -1.0296955497647522, -0.9213482190827252]",-0.9213482190827252

I have been waiting for Jillian's story for three novels now. She has been the reason and the driving forward behind what our killer has aimed for. It takes courage for her to come back and face the man who she believes to be after her life and the girl doesn't get much of a break!

It seemed with this title, there needed to be an explosion or death threat every couple of chapters to keep the tension level high. After a bit this pace became a bit old, but the romance leveled in was a nice balancing act.

 As I mentioned above, the end had a fantastic twist that I didn't see coming for three books. I think it was a surprise for our would-be murderer too. Talk about depravity...but it was interesting and different. Made for a ""did that really just happen??"" moment.

Contemporary suspense with a flair of romance and more than just a pinch of fast finger-flicking through the pages. A weekend read sure to keep you up late to find out ""who did it"".

 We live our entire lives thinking we know those closest to us.  But do we ever?

Relationships between mothers and daughters can sometimes be difficult.  For Annabel O'Conner and her mother Beatrice Buchanan, difficult is an understatement.  When Bea tells Anna that she is getting married and wants her to help with the planning, Anna sees this as an opportunity to get close to her mother.

Through the next few months, Anna continues helping Bea even though Bea's stubbornness causes Anna to just want to walk away many times.  As they spend more time together, Bea opens up about a lot of things she has kept hidden from everyone.  Maybe Bea isn't so bad after all.  When everything seems to be going wrong on the wedding day, there is a very good reason for it.  How will Anna react when she finds out what Bea's latest plan is?

This is a great book.  I really didn't want to like Bea at first.  But as I learned more about her, she really did have a big heart hidden under all of her snobbery.

2972,"Three novellas by Kelly Long from separate collections (An Amish Wedding, An Amish Christmas, and An Amish Love) are brought together in one book - with an absolutely lovely cover, perfect for the upcoming winter season, might I add! For those who love Amish stories with an extra dose of romance, Long is the author to know.

""A Perfect Secret,"" while certainly an intriguing story to begin with, is probably my least favorite of the three. It comes across as rather far-fetched with a strange premise. Luke's character is mysterious and charming, in a way, but I think if I were in Rose's position I'd be a bit put-off that my best friend and fiance wasn't who I thought he was - and, in fact, had a very different personality that he was only now displaying. But the subtle suspense and the ultimate emphasis on openness and trust in community serve as redeeming qualities.

""Christmas Cradles"" is the shortest of the three stories, and it's the ""quickness"" factor that made me a bit skeptical (the whole ""falling in love in one day"" sort of thing). Otherwise, this is just plain cute! The romance is sweet, the characters are endearing, and the whole story comes together in a symbolic, satisfying way. Very heart-warming!

""A Marriage of the Heart"" is probably my favorite of the three, romantically speaking. Abigail starts out as one of those characters that easily frustrates and annoys, but I loved reading about her growth in love for her new husband, as well as her father. This is a type of ""marriage of convenience"" story - although how it's seen as ""convenient"" for the different characters is certainly different! Joseph is a great hero, and this is a great, short love story! (Add some glasses to the man on the cover, and I personally pictured him and the woman next to him as Joseph and Abigail - although the setting on the cover is more reminiscent of ""Christmas Cradles."")

All in all, this collection is sweet, and these three stories added to my regard for Long's engaging writing style. If you're looking for some romantic, winter-afternoon reads, A Marriage of the Heart delivers.

4966,"This is one of my favorite plots in romance novels. Its such a clich, I know, but friendship would always be the best foundation of a relationship. Once, of course, the two friends are brave enough to cross the lines from being friends to lovers.

Cami and Jamie have been friends since they were kids and they have been inseparable ever since. They have tiptoed around their feelings for so long, and when they finally had the chance to finally explore their feelings and give it a chance  the unthinkable happened. It was a thing that you can only see in movies, you can hear in news and youd never think can happen to you or to the people close to you.

I think what I love about this novel more than just the romance is the ability of Camryn to withstand what happened to her  thanks to her friends, family and Jamie. They didn't desert her, they gave her what she needed, and stayed by her side until she allowed them in. Her courage, and bravery is very admirable. And Jamie never giving up on her is just as admirable as well.

The author was careful, she was sensitive in handling the topic that is quite a taboo to everyone. Most people would hush and never speak about it. She was brave enough to put it there, and make her readers realize it is happening, and that it was never the victims fault. That if we just support people like Cami, theyd realize it as well  and survive the ordeal.

And here I thought I was about to read another stereotypical bestfriends-turn-to-lovers romance novel, but I was wrong. This was something unexpected, something different, and something that will haunt you, crush you and will give you a sense of hope in the end.

9441,"Shane Acker's new film, coincidentally scheduled to release on 9/9/09, is in interesting bit of political fantasy.  Probably ever since the Machine was invented, man feared they would take over. In this case, the film's situation is the direct result of a philanthropic Scientist who created a Machine for the good of the State.  Unfortunately, it all went wrong.

9 awakens--not quite Machine and not quite Man, either, to find others of his kind.  He wants to learn as much as he can about the machines, but Wise Old 1 does everything he can to prevent the newest member of their troup from doing so. The eventual conflict and end is both heartwarming and disturbing.

Well worth the time if you like science fiction oddities.  May be too disturbing for your younger kids--under 7 or so.

most of my life.  They get into my shed and garage and occasionally into my house. Regular
snap traps work but no matter how many times I have used them it is uncomfortable picking a
trap with a dead mouse in it.  These traps offer a nice alternative but you do have to be willing to drive somewhere with a live mouse in the trap and release the mouse into the wild. If you are willing to do this these are nice traps.

I have never seem a catch system like this before.  The mouse runs through a small tunnel to the bait. The weight of the mouse causes the tunnel to life up causing the trap door to close.

These need to be checked on a regular basis. Once caught the mouse needs to be released away from your house or place of business.

I did catch one mouse with this trap. I went to some woods ten minutes from my house and released the mouse.

However, it has a smaller, softer, more personal feel to it, which I think made it a better book. We learn more about Mark Sava's past and the book sets up both personal and professional changes that we will, hopefully, see play out in future books.

Spy for Hire is a fast read. The story pulled me in immediately and carried me along. The main characters, Mark, Daria, and Decker are all likable, interesting, and appropriately heroic. The bad guys are a mixed bag; some are just bad, others seem to be doing, or at least enabling, bad things in service of doing good, which lends a little gray to the black and white picture.

The local cops have arrested young Tommy Braham for the killing of a local college student found in a lake, in what looks like a crime of passion. Tommy's confessed, but slits his own wrists in his cell, and Dr. Sara Linton, former county medical examiner who is in town to visit her family, suspects that there's more to this story than meets the eye. When Agent Trent arrives, he agrees with Dr. Linton, but the waters are muddied by Linton's grudge against the arresting officer, Detective Lena Adams, whom Linton holds responsible for the death of her husband, the former police chief. When the first victim's boyfriend is also found dead, in much the same manner, it becomes clear that Tommy Braham was indeed innocent. What follows are two tension filled days of grueling investigation, during which each of the major characters must confront his/her own weaknesses.

473,"This is the ultimate ""the philosophy of East versus West"" novel and although I was disturbed and, at times, resentful of the portrait of America and Americans as portrayed by the narrator of this tale, I was also enthralled and unable to stop reading.

The story is related in the form of a monologue between the chronicler, Changez, and an anonymous American stranger who he meets quite by chance in a caf&eacute; in Pakistan.  His tale commences as he leaves his homeland to pursue an education at Princeton (an opportunity few Americans can afford) and after graduation is hired by a prestigious New York company at a very generous starting salary.  He is at first enamored with the American lifestyle, but after 9/11 discovers a feeling of kinship with the perpetrators while becoming more and more critical of his host country.

Author Hamid uses his creation, Changez, to do a bit of finger wagging by having Changez espouses the belief that the U.S. ""interferes in the affairs of other countries"" while on the other he laments the U.S. r&eacute;sistance to ""interfere"" in the growing tensions between Pakistan and India. (reminiscent of a  teenager who comes to you for financial help but is annoyed when you attempt to provide some guidance to prevent a repeat of their financial woes and who, after accepting your cash, tells you to ""stop interfering in their lives"".)

Changez observation that America is ""giving itself over to dangerous nostalgia"" is replayed for the reader in his allegorical retelling of his relationship with Erica, an AmERICAn woman who he loves but who is so resistant to letting go of her memories of her deceased lover that she is unable to accept Changez (changes???) and is ultimately destroyed because of her obsessive love of the past.

 I will admit that Hamid is an extraordinary writer whose ability to draw you into the story and hold your attention is undeniable.  The subject matter being served in The Reluctant Fundamentalist, however, may not be a dish easily digested nor may it be suitable for every readers' palate.

966,"I was first introduced to Dan Chaon when I started getting interested in short stories in the late 1990s. I remember being blown away by several of his stories, and over the years I eagerly devoured both of his novels, You Remind Me of Me and Await Your Reply, which was one of my favorite books I read in 2009. Stay Awake is Chaon's return to short stories, and while I didn't feel that any of the stories in this collection packed the power of some of his older stories, they are still tremendously well-written and immensely readable.

All of the characters in these stories are dealing with some sort of trauma, be it physical, psychological, even paranormal. Some of my favorite stories included ""To Psychic Underworld:,"" in which a young widower starts finding cryptic notes on dollar bills, restaurant napkins, tacked to trees, etc.; ""Thinking of You in Your Time of Sorrow,"" which follows a high school couple whose lives are thrown into turmoil when their baby dies; ""Long Delayed, Always Expected,"" in which a woman has an interesting way of dealing with empty nest syndrome; and ""I Wake Up,"" which follows a young man who receives an out-of-the-blue phone call from his oldest sister, years after their family has been split into separate foster homes following their mother's horrible crime. Some of the stories work better than others; I tended to enjoy those that dealt with more regular situations than those which focused on the odd or paranormal.

Dan Chaon is a terrific writer, and his storytelling ability definitely shines in many of the stories in this collection.

Noel Holiday's life sucks. Trouble found her no matter what she did. Her most recent troubles were that she just lost her job, left her boyfriend when he proposed and she lost her apartment (because she lived with her boyfriend). All this just before Christmas! How can she tell her family that she screwed up again when she sees them at Christmas? She can't. So she invites Sam Stocking to spend Christmas with her family. The deal was that he had to pretend to be her boyfriend - the one she just broke up with. She didn't know him and had actually just met him in the airport bar while they were stranded, waiting for their flights home. Since he didn't have a family to celebrate with, he agreed to her plan. How hard could that be? He had no idea what he'd  signed up for.

Christmas is a very big deal for the Holiday family so the house is lit up like an airport. But that was just the beginning of Sam's Christmas adventure with Noel's crazy family. Her mom is worried about Noel getting married before she is too old, her dad is worried about her eggnog (you have to read it to understand), and her ancle is handsy to mention a few. Noel can't believe it when her boyfriend doesn't make a run for it every time one of her family does something insane. But Sam is a good sport and puts up with everything, even the lack of privacy. A closed bedroom door doesn't mean anything to this family.

This was a terrific story. I liked the meddlesome family who argued a lot but really loved each other. It has great characters, especially Sam. I loved the way he put up with all the insane things Noel's family did. But felt bad for him because of his sad childhood.

As always, Sara has written a fast paced rampage through Dis, New Eden and Northgate.  There were literally parts of this story where my jaw dropped.  If you've read it, you know what I mean.  If you haven't, well, I'm not going to spoil it for you.  But I think I took up talking to my kindle again.  It's OK - no one was watching.

And the ending?  Well, I'm not entirely sure that the term cliffhanger is sufficient to describe the position the author leaves us in.  Just.....evil. But... she's a best seller for a reason, and this book demonstrates why.

3953,"When single mom Chelsey Alton hears there is a job opening for a Municipal Clerk in Coral Beach, she quickly applies for the job. The council board members just as quickly vote to hire her, except for one, but the job is hers. Chelsey does have a few doubts about the job starting with the fact that the job is vacant because the previous Municipal Clerk is murdered. However, she puts that aside and delves into the job.

Chelsey learns there is an Administrative Assistant job opened as well after the previous assistant unceremoniously walked out. She recommends her friend Bonnie for the job and she gets hired too.

It doesnt take long before Chelsey realizes something strange is going on in the town of Coral Beach from mysterious fires, murders, angry residents, mobsters and nasty board members. Determined to stay out of it, she finds just the opposite happens and shes right in the middle of it.

What a great read this is! Each character was vividly portrayed. Chelsey is a strong heroine surrounded by a zany cast of characters. Her sidekick Bonnie keeps readers laughing. There are also stalkers, romantic interests and evil mobsters tossed into the mix. The story takes a million twists and turns and keeps you guessing to the end. I really enjoyed this well written mystery. Who knew being a Municipal Clerk could be so dangerous?

I haven't read the first book, Red Tape, but its on my Kindle and I will definitely be reading it. Although Tax Cut is the second book, I felt it stood on its own. I didn't feel lost as I read it, I jumped right in and Im glad I did.

From the beginning the book was beautifully written with a few rougher edges. In truth the plot is entirely centered around the romance and that is just how I like my historical-romances to be. There was nothing missing from this book based solely on the romance. In fact I couldn't take my eyes off of the novel for too long because I was too anxious to continue my reading.

My favorite part about the story (it was hard to choose) is that both Adam and Katherine had to convince one another that their relationship was woven around true love. Adam was torn, almost like a lost soul after the death of his first wife and Katherine had been burned before by the events of life. Both were certainly searching for something, only I don't think they were counting that in finding one another the answers were hidden in the embrace of their love.

I liked the idea behind the story, but most of it felt like it was about Henry, rather than Margot. I would have liked to know more about her life before it became what it was when we came into the story. If you enjoy the kind of book that will make you think later, even after you have finished it, this one would be a good choice.

Many things happen in the course of this story, and it makes you think about life choices and the way things happen to us. I respected that Margot was an emotionally strong character, but also that Henry had a soft side as well. These people were very real to me during reading this, and I didn't want to let them go at the end of the book.

Don't get me wrong it's romantic but at the same time less sexy and fittingly so in some respects, and I did like Mallory and Quinn as individuals and a couple. However, considering their pasts, everything was a bit too easy and agreeable, with the story feeling rushed, unfinished and failing to hold the emotion I know Force is capable of: something these characters deserved.

952,"This book bears distinct resemblance to Goodman's earlier Lake of Dead Languages. Both take place at elite private schools in the northeast. Both books' main characters are single mothers and teachers who move to these schools to teach under difficult circumstances. And both books rely heavily on student and faculty obsession with old myths. In Arcadia Falls the single mother in question is Meg Rosenthal, recently widowed folklore scholar, who moves herself and her daughter to a remote region of upstate New York to take a much-needed teaching job at the Arcadia School. The school began its life as a feminist artist colony, whose founders wrote and illustrated fairy tales. The school's founders, Vera Beecher and Lily Eberhart, are professional and romantic partners, but with the arrival of a charismatic sculptor at the colony, Lily finds herself in the midst of a troublesome love triangle. The consequences of this triangle will lead to Lily's death. It quickly becomes apparent to Meg that the Arcadia School is a dangerous and deadly place,not just in Lily's time, but in her own, too. The books is the retelling of three stories, that of Meg and Sally Rosenthal, that of Vera Beecher and Lily Eberhart, and the fairy tale, The Changeling Girl. Goodman does an excellent job of weaving these tales together. While the book does bear some similarities to some of Goodman's earlier work, it is not merely the same story retold. I was captivated with discovering who or what was responsible for Lily Eberhart's death. I did find that after the circumstances of Lily's death were revealed the book was neither as compelling, nor as plausible.

Gabriel and Nicolette's story was certainly an interesting one. Here, you've got the scene where Nicolette, being the daughter of some of the hired help in the de Vincent house, she basically grew up with the brothers. That's not to say they're all super close or ""like family"", but the connection and history are all there. It's also no secret that Nic had a major crush on Gabriel growing up and their shared history is a bit tricky itself. Anyways, Nic is back in their lives temporarily because her parents aren't as able to help within the house due to health concerns and the tension between her and Gabriel begins.

I will say that there's a lot more depth and drama with regards to Gabriel than I initially thought. He came off as pretty carefree and playful in the first book, so it was interesting to see what was beneath his facade. There were a lot of times that he played the douche card and I didn't appreciate that since I've grown fairly tired of that kind of guy (in any book, let alone a JLA book), but it is what it is. Nic held on strong though and I genuinely liked her. As with any JLA book, I enjoyed watching them fall in love nonetheless.

The overall storyline progresses a bit as well through this book and I just can't quite place my finger on the overall tone of this series. I both love and hate that. I want to know!

3066,"I don't believe that Hilary Clinton is a saint, but I don't think she's quite the devil that Klein portrays her as in this book.  For those who have read other anti-Hilary books, or who read the columns of many leading conservatives in the media, most of this will seem repetitive.  And I think there's still a good book - and a more balanced one - waiting to be written about Ms Clinton.

As with most of these books, your political viewpoint will undoubtedly affect your enjoyment of the book.  The left won't want to hear any of the valid criticisms, a fact that's already been proven by all the one-star reviews on here by people who probably haven't even read the dust jacket, much less the book itself.  If you lean towards the right, or if you're just a Hilary-hater in general, you'll likely enjoy reading about her supposed evil, scheming ways.

Klein's writing is good, even if some of what he writes seems unbelievable.  He tends to reach at times, but without that reaching this book wouldn't have generated such controversry.  This is just another average entry in a crowded field of books about political leaders, one not much better or worse than most of what is already out there.",2,"[-1.2821719521533643, -0.9359406235287192, -1.142829575450305, -0.9795439103358808, -1.1751110140142051]",-0.9359406235287192

The dog is named Lewis, and a family asks George to adopt Lewis for a year, while their son has a series of shots to end his allergic reaction to Lewis. Lewis is a special dog who people can not lie to so he brings out truth. The RV trip starts out as a rather serious venture but Lewis and George grow fond of each other and have lots of fun adventures. George helps out a young man by buying a motorcycle with a sidecar (which allows the young man to go back to college), and Lewis wears goggles and a helmet in the sidecar and makes friends everywhere and lifts George's spirits from depression to enjoying life again.

When Ian Cresswell, the nephew of the rich and prominent Bernard Fairclough, is found dead on the family estate, the victim of a drowning presumably, there is no reason to think the death is anything but an accident. But when Inspector Lynley of Scotland Yard is called in to investigate and secures the services of his good friends, Simon and Deborah St. James, to help him, their digging reveals all kinds of strange things. Bernard's son Nicholas, a recovering drug addict,and his beautiful wife, are among the prime suspects. But what of the victim's bitter ex-wife and the man her husband left her for? As the investigation continues and family secrets are revealed, everyone comes under suspicion, including Fairclough himself. The trouble is none of these people are very appealing characters and the only one I felt any empathy for was the victim's 14-year-old son, Tim, who was so hurt by his father's actions he wants to kill himself.

8728,"As a huge fan of this series, I was thrilled when Athica Lane was finally released. Ms. Brynne Asher once again did not disappoint. There were so many things to like about this romantic read I'm not sure where to begin. The best place to start would be with the Carpino family themselves. I love that we got to visit with them again. Especially loved Tony and Paige's dad's protective nature towards her.

Next, would be Paige, herself. Loved her sassiness & witty banter with everyone she came across. She seemed to have a Kristen Ashley Rock Chick vibe. Fans of those books know what I'm referring to. The scene where she stepped in to help Cam's kids definitely reinforced that notion. Loved how she rushed up to the three thugs to try to distract them even when 911 told her not to.

Cam, the alpha hero, was swoon worthy except for the two times he hurt Paige...emotionally, of course. That is another theme KA is known for. Along with the heroine a little too quick to forgive. At least, the second time he did suffer quite a bit more.

Definitely think Kristen Ashley fans will enjoy this one. Start with Overflow, my romance book-loving friends. Next, delve into Beautiful Life, then journey down Athica Lane. The Carpino family are patiently standing by just waiting to entertain you.

While visiting with his friend Nile, the couple find there is going to be a documentary filmed on location with Nile believing it will be good for publicity. This is where Madi gets hoodwinked into becoming a small part of the documentary, much to her chagrin.

Not to much realism but I did like both H/H Helena Bansbury the illegitimate daughter of the Duke of Wilkinson and Robert Dennington the Marquess of Westfield heir to his father the Duke Somerset. Both the H/H have had traumatic events take place in there lives especially Helena, she has scars on her face and hands to prove the physical abuse she suffer as a child. Roberts pain came at the hands of his grandfather who has sex with the women he was going to elope with. He was young and nave. This two meet in a gaming Hell owed by Helen's brothers. I liked most aspects of the story. It just took way to long for this couple to really come together and to overcome there personal misconceptions of people. I also, got tired of hearing how scared Helena was. I almost felt at times that Robert was falling in love with a tall, unattractive, scared Helena because she was safe and not the usual beautiful petite young women of the Ton. I am not quite sure I like this perspective. However, The Rogue's Wager is an excellent additions to the Sinful Bride series!! I do Recommend reading it if you like HR.

But, Greenglass House is the type of book that somehow makes those other books, good as they are, seem only good because this one is so great.

Greenglass House is the type of book that is well considered, well constructed, well thought out, and, well, intriguing while also being an accessible middle grade mystery for all age groups.  Those that can read it for themselves will be enraptured by the story of twelve year old Milo who quickly finds his quiet Christmas vacation is about to be anything but.  This book makes for a great read aloud story as well since everyone can relate to Milo's desire to fit in even amongst his adopted family and solve the mysteries behind why the inn in which he lives suddenly has a glut of residents during what is normally a very quiet time indeed.

Milford's ability to spin multiple yarns in the book makes it one hard to put down volume.  It is certainly one that begs for a late night.

He wants you to like him and believe he's a mensch, but a highly gifted and slightly eccentric mensch. He succeeded.

This is not a literary book.  It is a conversation, with all of the self-absorption along with more than a little self-deprecation that such introspections typically bring.  But, Feynman's work product continues to be a huge force in physics today and he worked with and knew many of those more publicly exposed scientists of the 20th Century. That makes the conversation worth listening to without the speaker picking up the bar tab. His science is wonderful.  His morality...not so much.

Reading the book, it is almost impossible not to draw comparisons between what Feynman was able to achieve under the conditions and tools available to him at that time, and the work of some of the leading public science advocates today.  Feynman doesn't lose in the comparison.

Lawrence Krauss recently wrote a biography on Feynman.

Modeling doesnt exactly feel like Adam (soon to be a celebrity named Axel) Jamess calling, but its a way to pay the bills and he has some serious ones mounting.  He endures a grueling interview process, but hes rewarded with a job and meeting the girl who might just be his perfect match.

Solo Cohan might be surrounded by hot guys 24/7 working as a PR pro for a modeling company, but she has her reason for not getting involved.  Shes quirky; hes down to earth. With plenty of shared interests, they are perfect for each other.

Adam does some major wooing to get Solo to give them a chance. Adam is totally adorable, a real swoon-worthy book boyfriend.  If you're looking for an alternative to the popular manwhore hero, then Adam certainly fits the bill.  He's a total sweetie, and for the record, he has quite the package that he refers to as ""Just-in Beaver."" ;-)

There's plenty of cute exchanges as well as sexy times. Ill admit that at one point I began to fear the story (and a particular character) was headed in a clichd route, but alas it wasn't and the person it had to do with turned out to be someone that now Id be interested in reading in their own story. Thats not to say there isn't misunderstandings that, with a little more maturity, Solo and Adam could have easily avoided. But overall its a cute and sexy story.

Julie Richardson from CDC, BTR (Biological Threat Research), is interviewing Ben in the cafeteria when excited personnel rush in with a sick man. Julie and Ben leave by the back door and head to her truck. Julie knows the sick man could be contagious. Shes right.

Introverted Ben and extroverted Julie make for an unusual team. I really liked the way they played off each other. Glimpses into Bens past explain why he is the way he is. When the chips are down he comes through.

This is one thrilling book. The back stories that give insight into the origin of the virus are right on. Its not hard to believe Russian explorers were here in the early days or that their remains were found by students and taken by a big Drug Corp. I already knew that Yellowstone was a volcano. Ive been there and seen it. Not hard to imagine what would happen if a bomb really did explode there.
The tension builds throughout the story until the very end and it is an adrenaline rush. I want more of Ben, but it will be hard to come up with something to beat this novel for suspense, action, and thrills.

Mike Vendetti is the narrator and he did a splendid job of it. His reading was clear and concise, very well done. I could listen to him for hours, in fact I did. Production was perfect. No jumps, skips, or static. A perfect rendition.
The book cover was colorful and well done. Symbolic.

So here he finds himself, living back home, divorced and now that he admits it, more than fifty pounds overweight. Addicted to cheese puffs and food in general, he decides he needs to make some changes. When Lindy, the art teacher at Blue Ridge High, approaches him to leave a poster on the library's bulletin board about a supper club for overweight individuals, he decides this may be the way to start. Soon, the five members meet and decide to call themselves the Flab Five. In addition to Lindy and James, they are Gillian, part vegetarian and manager of the Yuppy Puppy; Bennett, US Postal Service carrier; and Lucy, assistant at the sheriff's department. When they hear about the death of the town's high school football hero and all around bad boy, Lucy wants to investigate...her goal with her weight loss is to become a deputy not just an office worker. In support of her, they find themselves in the midst of an investigation that seems to be pointing to an innocent girl, Whitney. Are they able to figure out who really killed Brinkley or will this be their own downfall. The story goes back and forth between the mystery and the townspeople involved in it and their own weight loss angst situations. There are some wonderful diet recipes throughtout the book. For anyone who has ever struggled with weight loss and food addictions, this book hits the spot with the Flab Five's daily battles to lose the pounds.

In fact, it's much more creamy than peanut butter. In fact, I'd agree with another reviewer: after shipping, the butter emerges from the jar in almost pure liquid form.

7958,"I really like this burlap garlic sack. I have grown garlic in the summer and been wondering what the best way is to store all thee garlic bulbs. This burlap garlic sack seems like the perfect solution. It is moisture wicking, breathable and impenetrable to light - the perfect place to keep garlic. This sack is very well made. The outer burlap fabric allows air to pass through. It has a printed classic design on both sides of the sack, a draw string to keep the opening closed and a loop on the side for hanging. The inner removable pouch is made of opaque and breathable fabric . It does a great job of blocking out light while keeping the interior cool and dry.

Overall, this is a great sack for storing garlic. It keep them fresh and well. It also looks attractive either on the kitchen countertop or hanging from a kitchen hook. Well made and practical. I would probably get the other Now Designs burlap sacks for onions and potatoes as well. Anyhow, I would highly recommend this product.",4,"[-1.4455902899318462, -1.1525903162196494, -1.3011228481130777, -0.9936622905157158, -0.9396734388252942]",-0.9396734388252942

5913,"I have to admit, I have been waiting for Savannah to die since the beginning of this series.  Not that I have anything against her.  To the contrary, Ive never really developed any feelings for her at all. We see plenty of Gideon, but Savannah, has always just kind of existed benignly. Maybe its that. Or maybe the Black Dagger Brotherhood has destroyed my ability to trust in a pre-existing relationship. (Poor Wellsie!) But whatever the case, I figured it was only a matter of time until she bit the big one and eventually Gideon would fall in love again, but this time on page. I guess I need to rethink that, now that Lara Adrian has given us their origin story.

Im glad she wrote this. It gives this couple some depth. But I cant say I loved the romance.

Savannah is only 18 years old as this novella begins. We learn she has the gift of psychometry and can get glimpses of an objects history when she touches it.  Shortly after she discovers an old sword at her university, someone kills her best friend, hoping to get it. Gideon hears her talking about it on tv, and recognizes it as the sword he wielded centuries ago. He suspects a Rogue was behind the attack and goes looking for Savannah to get more clues.

It takes a while for these two to meet up, but once they do, its pretty much love at first sight.  OK, lust at first sight. Its a whole day or two before its love. But regardless, its WAY too fast.  I just couldn't make any kind of emotional connection. I also had a problem with just how young Savannah is. The older I get, the younger 18 seems.

I did like seeing the beginnings of Gideons geekiness and I liked the flashback of how the Order was back in the 70s!  This is a prequel novella, but I wouldnt recommend new readers start here. Theres just not enough to it. Wait until you are a few books into the series for maximum enjoyment.

2773,"Tortured Skye: A Hawke Family Novel (The Hawke Family Book 2) by Gwyn McNamee 5 stars

Please, please, please read Savage Collision (Book 1) first. This is one of those series that you really want to read in order. Also, please note that in my first review I said Savage was my new book boyfriend, well Ive moved on. Gabe Anderson is now my book boyfriend (Sorry Savage).

Skye Hawke has had some tragedy in her life and has worked like the dickens to overcome and move on. Its not easy and everyone looks at her just a little differently. Skye is a grown woman who still has some bratty tendencies. She is a professional in the work place and is still trying to find her new place in her family. Her new reality is a little hard for her to take sometimes because of guilt and part of her soul being missing.

Gabe understands about soul connections because he and her brother Savage have a similar connection. Herein lies the problem. Skye is Gabes best friends little sister. Ruh roh - you see where this is going, right? Gabe served several tours of duty, suffers from PTSD as well as a few other issues and tries really hard to work on himself and move on in his life. He knows right from wrong and struggles with decisions.

I was so excited to read this book. I just knew there was a story behind Gabe and what makes him tick. I was not disappointed in even one page of this story.

Once again, I go on record as saying Gwyn McNamee must be a pen name. Her sophomore book does not read as someone who is still honing her craft. If this really IS only her second book as a writer, I cannot imagine how awesome Stones book will be. I will wait patiently for the next book in The Hawke Family Series.",4,"[-2.323908447449281, -1.7083676064255904, -1.2923515392356328, -1.002741272232705, -0.9406731504963971]",-0.9406731504963971

686,"If you have read any of Ellis' previous books you know the author has an uncanny knack/ability/talent in telling an historical tale without wasting any words - concise is an understatement. Providing perspective, context, analysis and brief biographical sketches, he gives the reader - if not a new insight - a clearer one as to how and why things happened as they did. Revolutionary Summer is no exception.

Focusing on the major players - Washington, Jefferson and Adams on the American side and the Howe brothers on the British - during the ""Summer of 1776"" - Ellis provides a new twist by tying together the political machinations with what was occurring on the military front; connecting the seemingly obvious dots and highlighting a cause and effect if you will, between the two. There is also a very engaging narrative here - All of this in a little less than 200 pages.

3339,"There are many books written in diary format in zombie-world, and very few of them that I particularly enjoyed. If I had known that Apocalypse Z was written as a diary, I therefore probably would have passed it over, but I'm glad I didn't. I believe that the name of the main character is never revealed, and although there's a chance it's my memory failing me, I'm pretty sure from one of the final scenes of the book that this is on purpose. So for the purposes of my review I shall call him Survivor Man.

Originally written in Spanish, and translated recently into English, Apocalypse Z is the journal of Survivor Man, a widowed lawyer, and his cat, Lucullus, and their experience of the global zombie apocalypse. What I really liked about the journal format in this case was that he does include a lot of information about the fall of the world to the undead, and that his journey always has a purpose - whether searching for other survivors, or escaping a bunch of dodgy sailors and their crazy captain - and he's also dedicated to his cat.

Pets in the apocalypse are rarely touched upon, and although there a few examples of dogs as companions or family members while fighting zombies, this is probably the first one I've come across with a cat - and as a cat person, it was a huge added bonus.

There was a turn in the plot halfway through, when Survivor Man meets a bunch of sailors on their ship, and this is where Apocalypse Z lost me a little, because I didn't really understand the point of it, and it all seemed a little far fetched and unnecessary. It did drive the rest of the plot, but it didn't sit very well with me - it felt like the author had imagined the most unlikely scenario possible just for the sake of having something unique, rather than something that fit.

Overall Apocalypse Z is a good, solid zombie read. It didn't blow me away, but it was enough to keep me satisfied and turning the pages, and I loved that the main character was so dedicated to his cat, and treated it more like a person than 'just an animal'. It does have some unique aspects, but not all of them felt to me like they belonged. However, I'll be interested to see where this series goes next, however currently the next book is not yet translated into English.",2,"[-3.4112477567495327, -1.9233814972325876, -1.4654239240169418, -1.016793427249039, -0.9411604244365958]",-0.9411604244365958
444,"The things they carried includes the tangible; photographs, letters, the burdensome implements of war; and the intangible; worry, fear, courage, grief. O' Brien's novel feels genuine, plausible. Classified as fiction, it reads like fact. This is due in part to certain plot choices by the author including: a fictional character who shares his name and occupation (a forty-three-year old writer and father); a chapter entitled Notes about the inspiration behind a certain story (the receipt of a letter from a fellow platoon member); and the account of a return trip to Vietnam with his daughter. Typically included in the short story genre, The Things They Carried is actually a series of vignettes about the man who seems to be but is not the actual author, and the men in his platoon. The stories are arranged chronologically at times, other not, and are reflections of lives of the men before, during and after the war in Vietnam: what they did, how they felt, how they dealt. Although the accounts are alternately inspiring, depressing, and bizarre, they never lose their authentic feel. The Things They Carried provides an excellent, unconventional look at war.",4,"[-2.034412925150982, -0.9412349272638324, -1.10900079432855, -0.9946807624419396, -1.3782024677684002]",-0.9412349272638324

Story line of a nefarious individual seeking a military contract by blackmailing a university professor into slipping a 'dream cocktail' to unsuspecting students/faculty with sometimes dire health consequences kept me reading long into the night. Thoughts of individuals unknowingly swilling a concoction to have dreams so real that they virtually lived the moment at Pearl Harbor or flew on the Doolittle Raid was right up my alley, tossed in with a likable protagonist, plenty of twists and turns and no real profanity to speak of I'd say this book should have universal appeal.

9579,"Exploring racism and police misconduct in a mixed neighborhood, Freedomland had ambitious goals and tried to tell it's story without taking a position. As the film moves forward, it becomes very clear which way the films writers are leaning, and it defeats the films intended purpose. Julianna Moore plays a woman who claims she was carjacked in the black part of town. Samuel L. Jackson, one of the detectives assigned to the area, goes to investigate, and when he interviews the victim, she drops a bombshell, telling Jackson that her 5 year old son was in the car. We all know that Samuel L. Jackson is a legend and he performed like one in this film, but the problem was Julianne Moore. I get that she's playing a mother who is missing her kid, but she was so whiny and out of it the whole film, that every scene she was in was just painful to watch. Add to that the fact that she's trying to use some southern redneck accent, and she was barely understandable. A white woman claiming her child was kidnapped by a black man is the premise of the film and leads to the police putting down the hammer on the black part of town. It was a story that could have gone in so many terrific directions, but instead it falls flat on it's face, with nonsensical sub-plots, shotty performances, and of course a writer who did anything but tell his story objectively. The investigative part of the film was pretty interesting and Samuel L. Jackson is always great, but overall Freedomland is a cliche, that plays on racial conflict in order to get people to watch it.",2,"[-1.4087342068623445, -1.3866677715780207, -0.9434475359525433, -0.987521275714589, -1.2747738848632433]",-0.9434475359525433

2341,"Earlier books in the Chop Chop series have touched upon the relationship between Jordan and Charlotte, now we get to hear their fully story.  Friends since childhood, in high school Jordan and Charlotte fall in love, but a pregnancy from her previous relationship drives Charlotte away from Jordan.  They are given a chance to reconnect, and start a life together.  But it turns out life is never exactly as one expects it to be.

We all know how much I love this series, and each time I read another book from it, I am convinced that book is the best of them all.  This one is no exception.  I love that this series has delivered an entire cast of characters, all of whom we as readers have come to care about, quite deeply.  For many of the books in the series, we followed the same few characters closely, with a supporting cast.  Now, we get to know some of the members of this supporting cast a little better.

I loved getting to hear Jordan and Charlotte's respective stories.  I feel like they more fully developed as characters through this book.  No one likes to see people they care about go through hardships, so reading about the struggles of these characters is difficult, but worthwhile in the end.  Jordan and Charlotte grow through those struggles, and so do we as readers.

Cronk consistently provides us with examples of real relationships, going through real struggles, and using faith to weather those storms.  It is no surprise these books touch so many lives.

175,"I won't take your time to summarize the plot of Buried On Avenue B, as you can read about it in the Amazon Book Description above. Instead, my review will try to explain why I think you should save your time and money and pass on reading Buried On Avenue B.

First off, with the exception of the main character, Homicide Detective Darlene O'Hara, author Peter De Jonge provides characterizations of the book's many people that are one-dimensional at best. The characters come in and out of the book so quickly that a scorecard is needed to keep track of them. Because of this, I found myself not only uninterested in any of the characters (except for Darlene), I couldn't care less about any of them.

A second important criticism is that there is no action that the reader gets to experience ""first hand."" In place of action and suspense, the reader gets to take part in the seemingly never-ending travelogue Det. O'Hara embarks on in search of clues, clues and more clues about who the person buried on Avenue B really was and why he was murdered. By this I mean you start off with her in NYC, then travel with her to Florida, then on to S. Carolina, then back to Florida and, finally, back to NYC. During all of this, very little happens; and what did happen, wasn't particularly interesting -- and it certainly wasn't exciting.

Finally, despite all of this searching for clues by O'Hara and the other seasoned detectives she was involved with on this case, they all missed the one clue that was not right under their noses from the beginning, so to speak. And to make matters worse, by the time this major revelation was figured out, my basic reaction to this ending was ""who cares!"" After being bored during most of my travels with Det. O'Hara in Buried On Avenue B, I couldn't wait to travel on to my next book, which hopefully will be worth my time and money.

I hope this review helps you to decide on avoiding Buried On Avenue B and to save your time and money for another book.",1,"[-1.7188325803026285, -0.945759731620574, -1.2607248520932928, -0.974183626403627, -1.121526807120063]",-0.945759731620574
3046,"""He defied an emperor and inspired a faith."" The Advocate is historical fiction, the story of Theophilus, a character about whom very little is known. As a fourteen-year-old Theophilus suffers crucifixion at the hands of his peers, leading to his education continuing in Greece. Through his association with Pontias Pilate he was instrumental in the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, a decision he later regrets and spends the rest of his life in remorse and atonement. Political and legalistic protocol from that time in history is the focus throughout this well researched book.

Incorporating historical fact with fiction Randy Singer has created a powerful novel that is unforgettable. This book is not for the faint of heart. There is graphic detailing of violence and bloodshed, an open and realistic portrayal of the life and times. Detailing and historical accuracy reveal the author's in-depth research in order to bring this book to fruition. Details in legalism and the customs from this period in history are compelling. This is a tough book to digest, with much to absorb, but well worth the time to read and ponder the events from that period of time.

But Michael Wallace has added good characterization, an intriguing plot and the promise of more to come in a series of books.

Since so many others have commented on the plot, let me say I was most impressed by his aptly named character Jacob Christianson and his sister, Eliza, who rather than act like the puppets many assume they might be, don't hesitate to question the tenets of their faith when it conflicts with reason and their own morality.

Though his focus is on a spinoff polygamous Mormon group, the situation could be applicable to many of the fundamentalist sects spawned by most any of the major modern religions and raises many timely questions. At the same time, it's a fast-paced and absorbing read.

532,"This book is beautifully written, but I appreciated it more than I enjoyed reading it. In lyrical first-person prose, Barry tells the story of Thomas McNulty and his closest companion John Cole. These two soulmates meet as teenagers in the 1850s and fight alongside each other in the Indian Wars, then the Civil War. Along the way, they take in an orphaned young Sioux girl named Winona and the three of them form a makeshift family.

It's a story that's both brutal and tender, its poignancy quietly sneaking up on you. I was reminded at once of Cormac McCarthy and Annie Proulx. McNulty and Cole are the kinds of characters you don't usually encounter in these narratives; they're comfortably aware of their love for each other and find a way to carve out a life together whatever way they can.

The prose was tough for me to get through, though. As much as I liked the characters, it was so plot-driven that I wished it had forgone the dense war scenes and straightforward plot advancements for more focus on the characters. I know it was written the way it was deliberately, and I'm not saying it didn't work. I just would have preferred something different.

Still dealing with horrific situations, Hosseini develops his story using historical facts of the devastation of Afghanistan.  Reading his book I oftentimes wondered why everyone in Afghanistan didn't commit suicide.  It would have ended the collective pain much sooner.
But Hosseini shows a spirit of hope in the Afghani soul, and a desire to compartmentalize atrocities so life can continue with a degree of normalcy.  You will be introduced to remarkable characters as well as some who will leave you cold.
One of my gripes, and why I didn't give this book five stars, is because there are too many characters who are ""good"" or ""evil"".  If all you can say about a major character is that he's abusive, then he isn't well developed.

Lola is definitely a quirky character. Not only does she love wearing the craziest costumes everyday, but she's also snarky and innocent. Set in San Francisco and living with two fathers, her background is very unique and interesting and you'll see all of that unfold throughout the book. The romance and love story is subtle and cute, again, a book that would appeal to teens.

One of my favorite aspects was that Anna and St. Clair make appearances all throughout the book. Now, you should know that you didn't have to read Anna and the French Kiss before reading this book, there is nothing that relates to them significantly here to make you feel like you're missing anything. It's just fun for those who have read that book to see these characters again and catch up with their lives a bit. And if you haven't read that book, it might even get you interested in checking it out.

One thing I couldn't stand, was the name Cricket. Don't get me wrong, I really liked Cricket, sweet and funny guy, clear spark between him and Lola, but I hate his name. It's mentioned so many times throughout the book, obviously, it kind of annoyed me and I was like ""Why, Stephanie, why?!"". Yes, it's different and memorable, but I'm not a fan.

Anyways, as far as the story goes, I really enjoyed it. Stephanie's writing is fun, cute, and appealing. I liked this a bit more than Anna and the French Kiss though, simply because Lola and Cricket's love seemed to flow better and Lola's struggles to discover and be proud of herself and realizing her feelings for Cricket was entertaining and genuine.

I was a little squinked out with Pikes insistence that Zack come out of the closet. In a lot of ways thats the primary plot of the book, Zack coming out, be it for Pike or himself. But he was very clearly in a situation that wasn't safe to come out in, so the whole inferred, prove your love by coming out was uncomfortable for me.

The writing is smooth and easy to read, though the book did feel a little on the overly long side. Lastly, I did not realize until I was done with the book that it is a spin-off of another series (Gaymers). So, for those like myself, who are wary of spin-offs, this one stands on its own just fine.

To me this Novel, besides the obvious one of cruelty bestowed upon those in Auschwitz by Josef Mengele and his cruel experiments, this concentrates on his obsession of children who are twins or just different in some way, and how he uses them to detect changes in their behavior, as he does different things to each twin. The main twins that we follow are sisters Pearl and Stasha Zamorski.
I feel this story was based on each individuals strength of character, more than their weaknesses, their loyalty to each other rather than the separateness, their will to live, not to give into their assumed fates. The children used these qualities as they each lost parts of themselves, but they always saw beyond what they were going through, and that to me was the real message.
This story must have been so hard to write as it was to read, but we must never forget what suffering was caused and still is with the fear of a different ethnicity, a different way of lifestyle etc. This is a good reminder of what could happen again if we are not aware of what goes on around us.

Washington is seen as a solid general who knows when to fight and when to retreat. The British, for numerous reasons, never took the fight to the Americans when they had the opportunity to do so. The book will help anyone get a better understanding of how fragile the Revolution really was in 1776 as McCullough does an excellent job in writing about that historical year.

3972,"Ebooks have and are continuing to change the way we read books, with shorter chapters and a growing popularity in short stories, ideal for reading on your particular ereader on the go just about anywhere. When it comes to horror, you want to make sure you find a good story to enjoy, and the first volume of Dark Screams features some big names in the genre and at a very reasonable price.

The opening story and high-point of the collection, Weeds by one Stephen King, is about a meteor that crashes to the earth and the weedy alien life upon it begins to grow in this world as well as on one of its inhabitants. The next story keeps the thrill and chill going with The Price You Pay by Kelley Armstrong about the price of debts, and how some can never be repaid.

Sadly, the collection goes downhill from there with the remaining three stories from Bill Pronzini, Simon Clark and Ramsey Campbell doing little to stimulate the mind and are just dark and don't really go anywhere whether its about a strange member of an asylum or a doomed person trapped in a chamber of torture. Nevertheless, Dark Screams: Volume One is worth the read for a reader looking to experiment in the genre.

Taryn has a painful history. Shes well known (famous celebrity due to that painful event) and has a past with the lead singer of a rock band. To say her personal life is complicated is an understatement.

And then enter Chase, the son and brother to another pair famous musician who spiraled out at age 18. He knows his limitations - he thinks - and thats where the story takes off. Theres a LOT in this book about the back end of the music business, and it was interesting. Taryn, as young as she is, is smart and knows how it works.  Im still trying to figure out how Chase went from a teenage addict to a millionaire land developer, though. Did he show a proclivity for it when he was younger, and I missed it?

I plan on buying copies for many of my father's friends and others interested in WWII. We know Roald Dahl as a dark children's author and husband of Patrica Neal. I had read her autobiography which gave little hint to her husband's early years as an American Ambassador charged with much more than the usual diplomacy. Set in upper society Washington, one gets a glimpse rarely seen in politics; all of the wheeling and dealing that go on, even under their own noses. I especially liked the detailed accounts of the dinners and meetings. Rich in detail and narrative, this book is a wonderful read. I had my husband read it (A Brit himself) and he was happy to see that his favorite ""spy"", Ian Flemming plays an important role in the tale.

1221,"Michael Crummy's quirky ""Galore"", with  sparks of brilliant writing was, unfortunately for me a considerable let down.  Landscapes and human prospects are equally bleak in a town ironically know as Paradise Deep and one more aptly named neighbor,  Gut.  Inhabitants are invariably (and soon) tiresomely quirky.  Characters like Devine's Widow, the matriarchal wiccan contrasted to a drunken and sybaritic RC Father Phelan.  Protestants v. Catholics and children like Mary Tryphena grow to marry not their heart's love but the washed ashore detritus that reeks of dead fish. Good luck...

Indeed Mary Tryphena, Judah and Absalom are the exception, being somewhat fleshed out.  People sort of float in and out without much purpose except to move the years along.  Crummy never stays with anyone very long so Judah may or not be a lucky talisman; Jabez Trim and his wife ache for children and ultimately succeed but we hardly know of their joy.  Indeed, joy and even satisfaction are noticeably absent from the lives any of these Labradorians.  Everyone just sort of drifts from crankiness to misery to shortage to bad weather-- flotsam in nature's harsh and uncompromising universe.

I don't think it necessarily bad that the author depict something so dreary and unpleasant, but I would like to know why anyone in their right mind would want to stay in such a harsh and depressing place. Habit?  Lack of imagination? Masochism?  When Absalom is banished for falling in love with his first cousin I wanted to shout ""run, Abie run, and don't look back.""  Banishment seemed like the lotto jackpot.  Unfortunately we don't know what ties these folk to such a miserable and forbidding place.  And that is a pity.

But reader opinions on these review pages differ greatly, which, I guess, accounts for so many ""not helpful"" votes on reviews both pro and con. I can only speak for this particular Wodehouse fan, who had a grand time.

Our story begins with a delightfully ridiculous role reversal for its two leading men, with Bertie assuming the role of gentleman's gentleman, and Jeeves taking on the role of the gentleman this gentleman's gentleman serves. So much for the what of it. Now how about the why behind such derring-do: Because it's the only way our heroes could think up to get themselves invited for a stay at Melbury Hall, where they are desperately needed to help Bertie's pal Woody regain the affections of the daughter of the house, his beloved Amelia, who has broken off their engagement because she has come to believe --mistakenly, of course-- that Woody has developed a bad case of (Yikes!) Roving Eye.

And so the risky masquerade begins. Meanwhile, other romances take root. And it all ends with one heckuva surprise that I, for one, didn't see coming.

5325,"Lauren has become one of my favorite authors when it comes to true romance stories. Not just in the general sense of romance itself, but the whole scenario it takes to get to the end result of it. You know, the meeting of two soles, the getting to know you routine,, the butterflies and palpitations of the heart when the lust kicks in which leads into the ultimate does he feel the same way I do romance. However, it is not just the romance itself that I enjoy reading, but Lauren always throws in twists and turns to keep her stories very interesting to her readers and this story did that as well.

You take two people and they just happen to work together. One is divorce and has become skeptical about the affairs of the heart and the other one has never been in love and no intentions of succumbing to the bliss, but wants a baby.  So, you can see where the twist to the story could come into play.

Lauren has ways to her storytelling that just draws me in and I do not want to place down my Kindle while reading. Her storylines involving the characters are so intriguing and loveable. Plus, throwing in the mix of past characters from previous books is wonderful. Even though you don't have to read her previous books to appreciate this book, but it just gives you that extra familiarity to other characters when they are visiting.

As with all of Lauren's books, I highly recommend this story. I fell in love with the main characters Ryder and Nicole and I am sure you, the reader, will too.

What I liked about this book:
Ben and Renee--they were perfect for each other. Renee is funny and has the ability to laugh at herself when things get crazy. She has an interesting job that sounds fun. Ben has a great sense of humor, and I love a hero with a sense of humor.
Secondary characters Chuck, Janice and Eve--they are all nice and sincerely cared about Renee.

What I didn't like:
Ben was awfully quick to believe what Tracy said about Renee, so his hero crown got a little tarnished for me.
Janice is a great friend to Renee, but when Renee was wallowing after the outcome of the show (we all need to wallow after a big setback, especially in the romance department, Janice tells her she needs to take a shower. If one of my friends ever said that to me when I was down, I'd be really mad.
When Renee was relesed from the hospital, the author made it seem liked she walked out on her own--I've been in the hospital numerous times and they have to take you out in a wheelchair when you're released.

I perused it to get a jest of the storyline, and to see if it was appropriate for him. He reads far above his grade level, and this was perfect. He started the book the minute it was given to him, and he continued reading until bedtime.

This may not be a book for all children, it has some dark places, but the storyline as a whole has a good message for everyone. I think the 10 and above age level is appropriate. This is a surprisingly fun read, and it opens the mind for a lot of questions and conversations.

Star is a black Pegasus that is born once every 100 years.  This particular Pegasus will become the black foal of the century with particular powers on its first birthday.  This will give Star such a power over any other pegasi. With this power, Star can be a Good vs Evil, if it is chosen. It is for you to find out what occurs when you and your child read this book. I found this can be a fun book to read chapter by chapter to your child each day. This gives time to ask and answer questions. If your child is more independent, and he wants to read it by himself, by all means. It will then be fun to discuss the book to see what message your child has taken away from his reading of the book.

This is the first book for this author, who has quite a vivid imagination. It will be fun to see if this develops into a series as purported.

2731,"I read this book about two years ago and read it again today and it touched me as deeply as the first time around. The pain of loss through war experienced by Belladonna and Paola haunts one just as lost opportunities experienced by Jack and Lucy tear at one's heart. If only .......  However, Belladonna sees what no one else does, and she persuades Jack to accompany Lucy on a trip to Italy after her death to return a painting to Paola. The quest is not as easy as first hoped, but along the way they learn more about Lucy's grandmother and her love story. Although Jack and Lucy accomplish what they set out to do, the trip does not end well.  Jack has to rethink his strategy to win Lucy the second time around and Lucy has to let go of past disappointments before she can move forward.  Although romantic love was central to this story, it is the romance of Italy, of divine food and interpersonal relationships that draw the reader in and touches the heart.

This is a story of love/lust at first sound, great friends crazy Ex and giving love a chance despite all your fears.
After meeting Jody (which is a girl's name by the way) Lacey has a very overwhelming reaction to him, the chemistry and attraction between the two is powerful to the point where it terrifies them both.
""He was driving her mad And she was either going to make him stop or Tell him to throw her upon the table and have at it""
Caveman meets Alpha on speed. possessive much? Jody had a rough childhood, after his father walked out when he was only 10 years old he had to become the man of the house and protect his little sister. So now a 36 year old man he is....a tad POSSESSIVE. Apart from that he is an absolute sweetheart. He is a big bad and mean on the ice but off he is a complete soft marshmallow.
Lacey is a very independent women with  an Audi R8 and serious trust issues with men. Well you really can't blame her,  she is only trying to Protect her heart after she caught her  Ex On what was suppose to be their wedding day screwing on of the bridesmaid.
When she finally threw caution to the wind and give into what she feels for Jody they sizzled and the love between them grow
""I don't know how to describe what I feel. It's like wherever we are, when I'm with you, I feel like I am home""~Jody
This man is just the sweetest he treat Lace like a queen. Because she IS the queen of his world.
Nikki tells this story in the third person which allows us a small insight into what all the characters were thinking/feeling. I loved that the book was not only focused on the main characters but all the secondary cast received a voice.

She lives from one case to the next and Michelle has to juggle what bills to pay when as they hope for the next case to come through the door.
She drives an old Mercedes that craps out occasionally and guzzles gas. (This part is stupid to me because the repair costs on one alone justify getting something cheaper to drive.)
Her mother is a narcissist who never told her who her father is.
(Right after reading that far I was making comparisons with THE LINCOLN LAWYER and his half brother Bosch.)
After two young women were murdered and a cop is charged with the case, he comes to hire her to defend him. She has never defended a cop so she's not sure about taking the case.
After she does she finds out he's her father.
He has anger issues.
She has a stepsister.
He was dating one of the women, an actress, who he met while investigating a burglary at their apartment. (Another hard to get around idea.) they fought and broke up that night because she was using drugs again. Neighbors heard the fight.
The book goes on through her doubts about her new father, getting ready for trial, the trial, and investigations into who might have done it if daddy Dale didn't.
It's well written and I felt the authors experience in the courtroom added a great deal to the writing.

1383,"Oh I liked this book a lot! This was a true southern book. I had to keep reminding myself that it takes place in the 1940's so things were a little different back then. Yes, this story is kind of unreal and unbelievable - but it was fiction! And really, it did seem to fit. I don't think I would have wanted it any other way. It made it more fun.

I love books about women who run away for one reason or another and want to start their life over somewhere else - and this was a good one! Vada was on the run. She ran from one man's arms right into another, but happened to meet a bunch of wonderful people on the way.

I wasn't so sure about the romance that was so very quickly developing between Vada and Frank. It seemed way too fast and unreal and it didn't give me a chance to get to know him. I was glad when Vada decided to slow things down - sensible woman. I then ended up liking Frank.

Claire was a true secondary character and was just as much a part of this story as was Vada. I liked both girls equally and loved the way their friendship strengthened over time but was there right from the first meeting. I have had that kind of friendship, when you just know that you are going to be friends.

And then there's Darby! - she is there throughout the whole book but you don't meet her until the very end. That was kind of neat idea.

This book had a very good ending and there were a few surprises thrown in there! All-in-all this was a very fun and very enjoyable read! I highly recommend it! I loved the author's writing style and I definitely want to go back and read The Wisdom Of Hair.

Katie Logan works for Child Protective Services and is engaged to her supervisor, Grant.  Katie labels it an inevitable engagement after three years of dating.  She knows that the reason she is thirty-four and never been engaged before is because she has always compared every man to her best friend from childhood, Johnny Church.  Johnny is now a rock star.  One night, when Grant is out of town, Johnny shows up and sparks fly.  Neither realizes that the other has fantasized about them ever since high school. Now, what about Grant?

I read this book two months ago, and for some reason never got the review written up.  Today, I was spending time cleaning up files on my computer and the half-file was a reminder.  I realized, I didn't even need to pick up the book, I remember everything about this story.  I think that says a lot about it.  I loved Johnny and identify well with goody two shoes Katie who has dropped herself into an emotional cauldron.  The book is extremely well-written with a comfortable, believable pace of story.

This is a stand-alone book from one of my favorite authors, Jade C. Jamison.  Well, it was supposed to be, but sometimes the fans demand, and, even better, the author capitulates.  So this is now the first in a series.  The next book is a follow-up called EVERYTHING BUT.  I will be reading and reviewing the follow-up sometime in February.

746,"There are so many books out there that promise to help you find your path in life, to help you achieve meaning, that it's tough to know which one to read -- and which one will be different than the others.

I've read scores of these types of books, and ""The Purpose Driven Life"" is different in several ways. First, it offers you a step-by-step plan for creating a sense of meaning in your life. Second, it's based in scripture. Third, it advocates making the church the center of your life.

These differences can also be the book's drawbacks. I always sensed that the author had a bit of an agenda -- being a pastor of a huge church, of course he believes in the importance and sanctity of organized religion. But what if you aren't a member of a church? What if your church is dysfunctional? What if you feel called to do things outside your church?

I for one believe that God has given us different talents and different strengths and different passions. SOME of us are called to serve in the church. And some of us are called elsewhere. Warren seems to ignore those of us who are pulled to serve others and use our talents outside of our church. After reading this book twice (once on my own and once through a small-group study through my church), I was still left with many, many questions -- and a deep-seated feeling that there was more to life than what Warren had presented.",2,"[-1.2553330362292565, -1.3192194328122318, -0.9564969939285735, -1.0248114022573223, -1.1107896498723724]",-0.9564969939285735

Accompanied by his wife and a group of fellow history members of the Berry sponsored organization ""History Matters"" they search out little known aspects of the past that don't coincide with writings in history books.  For example, prior to publishing The 14th Colony Mr Berry wrote the ""Patriot Threat"" in which he indicated that the US Income Tax might be illegal.  This premise is utilized in the that book as part of the plot described.
  Similarly, in the current novel, the 14th colony is indicated as the present country of Canada.  It is indicated that at three distinct periods during the history of the US, plans were drawn up to invade and annex the country of Canada. These plans never came to fruition but were present and available if the US government decided they should be followed.
  Cotton Malone is the protagonist again utilized by Mr. Berry.  In addition, Malone's on again, off again girlfriend Cassiopeia  makes an appearance  with an eye towards reconciliation with Cotton.  Ordered to Siberia by his ex boss on a temporary assignment in order to meet with Alexandr Zorin Malone is forced to parachute into the area.  He is captured by the Russians but escapes meeting up with Cassiopeia who has been sent to help him and together they pursue Zorin into Canada's Prince Edward Island.  Zorin picks up a Russian sleeper agent left over from the cold war and living in Canada.  The two make their way into the United States and eventually to the White House in time for the inauguration of a new president.
  The actuality of the planned invasion of Canada, and a flaw written into the order of succession of US presidents in the eventuality of deaths of several of those in line are utilized as aiding and abetting the two Russians in their plot.  What they plan to use is one of five suitcase nuclear bombs stored away for many years. The book is definitely an all nighter keeping the reader mesmerized  following the rapid action and events described.

1995,"A Note Yet Unsung by Tamera Alexander is a welcome addition to my readings this winter. This book takes place in Victorian Nashville and introduces us to Rebekah Carrington and Tate Whitcomb. Rebekah is a natural musician and a master of several instruments, her dream is to play in the male-dominated symphony. Tate is the director of the Nashville symphony and refuses her admittance. They both overcome numerous obstacles as they weave through the troubles of their pasts and realize they need each other. Very well written and nearly 400 pages, this is one to savor. I enjoyed every minute of this book except for the part when a character referred to a black man as a N*****. I thought that could have been left out or simply referred to as a slur.",4,"[-2.363391298026452, -1.4772223434044855, -1.1637514655104122, -0.9998678890773323, -0.9571743816815506]",-0.9571743816815506
1424,"With her vampire ex-boyfriend heading out of town, Sookie Stackhouse looks forward to more peaceful (and lonely) times in small-town Louisianna. But when her brother starts dating a shape-shifter and hunky vampire Sheriff, Eric loses his memory and Sookie finds him running naked near her house, she realizes that the times will be anything but peaceful. With his memory intact, Eric was a jerk but he's sort of sweet without it--and Sookie has a hard time fighting the attraction. Still, she's made a new year's resolution--no more getting beat up. And if she hangs with Eric and the other vampires, she knows she's going to get hurt.
When her brother turns up missing, though, Sookie realizes that she can't just lay low. And with witches trying to take over nearby Shreveport (where Eric is from), it doesn't take long before she's in the middle of the fight of her life. There is one bit of good news. Despite a great figure and good looks, Sookie's mind-reading always scared away the normal males. But as she meets shifters, witches, vampires, and even a fairy, there are plenty of non-human and half-human males who find Sookie just what they are looking for--assuming she can survive long enough to create a relationship.
Author Charlaine Harris mixes up humor, suspense, magic, and a really nice character in Sookie Stackhouse for an especially strong entry into her Southern Vampire series. In a world where amoral vampires and amoral humans wage war for control, Sookie provides an ethical perspective and a bit of balance. Her concern for her missing brother and her ambivalent feelings toward Eric increase reader empathy with Sookie and our stakes in the outcome.

374,"I really liked this story!

Though parts of it didn't feel totally accurate--smaller details, mostly; overall it was fairly plausible historical fiction--the story was entertaining and the characters extremely likable. And though I shuddered slightly when Gabriella was hanging out with spiders and beetles (spiders! and beetles!) it was really easy to adore her character anyway. And Raphe...ah, Raphe. You've got to love a guy who's been taking care of his younger sisters since the age of eight and somehow managed to educate all three of them himself. (One of the aforementioned details--where on earth would they get books as penniless, parentless kids living in St. Giles? But still, it's hard not to love characters who get excited by libraries and bookstores, so I'll go with it :))

Also very interesting to note that though there's chemistry galore here and all kinds of lusting after each other, actual sexytimes are sparse. I actually didn't miss it--it was nice to focus on the relationship for a change...plus, chemistry and lust and hot and heavy dreams filled in the gap nicely ;)

Raphe's younger sister Amelia is clearly being set up as the heroine of the next book, and I am so there, people! Can't wait!

Her family doesn't know where she has run off too, but she does keep in contact with her dad.

Dylan is trying his hardest to stay away from her but it becomes impossible for him when he finds out that someone has broken into Emma's place and he insists on her moving in with him.

Though the book got off to a slow start with a lot of back-story, Jance provides a convoluted plot, engaging characters and sufficient suspects to keep a reader turning pages. I targeted the right suspect fairly early but Jance threw in a twist on motivation which went beyond my initial suspicion.

His true identity is unknown to the public as he had made a pact with an Elvis-impersonator that went wrong.  Elvis's friend Jack (Ossie Davis) is the only one who believes that he is the king, but Jack also believes that he is the John F. Kennedy.  Elvis is currently bed-ridden in the nursing home as a result of a stage accident where he broke his hip three years ago.  Between sleeping, eating, and using the bed pan Elvis has bizarre dreams and visions that often launch philosophical thoughts of getting old and its consequences.  This monotony crawls under the skin of Elvis as he decides to get out of the bed and use the restroom for once.  However, it seems as if Elvis's adventure to the lavatory leads to a darker secret that seems to drain the life out of the residents of the nursing home.  Bubba Ho-Tep is a comical and well-written horror story that the director Coscarelli adapts to the silver screen with a delicate touch of humor and suspense.  The comedy is improved with Bruce Campbell's performance as Elvis, which will give the audience reason to burst out in loud laughter several times.  Bruce Campbell also brings out a raw, but sensitive side of the old Elvis that suffers from health problems and other dysfunctions that comes with age.

""The Constant Gardener"" is a slow moving but highly engaging film.  The story is interesting and timely, and provides an insight in to modern day Africa and its politics.  Both Fiennes and Weisz are more than capable in the lead roles, and make the Quales real human beings.  The biggest drawback of the film is the hand-held camera shots that are very distracting from the story.  They almost make you feel more detatched from the story.

From the very first page this book had my full attention.  I loved the characters and how they handled living together in this store.  As the story progressed I was really torn to put the book down.  After the death of Robbie and Mr. Applegate it felt like it was really starting to climax.  Then Jake went outside and this was very thrilling to see the outside world, but then he just says he can't do it anymore and strips and disappears???

But even though they were going to sedate and restrain the dangerous members of the family, he didn't want them to go along.  So after sedating one of the little children he has her removed from the bus to stay behind with the other aggressive blood types.  I was a bit taken aback by this.  This poor little girl that just wanted to see her family again and the last thing she knew she was going to be rescued is now betrayed by the very ones protecting her and left behind???  Then the bus leaves and the book ends with five of them staying behind.  It felt like the author was attempting to make it a happy ending when it was more like, what?  I hung on the edge of my seat this whole time so they could stay behind and not rejoin their families???

By no means was this a bad book.  It's riveting and thrilling and full of suspense and I read it in one day.

1956,"Bitter Greens is a historical-fiction novel that is a very different re-telling of the story of Rapunzel- it entwines the story of 3 different women in different periods of time.  French novelist Charlotte-Rose de la Force is the actual historical figure who wrote the real story that Rapunzel is based on. Charlotte-Rose is forced to enter a convent after she has displeased the Sun King, Louis XIV where after a  life at the court of the king she learns a much harsher, bleaker life than the one she had become accustomed to.  In the convent she hears the story of Margherita (the Rapunzel of this story), a young girl who is taken from her parents at a young age and is forced to enter the same convent that Charlotte-Rose enters many years later.  Selena is the third woman in this tale that binds everyone together.  While some would see her as an evil sorceress (the Mother Gothel of this tale, if you're familiar with the Disney version), her story shows us what she goes through to become the cunning, vengeful, spirited woman that she is.

Kate Forsyth did a good job of researching the time period and presenting it in her novel, her language and characters seem very real and believable - for a historical novel it's quite good.  I struggled a bit in the beginning getting past the numerous French words thrown in frequently and kept stopping to look them up if I wasn't able to figure out their meaning as they were used in the sentence, but after a while it became easier.  I also had a bit of trouble throughout the book keeping track of who was speaking and the time period - the chapters jump around between characters and time periods.  Overall though I definitely like it - for those who like historical fiction or like non-traditional fairy tales I recommend it.  I also would recommend this for ages 18 and older, as there are some sex scenes in the book -a far cry from the Disney version, but far more believable.",3,"[-2.6811643361113497, -1.7512515779505275, -0.9599404773968171, -0.9975063092366883, -1.0572269101319074]",-0.9599404773968171

This is wonderful book about life. In this book we meet Mia & Declan who are married and have kids.

Mia has always had a crush on Noah a guy she went to high school with and has always had that what if feeling about him.

This is a great book for everyone to read, it opens up so many different feelings that I think we have all felt at one time or another. I even ended up having a discussion with my husband about some things that happened in the book. Not to mention it really makes you ask yourself is the grass really greener on the other side? I really loved all the characters in this book, they are all so normal and very likeable. I also like the way the book was written, the Author really lets you in on everything that happened with these characters from the first meeting to the outcome at the end of the book. This book is a great journey about finding the man of your dreams and trying to making it work, sticking it out during the hard times because lets face it every relationship has hard times at one point or another. It is also about living your life with no regrets and making sure you are making the right decisions for where you want your life to be.
This book was very hard to put down once I started it and while it is a love triangle it is not an overly emotional one (thank goodness because love triangles stress me out!).

Jackson has always had a thing for Abby, but has just never been able to admit it.  Hes too afraid of losing his best friend when she rejects him.  But shes back in town and he just cant seem to keep his lips to himself.  Abbys had a rough go of it since she left Sweet and Jackson is trying to help her rediscover herself and forget her jerk-of-an-ex-husband.  The only problem is that he is still very attracted to her and scared to death to let her know it.

While the whole town of Sweet sees that Jackson and Abby belong together, Jackson and Abby just cant seem to get together.  Is their friendship going to stand in the way of a once-in-a-lifetime kind of love?  Maybe a little help from the rest of the Wilder family will help steer them in the right direction

Loved this book!  The Abby and Jacksons story was simply amazing.  Their back story and chemistry made this story such a wonderful and enjoyable read. The setting of Sweet, Texas was delightful, with all the supporting characters that makes this series so much fun to read.  But don't worry, even though its part of a series, this is a great stand-alone read also!  I loved the way that Jacksons ex-wife was portrayed in such a wonderful light and the relationship that developed between Jacksons daughter Izzy and Abby was heartwarming.  Jacksons mom, Jana, and brothers also helped to add a bit of humor to the story.  And of course, I simply couldn't wait for Jackson and Abby to finally find their happy ending!  I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series, Something Sweeter.  Well done Ms. Terry!

I thought it was amusing to see how she butts heads with Samuel, an Amish man who tends the sick in their community the best he can even though he's not a doctor.  There's a little bit of a cute romance, but mostly it's just a cozy read about a girl returning to the family and community she misses and finding a new role in it.  I really liked all of the characters and realized that this actually precedes The Christmas Quilt, which I also really enjoyed.  I would recommend this cozy Christmas story!

Especially when the victim was one of three boys tried for the rape of a Cheyenne girl who suffered from fetal alcoholic syndrome. The three were basically acquitted.

The sheriff is a grieving widower, his best friend's a Cheyenne related to the girl, and his mentor is his predecessor, a retired one-legged sheriff living in a nursing home. Adding to the ambience, a local woman-made-good back in town is eyeing him.

I confess I began to suspect the murderer about half-way through but this still kept me interested. The history, of the native Americans in Wyoming and the Sharps rifle, are blended in, letting me learn probably more than I wanted to. But it was entertaining learning so I didn't mind.

859,"The Lincoln Lawyer appears to be the first in a new series - or at least a recurring character - for this author, of whom I am a big fan. The new protagonist, Mickey Haller, is a criminal defense lawyer that in many ways fits the sleazy stereotype - the guilt or innocence of his client is irrelevant as long as he or she can pay Mickey's fee. Haller works either in the court-room or from his Lincoln Town Car because time is money.

Mickey has sources and schemes working all over town to draw in clients and he is always on the look-out for the franchise client; one who is able and willing to pay whatever his defense will cost. Mickey is twice divorced - but yet both of his ""exes"" still like him and in fact one works for him. Haller is also the very absent father of a darling daughter - who misses her Daddy.

Early on in the book Haller lands a ""franchise client"" with deep pockets and a slam dunk case. The plot thickens though as this current case ties into Mickey's past. He soon begins to question his current client's innocence, while second guessing his defense of a previous client - which he may have mishandled - who is now serving a life sentence without parole for a crime - it now dawns on Mickey, he may not have committed.

Haller is not accustomed to such self-reflection, let alone caring about his clients' culpability - but with each twist and turn Mickey's franchise client - even with all his money - becomes a bargain with the devil.

Sounds simple - or at least predictable - but in this author's hands that's just the beginning.

As Connelly's books are character driven - with such complex protagonists as Harry Bosch and Terry McCaleb - Haller as the sleazy lawyer, i.e. a predictable character, could prove to be a handicap. Even in this first book, the reader can feel the tug of war going on within the writing, whether to portray Mickey as a rascal or scoundrel - a fine line but a distinct one. We readers will have to wait and see what Connelly decides. That being said, The Lincoln Lawyer is still a very good book and I wasn't disappointed.",3,"[-3.08427903083724, -1.0133494419397713, -1.462242061193513, -0.96147887925503, -1.4093139293267734]",-0.96147887925503

5 stars ***** out of five
Romantic Suspense

I enjoyed this book as it was a different pace than the novels I usually read. This story is about a teenage girl. The actions, words, incidents she gets herself in, her tendency to jump feet first into a situation without thinking things through, seem in characters for her age and position. As such, I found it at times to be very humorous, and delightful. It is well written, with Jenny growing and maturing through time and experience in a reasonable time frame. Love, forgiveness and trust are all a part of life, and we all learn it at some point, some more and sooner than others. Jenny's venture into the farming business adds another dimension to an already full story. There is lots of action, and also lots of characters, but none of that takes away from a great novel.
This book would be a great read for teenage girls as well as those of us that are young at heart. This is the first book I have read of Ada's novels, but am already looking for some of her others. They also sound interesting.

Thank you to Cheri and Fred at The Book Club Network, author Ada Brownell and Elk Lake Publishing for the opportunity to read this novel. I was given a free Ebook in exchange for an honest review.

1666,"Finding Audrey portrays social anxiety and depression in a heartfelt and true way while still keeping humor in the story. Being in Audrey's head it was easy to see how debilitating anxiety can be. I've never had social anxiety as bad as Audrey, but I do experience it from time to time and could really relate to what Audrey felt. Her family's acceptance and help throughout was touching and when Linus enters the picture, he joins her support group in the sweetest ways.

I also loved the side characters. Audrey's mom's idiosyncrasies were hilarious and her brother, Frank, created many laugh out loud moments. His obsession with video games (and in turn, his mom's obsession of ridding him of them) was so relevant to today and creates great comic relief from what could have been an overly heavy book. I honestly wasn't expecting to laugh as much as I did during this book.

Audrey's journey to recovery is a constant battle and I loved how her therapist equates it to a graph that resembles heartbeats. Audrey so desperately wants her progress to be a straight incline, but like many things in life, it is a constant battle with lots of ups and downs.

Finding Audrey is a short, but very worthwhile read.",3,"[-2.3910432322168136, -1.5409959523716537, -1.232163279384336, -1.0104509075146244, -0.9618390108718693]",-0.9618390108718693
2861,"This premise could have gone in several directions, but instead of picking one, the author embraced them all. Part of this story unfolds like a police procedural, with the twist of having forensic revivers on the investigative team, allowing the newly dead to bear witness to their own deaths. However, there are also elements of the supernatural and some old fashioned ""evil presence from beyond"" horror. And don't forget to stir in a classic government conspiracy. The publisher describes this book as ""CSI meets The Sixth Sense,"" but I might add ""and the X-Files.""

Such a mix of genres might have gone badly, but The Revivers is a great read. The story moves quickly along, with lots of action and interesting characters. The main character, Jonah, was easy to like, sympathize with, and root for. And, much to my delight, it was usually difficult to predict where the story was headed next.

The end of the book makes it obvious that there is more to this story and sets up the next book in the series. I'm looking forward to seeing where this story is going.",4,"[-2.8778714319440057, -2.319167310575313, -1.1449104659332228, -0.9620011014590953, -1.2381660956804135]",-0.9620011014590953

But she learns that Dr. Reynolds has Baby, knows what she is, and is using her for experimentation. Amys only hope is to go back to New Hope and convince Kays brother, Ken, at Fort Black to request Baby to experiment on so she can be relatively safe.

But this is not going to be an easy task. Amy picks up a couple new people along the way, a potential romantic interest, and a serial rapist/murderer that has his eyes on Amy. Oh, and don't forget the floraes, they are out hunting too.

I have to say that I love this story. The main thing I liked was the gritty reality of a collapsed society. This is one of the better versions I have ever read. Amy was great, she is trying to make it on her own but its hard and starting to get to her. My heart broke when I learned what happened to Baby but it works well with the story.

This is a young adult dystopian story that you have to read.

Elle was so happy that she was going to get to watch the Gillespie House while Mr. and Mrs. Gillespie went out of town for a bit. She wandered through all of the rooms and found some really nice antique furniture in the upstairs rooms that no one ever went into for some reason.

She found an old cemetery that had mostly Gillespie relatives in it. She started doing research on the place and found out about some of the residents that lived there years ago.

She also found out in all of her searching that there were some ghosts still lurking around the house, one good and one bad.

She made it a mission to help out the good spirit and in so doing found out an old mystery that the owners have wanted to know for about four years now. All of this turns out good in the end for everyone involved.

I loved this little ghost story, it has all of the good stuff of a creepy house with ghosts and secrets.

2580,"As an entirety, I liked this story. The authors did a great job in explaining the nature of vampires (as well as other mystical beings) and the whole mythology behind them. It was a nice twist in vampiric fiction.

However, I do have three main criticisms: (#1) I would have liked to see a more thoroughly developed relationship between Naya and Vaugh before they fell in love. (#2) Too many subplots and characters POV switches throughout the book. Made me feel bombarded. (#3) The ending. It ended rather haste.

Over all though, a lovely lovely read! I really LOVED this book and it does have potential. I will definitely be sticking it out for books two and three and the rest of the characters in R.L.

558,"dmittedly, I did not enjoy this third volume in the series as much as the first (and perhaps the second). What started out as a supernatural mystery with interesting angles on 'creatures' of mythology kind of devolved into a statement about interracial marriage and procreating. Yes, themes of the past and the mistakes we make carried over from book two. But on the whole, with a heavily pregnant main character and multiple POVs, the story lost a lot of impetus and mystery.  Ashmole 782 became a mcguffin to the vampire-witch romance.

Story: Diane and Mathew are back in the present. But mistakes from the past are catching up to them and their enemies are closing in.

For such a large book, the synopsis pretty much condenses into two sentences. The honeymoon is definitely over for Diana and Mathew and now it is more about the people in their lives than the original Ashmole 782 mystery. Indeed, though finding Ashmole 782 started the story back in book one, very little of it is really explained or discussed by book three. I wanted to know more - and to get some answers finally to those questions.

But what is explained is the change in the vampires, witches, daemons and their de-evolution. As well, we get to explore Diana's magic more as well as Mathew's family. Yes, I wish the book had stuck with two point of views (namely, Mathew and Diana's).  As well, there is a lot of science babble in this book - even more so in a series that is well known for its ability to describe everything in minutiae.

There were enough doors left open that I would not be surprised to see the series continued beyond a trilogy. Gallowglass especially makes an enticing protagonist. But at the same time, I hope it isn't a sprawling mess.

Gabe and Keisha start off as enemies fighting for family honor, but can't seem to ignore an attraction so off the charts it comes through across the phone lines.  They both get all prickly and try to deny it to themselves and to their friends, but an accidental meeting catches them both off guard and makes them face facts. They are hot for each other and it doesn't really matter who their family is or what their best intentions were.  They've had six months of foreplay bantering over the phone and it's time to get down to business, the business of stripping each other down that is.

Gabe, Keisha, Dell (Keisha's dad), and their friends are all very likable characters. The enemies to lovers plot was fun and told at just the perfect pace to keep my full attention.

I really liked Pandora, she had a sheltered and at times lacking life. Others would look at her life and tell her to stop whining, but she was lacking the very basic human contact that we all crave.

She finds that human contact with Jax even though she doesnt know if she can trust it because of the lessons taught by her childhood with a very distant father. I really liked that flaw edge that this gave Pandora, and Jax is far from perfect too. Its enjoyable to read very human characters.

This is a second chance romance with a dash of Hollywood and friends-to-lovers thrown in for good measure. Most of the story is told in the present, but there are a few chapters in the past to really help the reader understand their relationship and what happened. I don't always love this technique, but Ms. Adams did it really well in this story. The characters have a lot of complexities and vulnerabilities and I just couldn't help but love them.

When a second body has the same wounds, he knows he has a pair of serial killers on his beat. But knowing about serial killers and finding them are two different things. Especially when the killers seem to plan their strikes carefully and their escapes even more carefully. Jesse's small-town police department becomes even busier when a high school girl is gang-raped by three schoolmates. Jesse has no evidence and the rapists threaten to ruin the girl's life if she tells, but Jesse intends to bring whatever justice is possible.
Jesse's professional life is busy, but his social life is packed. He can't get over his ex-wife and she certainly won't let him. And every other woman he meets, with the possible exception of one of his fellow cops, is ready to fall directly into bed with him. Jesse is willing to do the bed thing, but he makes it clear that he's waiting to resolve things with the ex-wife--and the resolution he wants is a return to their marriage. Since their relationship seems completely sick (as confirmed by their psychologists), that isn't an especially desirable thing for the reader but it is what Jesse wants.
Robert B. Parker is an excellent writer. His characterization of Jesse Stone is strong and rings true. Jesse tries to live his life by a sharply defined set of rules--love is forever, justice is important, revenge is worth having, physical violence can solve problems or at least make things feel better, and talking too much is a big mistake. Jesse's treatment of the young rape victim is sympathetic and nicely handled.
Fans of Robert B. Parker won't be surprised by the difficult relationship Jesse maintains with his ex-wife--this is a recurring theme in Parker's fiction. Jesse knows he would be better off if he could just get over Jenn but he can't. From a reader's perspective, I certainly wish he would. The woman simply isn't good for him. Rules and ethics or not, I find Jesse less sympathetic and more pathetic because of his hopeless love affair. STONE COLD is a short novel with plenty of white space. I wish that more had been devoted to the mystery and less to Jesse's miserable love life--especially since all sorts of attractive, friendly, and relatively healthy women are lining up to spend time with him.",2,"[-1.4420652040011315, -1.1612242985810115, -0.964107040568042, -1.0045613654179906, -1.2345050049634152]",-0.964107040568042

For the first time, he begins to question the intel he received from his usual contact. Then he sees a reflection, and realizes he isn't the only one lying in wait.

Jody, a professional surfer, is regretting her decision to accept the modeling contract, but she knows her family needs the money in more ways than one. As she's in Hawaii, attending a party as required by her stupid contract, she meets the sexiest man she's ever seen. As if that wasn't enough, he then, surprisingly, saves her life. Only to tell her afterward that he was sent to kill her. *gasp*

Cruz has no idea why a hit was ordered on Jody, nor can he get in touch with his contact to ask questions. As he and Jody spend time together, Cruz appointing himself her bodyguard, they begin to investigate who is after Jody and why. And, to bring about even more questions and concerns, it seems as if Jody is somehow linked to one of the Spirit Stones Cruz and his friends and co-workers have been searching for.

Throughout all this, Cruz and Jody begin falling for one another, despite the fact that Cruz has held a personal distrust of all humans since losing his family because of one. But things aren't always as they seem, and Jody's present situation, and the danger surrounding her, may just be connected to Cruz's painful past.

Will Cruz push Jody away because of his prejudice regarding humans? Will Jody understand why he feels that way, but fight for them at the same time? Why is Jody being hunted? Can Cruz keep her safe? Will they remove the threat before it's too late? Will Cruz and Jody get their HEA? How is Silas's ex, the woman he once thought he'd loved that in turn betrayed him, connected?

One-click now and follow along as Cruz, purposefully isolated from all emotion, finds the woman that brings sunshine back into his life, causing him to bask in it. Please keep in mind that while each book in the series features a different couple, there is an overall storyline running throughout all of them.

Lacey is a broken girl, with a ruined reputation, living in the midst of an abusive relationship.  She had a happy life in Oregon until her father died and her mother completely lost it.  Her mother turned into a drunk and couldn't take care of Lacey and her little brother on her own anymore, so she moved them back to her hometown in Mississippi.  Lacey finds herself living in a rundown trailer with her evil grandmother, drunk mother and little brother with no way out in sight.  Everyone in her life just continues to disappoint her and treat her like crap.

Something traumatic happened to Lacey in high school and she's been haunted by it ever since.  She puts up with Marcus, her abusive boyfriend, because she doesn't feel like she deserves any better.  It isn't until Marcus offers her up to all his friends, that she finally walks away.  Then she meets Everett.  She's used to guys only wanting her for one thing, so he catches her off guard when he offers to help her pass the GED test.  He doesn't push her and quickly becomes a constant in her life.  Someone she can rely on.  All she expects in return is for him to be honest.  So when she finds out he's hiding the true reason why he ended up in the small town for the summer and what he did, she can't deal.

There was a lot of drama happening and the storyline wasn't the most original, but I still really enjoyed this book.  I found myself drawn to the characters.  Everett and Lacey had a strong connection and I thought some parts were really cute.  I also admired Lacey's strength and her ability to overcome everything she went through.

She keeps her marriage status but is ultimately hoist with her own petard when she falls in love with Jake and realises that he has feelings for her as well.

I loved Jake's character and the way in which he was enmeshed in the lives of the children, even as he fell in love with Jenna, knowing that as a married woman he had to avoid her.  While the story is sweet and rather emotional, I found myself questioning whether it was necessary for Jenna to hold out regarding the truth for as long as she did.  I had to put aside my own way of dealing with problems (head on) and look at it from Jenna's perspective to understand her reasoning.

In my opinion Kylie Walker did a good job of writing a suspenseful series, it kept me turning the pages. She did a good job portraying Chloe's pain and fear. She also did make me crying in a couple of the books. In my opinion Kylie Walker wrote a pretty good character in Chloe. Chloe is strong and independent.

2252,"If you are a political observer who has been puzzling over the odd demographics of the Republican vote, this is the book for you. Beginning in the era of Ronald Reagan, some voters left the Democratic party bloc vote to swing to the right.  These ""Reagan Democrats"" did so, it was commonly assumed, over social issues;the right-to-life movement, gun control legislation, and so on.

  Frank writes of the territory he knows best, the state where he grew up, ""heartland"" Kansas.  His title is a quote from an essay written by an early twentieth-century Kansas journalist, much esteemed in his time, William Allen White.

  I had been scratching my own head in wonderment over the irony that Frank describes again and again:  Why are these people--farmers, union workers, and lower middle-class working people, some of them with truly hardscrabble lives-- voting against their own interest and aligning themselves with corporations, big money, oil and banking and pharmaceutical conglomerates?  When and how did this hoodwinking of the electorate begin and how does it continue?

  Frank's analysis will surprise and enrage those on the left.

Our two-party system is to be lauded and preserved; the best way is to open up an honest dialogue, to educate people about the agendas of each party--especially the economic agendas. The Republicans have fanned the flames of social issues which cannot be quickly and satisfyingly resolved at the ballot box but are to be decided by the courts over many years. The Democrats, striving to be the party of ""inclusiveness"", have taken in zealots whose stands on social issues are distasteful to voters. The Democrats also have taken in upwardly-mobile, educated baby boomers, who are perceived by the old-time Democratic blocs to have a patronizing attitude of ""We know what is best for you,"" rather than, ""We are in this together.""

The bottom line persists: It's the party of the people v. the party of wealth and privilege.  It's time to get back to basics, time to clear away the Republican social-issue smoke screens and to unite the Democratic party on its original solidly strong base. Frank's book can help.",4,"[-1.1351553514515316, -1.3563693954953784, -1.493485254732036, -1.0268355709908585, -0.9658912145712781]",-0.9658912145712781

They're not the best I've got on hand, but I have to at least double the price to get better. These have a smooth sound with excellent stereo separation. The highs occasionally have just a hint of tinniness, but not always and not much. The bass is quite satisfying. Notes are crisp. There is some distortion (fuzziness) above about 80% volume. That's certainly not unusual in this price range, and it is above the volume I would ever normally use.

The ears are comfortably padded, and despite what I saw in one critical review, I'm wearing them now with music playing and the TV on at normal volume.

But he's only recently returned to England to assume the title after the deaths of his father and older brother who were nasty, despotic pieces of work who left him with a lot of ill-will towards his name.  Lucien understands, he's not at all sorry they are dead and gone.  His father had kicked him out many years before and he's had to make his way from poverty in Shanghai where he built his own trading company and reached prosperity--with the help of his right-hand man Merrick.

The book opens with Lucien under a super-natural attack threatening to kill him.  He and Merrick learned about magical attacks in the Far East, so they seek the English equivalent of a Shaman to aid them.  Stephen Day is such a man.  Unfortunately, he has also an axe to grind against the Vaudreys.

The action is fast-paced.  Lucien/Crane has a distinct, amusing voice that is fun to experience.  The writing has an obvious ease and assurance.  I was pleasantly surprised.  This immediately felt like a book I wanted to curl up with and enjoy.

1776,"I read the previous book and I had such high hopes for this one, as well. I was definitely not let down. This is the continuation of Sam's story, which technically began in the previous book. You get to see her very real struggles and triumphs and, even as a reader, it's a wonderful thing to witness.

Sam is probably one of my favorite heroines. She's broken, but not too broken. She's strong and real and you just want to protect her. I love that she falls for Griffin fairly easily, even if she's not really expecting or wanting this relationship to come to fruition. There wasn't a whole lot of hesitation, which makes it even more realistic. She had reservations, but this wasn't one of those books where they have no reason to deny themselves, but do. That's a surefire way to annoy me.

If Sam is one of my favorite heroines, Griffin is definitely one of my favorite heroes. He is strong and charming and just perfect for Sam. I loved him in the previous book and I loved him even more here. He has his life together, but still has his own flaws. My only complaint was that maybe he should have had a few more flaws; he was definitely at risk of being a little too perfect. I kept waiting for some big secret in his past to come crashing to the forefront, but it never did.

I absolutely loved having Everleigh and Hunter back. They played huge parts in this book and it was wonderful to get to see them together again. While their story doesn't really ""develop,"" like it did in the previous book, it does advance.

I also loved Thia. She was daring and just the perfect person to help Sam. I enjoyed learning a little more about her in the end and getting to see a different side of her. She was a good foil to Sam.

It's a nice twist that he's a little kid, not yet school age, but he essentially takes care of his mother and sister.  At the beginning of the story, he's up in the middle of the night, with milk on the stove getting warm, and making sandwiches for them to calm them from the storm.  I love the reversal of roles.

Villain is the third book in the Northbridge Nights Series by Jackie Wang. I have not read the other books in this series and was able to follow along with no difficulties. This is a dark suspenseful romance and not an easy/sweet read. Villain does have a HEA, but the path to reach it is bumpy and difficult.

In this story, Ryder is on a mission to hurt the one person he feels messed up his life. He planned perfectly how he was going to get his revenge, although he did not plan on Callista Rayner reacting the way she did. Will Ryder let go of his anger and move forward with his life or risk it all to get his retribution?

The characters are complex, well developed and the story line is gripping. It smoothly switches back and forth between the past and the present with plenty of twists and turns! I definitely recommend this book to those that like the dark suspenseful romance.

The majority of the time, young women from poor families would be sold so that the family could eat. This was the case for a young woman named Kira.

The day, in which Kira was forced by her father to participate, Kira looked for a way to escape. She timed her escape perfectly until she spotted her little brother gazing and all but drooling at the overwhelming display of foods that the auction house provided only for the auctioneer and those that were bidding. It was not for the families of the girls being auctioned off.

As it stood, Kira went for a huge amount of gold to a kind gentleman named Tom. She watched as her father offered up one of his gold coins and advanced on to the food followed by her younger siblings. She was grateful to know that the amount paid for her would likely take care of her family for a lifetime.

Kira later found out that Tom purchased her for his sons Blake and Steven. She was to sleep with the both of them until she became pregnant and then at which time she would marry the son who impregnated her. In their city, via their medically advanced technology, the father could be identified after conception.

I found the book just okay. I love shifter books but didn't really like this one. The battle for time spent with  Kira from the brothers turned me off. The whole concept of sleeping with the brothers, only to get pregnant was weird and wrong. The way she just accepted it, even yearned for it threw me off.

1269,"I enjoyed this addition to the Elvis Cole and Joe Pike collection.  This one felt a little different because the problems involved three young adults with a total lack of caring for the consequences of the crimes they were committing. Their view of what was fun was painfully innocent.  Tyson Connor's mother was worried because his behavior had changed so much recently.  When she searched his room she found a watch with a price listed in the stratosphere.  Then she found new clothes and then cash; lots and lots of cash.  She wants Elvis to follow her son to find out what he's doing.  All it took was one phone call for Elvis Cole to know there was going to be big trouble for Tyson and his friends.

This is a story filled with a lot of unusual characters so having it unfold from many points of view was a good way to present the story.  The two hitmen are actually two of the most interesting bad guys I think I've ever encountered in fiction.  Stone cold killers and very good at their job yet amazingly devoted to each other.  Those two are probably what I will remember best about this story.  Tyson's mother was also very realistically presented.  I would have wanted to wring his scrawny neck too if I had been her but she always kept sight of the fact that Tyson was an immature 17 year old boy who simply wanted to fit in somewhere, with someone.

Joe Pike doesn't have much of a part to play in this novel, more of someone to be a backup for Elvis, but it was still nice to have him in the story.

(So many UF heroines are said to be strong and then shown to be snivelling weaklings. I'm often disappointed.) I thought that the skinwalker yore was an interesting twist on a genre that is getting stale. I thought the way Beast was given a very different voice was clever. I thought the little bit of almost romantic intrigue was fun, though I have to admit that if it's not going to be fully utilised it's a bit of a waste. I liked the writing, etc.

My only complaints are that it seemed overly long and it was occasionally repetitive. We're told more than once, for example, about the requirements of mass transfer and the need for protein after a shift. All in all, this follows the UF formula pretty closely, but it's a fun addition to the genre.",3,"[-1.7411510120698648, -0.9909679111015367, -0.9717918916847332, -0.9897625029503941, -1.0170860461455125]",-0.9717918916847332

5471,"I read ""The Jew Store"" after seeing author Stella Suberman on Booktv.  I was impressed with her, as she is young looking and quick thinking into her ninth decade.
   Her story relates an unusual childhood, growing up in a small Tennessee town in the 20s and 30s where her immigrant parents ran a dry-goods business that catered to the lower income residents.  They were the only Jewish residents, occupying a unique niche in the life of the area.  Her sunny-natured, optimistic father flourished there, becoming southern in speech and outlook.  The adjustment was harder for her sensitive, traditional mother. For Stella and her older sister and brother, there was no question of adjustment, as life in Tennessee was the only life they knew,  and they were generally accepted and able to take root.
  Suberman is a wonderful writer, as one might expect for a ""retired editor"" of many years experience.  Her style is vividly descriptive, with a perfect balance of the characters'  inward and outward lives.  ""The Jew Store"" is a joy to read.

So, when I am think of Christmas romances, I think of snow, Christmas trees, the magic of the season, and that anything and everything is possible, including finding love.

The title Christmas with a Bite is a little deceiving. At least for me, it was. With the word ""Christmas"" in the title, I'm thinking I'm going to get a true Christmas romance. But in fact, this book could have taken place anytime. Yes, there's snow. Yes, Christmas is mentioned and there is a Christmas tree or two, but I just didn't get the warm and fuzzies I usually get in a Christmas story.

Mara Livingston and Connor Reece meet for the second time when a freak snowstorm causes Mara to wreck her car on a deserted road. Connor arrives just in time to save her from a hungry pack of wolves and gives her shelter throughout the storm. I will admit that a lot of the book was a read it before experience, but the book does contain surprises.

From the blurb, you know that these two have met before. But what you don't know is just how far these two actually go back. That discovery was one of my favorite parts.

Christmas with a Bite gives you the forbidden love story with Connor being a vampire and Mara being human. Patricia A. Wolf has written wonderful secondary characters. You get the possibility of a series, with a discovery found in the book. However, how that series is going to play out, I have no idea. I do know that Im looking forward to more books.

So in this story we are learning about how it was to live in Renaissance Italy in the 15th century. It is amazing how much has changed since that time period. We learn what your name may have been, to how houses looked to, what you may have worn.
We get information on how people lived then and how some people were wealthy and some were not. I think this was a bit of an eye opener for K has he got to see the different jobs so to speak within this book. Like servants had to live at the top of the house where it was the hottest part to where they only had a certain outfit to wear. We also learn about the clothing, schooling and the giant carnival.
At the end of the book is not only a glossary but information on famous people who were a part of the Renaissance along with why art was important.
I really liked the pictures that were in this book especially the one that showed how the currency looked.
I wonder what else the author will write about as far as time periods go as it is neat to learn new things that we didn't know before.

9399,"For those unfamiliar, Jesse Stone is the legendary, fictional, Police Chief in the small town of Paradise, Massachusetts, created by Robert B. Parker. The Jesse Stone franchise has spawned over a dozen novels and eight feature films. While being the first book in the series, strangely enough, Night Passage was the second movie shot, and the third one released. It seems odd, but Night Passage is more of an introduction to the character and the town. If this were a TV series, it would have been the pilot, but when you're trying to start a film franchise, you want to start it off with a film that hits harder and is more memorable, the way Stone Cold was. As for Night Passage, it introduces audiences to Jesse Stone, as he leaves L.A. a disgraced homicide detective, with an alcohol problem, coming on the heals of a divorce. Stone drives across the country in hopes of taking over the seemingly easy job of being a Chief in a small town, but he quickly learns that Paradise is not your ordinary small town. Tom Selleck stars and was the obvious choice to play Stone, because the man has been playing a cop for almost forty years! Unlike many of those other Policemen, Stone is more withdrawn and uses his experience to take care of business, so he can go home to his dog and his alcohol. Each story centers around a crime, but also has a secondary story, Night Passage is no different as Stone must deal with a homicide, and a domestic situation that has torn a family apart. Similar to the other films, they get big names to co-star and in Night Passage we get Academy Award Winner, Viola Davis, and Stephen Baldwin. These guess stars, along with deep characters, and complex stories are the difference between the Stone films and a TV series. While Jesse Stone would transfer into a tremendous TV series, you wouldn't get the same feel that you do from the films. The world of Jesse Stone is a cold, dark one. He must do his job while battle his own demons at the same time. With a perfect leading man, coming from some very well written novels, the Jesse Stone films have been a treat, and Night Passage is where it all started. I'd highly recommend getting into the series, but watch the films in order of the novels, not in the order the films were released.",3,"[-2.2564141394819694, -1.0130969591004724, -1.1353610409546697, -0.9756907235929528, -1.2460728035307735]",-0.9756907235929528

I enjoyed the mystery and it cetainly kept me guessing but at times I felt that the author wasn't quite sure which way she wanted to take this book, with side stories that tied in but just didn't seem to be needed in spots. There is plenty of description of Seattle and I would love to visit there one day from the author's obvious love of the place but directions with street names is a little much when they mean nothing to someone who has never been there. This being said, Pepper is a strong woman who loves her shop. She is helping to find out who murdered a new client especially when a friend asks for her help. The mystery kept me guessing with plenty of twists and turns and a hint of the paranormal. I enjoyed the addition of Ben and I hope that he sticks around. I will continue on with this series.

But their differences eventually divide them and the relationship ends abruptly in an explosion of meanness.  Clementine decides to have Joel removed from her memory, and seeks the assistance of Dr. Mierzqwiak (Wilkinson) and his less than professional assistants (Wood and Ruffalo).  When Joel discovers this, he decides to follow suit and remove Clementine from his mind.  But Joel's memory is a tangled place, and soon he discovers that he does not want to lose the memories that he has.  What follows is a foreword and backward journey through Joel's mind as he tries to hide his memories of Clementine from the ""erasers"".  As usual, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman has produced an offbeat movie.  Those looking for a typical Jim Carrey movie will be sorely disappointed.  If you are looking for an off the wall romance in which almost anything can happen (after all, a good portion of the movie takes place in Joel's head), you will walk away with a smile on your face and the realization that all memories are a part of who we are and should never be forgotten.",3,"[-1.4716267067344257, -1.482327211977009, -1.0582167168689802, -1.016168592803873, -0.9763214932537979]",-0.9763214932537979

The cutesy cover of her first book in this series, Loose Screw, got me interested, but it was the first class mystery that kept me hooked until I clicked the last page on my Kindle.

Lucy Matthews is a crime reporter turned antiques dealer, who one day stumbles across a body. When her ex-boss asks her to follow up the murder for a story she reluctantly agrees and ends up knee-deep in a murder investigation.

This was a really fun mystery. I could completely relate to Lucy in her love for her pets and the way they boss her around. I live in a family of two cats and one hamster and even the hamster knows I'm a pushover.

The mystery felt well plotted out and I really enjoyed the combination of Lucy and Detective Blake. I sure hope there is more romance between the two of them in later books in the series.

The thing is, the Octopus tells Spirit that they've got more in common than he knows.  Neither of them can die, for instance, but the Spirit doesn't know why.

Now he's got even more trouble.  Old flame Sand Serif (Eva Mendez) is back in town and she's in league with his nemesis to acquire relics from Olympus itself.

""The Spirit"" is shot in the noir style of director Frank Miller's successful ""Sin City.""  The dialogue is pure film noir with a whole lot of camp and cliche thrown in, some from Will Eisner's original comic book series homage from many of the B detective films you've seen through the years.

While the film was not billed as a comedy, it was hard not to laugh at the lines and situations.  Samuel L. Jackson makes a great arch-villain and his  monologueing is just classic.  Male fanboys are going to enjoy the various femme fatales in the film, including Sand Serif, Silken Floss (Scarlett Johansen), and Officer Morganstern (Stana Katic) who gives the best line in the whole film.

4316,"For a debut novel, it reads like it's been written by an author that has a few bestsellers under her belt! I was riveted to the story, and would've read it straight through, but a girl's got to get a little beauty rest.
Reagan Sommers has had a hard life, but she's a survivor. She proves that by surviving a brutal attack by four boys, injuring two of them before going down for the count.  As she's introduced to the different men who saved her life, she decides she'll never be a victim again. Anthony is the police officer that arrives at the scene of the attack and takes a personal interest in her. With Anthony she's safe, but he's looking for a relationship she can't give him. Silas & Gage own a gym together, and, along with Dexter, Gage's sweet, fun loving brother, they introduce her to the world of boxing. She discovers she's good at it, and, with Silas' encouragement, decides to enter a local match. The only problem is Gage. The more she's around him, the more attracted she is, and he draws her in like a moth to a flame.

But when she finally decides her life is heading in the right direction, tragedy strikes and she doesn't know who she should and shouldn't trust. This novel is about so much more than the world of boxing. It's gritty, rough, and gives us a glimpse into the seedy side of life. No longer knowing which direction to go, she decides to seek revenge on the ones that have hurt her the most. But will she succeed or be dragged further in to a life of darkness?

They are assigned society and cooking stories.  However Chicago in 1955 is filled with real news.  It is the heyday of corruption and politics in Chicago, with Mayor Daly in the headlines.  Coming from a long line of reporters, Jordan wants to report real news, not the latest Marilyn Monroe sighting.

It is not easy being a girl reporter in the 1950s and she struggles to prove her worth.  When she meets with an insider she gets the information on a story that just might make her boss notice her.  Jordan will do anything for a story.  Her quest to tell what is happening is palpable.  Today when I watch reporters in bullet proof vests, putting their life on the line to tell a story, I admire them, but cant begin to understand what compels them.  This book lets you see inside a reporters head.  That drive.

In addition to getting a glimpse of what it might feel like to have that reporter drive, there is also a healthy dose of Chicago history.  The corruption and the politics, the good old boys.

63,"Hilary Mantel opened her trilogy about the life and times of Thomas Cromwell with Wolf Hall, winner of the Man Booker Prize. Now it continues, seamlessly, with Bring Up the Bodies. It is to her great credit that she breathed sympathetic life into the much maligned Cromwell, who emerges in this series as a humane, decent, and capable individual who might actually be interesting to know. To read these books is to plunge into the world of Henry VIII and his courtiers, who showed remarkable courage - along with naive optimism - as they served this king in his descent into megalomania. Anyone of your colleagues in this world, where survival is the name of the game could, and probably would, become your enemy should the need arise. Thomas is a self-made man, abused by his father and determined to make his way in the world. He seems as surprised as anyone that he, the blacksmith's boy, could become privy councillor to the king. But the comments that the nobles constantly make about his humble origins do rankle. He must refer to a chart to untangle all the aristocratic family alliances, but luckily, Cromwell possesses a long, prodigious memory to bolster his drive to survive. When Henry tires of Anne Boleyn, it falls to Cromwell to bring her down to make way for Jane Seymour. Not an easy task, but Thomas must accomplish it, and who is to complain if he finds that those who had a hand in corrupting La Boleyn are also those who belittled him? It is here that Cromwell's ruthless, brutal side comes to the fore, but Anne's imprisonment and execution are treated with sympathy.

Should you choose to read Bring Up the Bodies, pay close attention to the detail in the book's first half, because it's of vast importance to the action in the second. Cromwell did what he had to, by his own lights and those of Henry VIII. We don't have to like or admire it, but to understand it is fascinating and edifying.",4,"[-1.799960369090903, -1.529075495421866, -1.3756506442929097, -1.0242022404152205, -0.9773948534955038]",-0.9773948534955038

This novel captures the life of Martin Luther and his beloved wife Katharina. The backdrop is wrought with tension as the reformation is in its early stages of sweeping across Europe. Together, this story is filled with rebellion, romance, and religious history.
While I will quickly admit that this was not one of my favorite novels by Jody Hedlund, I can't deny that it was a well developed story. There aren't many things that I have to complain about, but I think the darkness of some of the book impacted my ability to enjoy it. The book captures many of the things that were going on around the time of Martin Luther's life. The corruption within the Catholic church is quite evident in this novel.

But what I did enjoy was capturing this glimpse of a man who sparked a rebellion. A man, who without nailing is thesis to a church door, may otherwise have never been known. Martin Luther is a prominant figure in the protestant reformation and this book brings him to life in a thrilling story.

If you enjoy historical fiction, this is a wonderful read. If you enjoy romance, there is certainly a good one within it's pages. Overall, this was a very good book.

And having read more than a few of his novels, I think it is also one of his better efforts. Shaara seems to have hit his stride as a writer with this text. The dialogue (usually one of the worst aspects of his novels) is much improved in this effort. It is not brilliant, but it is better than a lot of historical fiction out there.
As usual, Shaara is best when writing scenes of battle and the firsthand experience of war from the perspective of those engaged in it. His writing enters the minds of the fighting men during such moments. There are times in this novel, especially during the first Federal attack at Vicksburg, that are simply harrowing to read.
Another highlight of the text is the characterization Shaara has utilized for William Tecumseh Sherman. He continues in this book the characterization he began in its predecessor, A Blaze of Glory, of Sherman as a man plagued by fears and doubt contrasting with the duties of war. The dichotomy of Shermans public persona and his inner turmoil really highlights his humanity and is an engaging choice.

Only a handful of humans remain, trying to stay alive and communicate with their counterparts on the one remaining hidden spaceship. The aliens have shields that have never been penetrated, unknown origins or motivations. Now they have decided to methodically exterminate the last few humans from Earth.

But its not over until its over. Luck and an accidental discovery allow the humans one last desperate attempt to fight back. Now, a daring attempt from an ace pilot and a few brave resistance fighters on Earth are all that stand between total extinction and taking back humanitys home.

This action based Sci-Fi thriller is full of ordinary heroes against overwhelming odds. Little is told about the aliens until late in the novel. It gives the listener the feeling of desperation that the survivors would feel. What possible hope could they have, after all? And it is very effective. The characters are believable and we easily empathize with them. It is also interesting that two generations have gone by since the invasion with few living witnesses to the original apocalypse. Many survivors simply want to hide and live as best they can in the ruins. Only when that option is removed do they have to join in the fight.

Jeff Hays provides an exceptional performance, exuding the overwhelming foreboding and desperation in his voice that the characters would feel. His accents and characterizations are excellent and the listener is swept up in the story. It would be difficult to imagine a better match for the novel.

Alien invasion, desperate humans, star-ships, cool weapons, exciting fight scenes and flawed heroes all combine into an extremely entertaining novel. It is clearly the first in a series of unknown length and will have the listener looking forward to the sequels. Highly recommended.

2516,This is a sweet and fun contemporary romance. There is debut nothing graphic which was a nice change of pace. Janie is awkward and endearing. Quinn is just alpha enough.

3888,"The book description calls Patricia Forde's The List ""Fahrenheit 451 meets The Giver for middle grade readers!""  That seems pretty apt.  The List is cut from the same cloth as the recent trend of teen-oriented post-apocalyptic and dystopia fiction.  While this whole genre of YA novels would point to classics like Fahrenheit 451 and The Giver as sources of inspiration, none of them measure up, including The List.

Letta, Forde's young, female heroine (most of these have young, female heroines, of course) is the assistant to the Wordsmith of Ark.  Ark was founded by an environmentalist named Noa (haha) who became frustrated when no one heeded his warnings about the rising sea level.  He established Ark, the ice caps melted, and his new city was high and dry, seemingly the last remnant of human civilization.

Noa, the authoritarian leader of the tightly controlled community of Ark, believes that language was the root of all of humanity's problems.  ""Our aim is to curtail the use of language,"" he tells Letta, who becomes the Wordsmith after her mentor disappears.  ""As you know, throwing words around is quite irresponsible, considering our history.""  His public agenda is to limit language to The List, a list of a few hundred words.  His private agenda, which Letta eventually catches wind of, is much more insidious.

The List isn't bad.  It checks all the boxes for the genre.  Noa is a caricature of the evil dictator with a charming side.  The central planning and the enforcers of societal structure are stock as well.  The List is not wholly cookie-cutter, but it was not original or well-written enough for me to love it.

.
Nine years ago a logging accident took the lives of Jess Morgan's father and her high school sweetheart.  When her mother quickly found a new man Jeff felt she betrayed her father and left Destiny Falls with no plans of ever returning.  Over the years the rift between her and her mother has become a chasm that would rival the Grand Canyon.  Then she is pulled back to Destiny Falls to take care of some family matters.  She hopes to quickly convince her mother to return with her to Toronto and perhaps finding a way to heal their relationship.

Adam Wright is an old friend of Jess' and he hopes to help her heal from the continued pain she has carried with her for the last nine years.  Adam, a forester, values family and nurturing your roots.  He wants to show Jess that facing life head on is better than hiding away and letting you pain fester can hold you back from enjoying life to its fullest.  What he fails to notice that his persistence in pushing her to face the past is pushing her away from him until she rejects him and walks away.  Now Adam must convince Jess he didn't mean to hurt her and that she is important to him as more than a friend.  He wants a future with her in his life permanently.

A touching story that pulls a reader into the story quickly.  You can sympathize with Jess, Adam and her mother especially anyone who has lost a family member themselves.  The characters are very believable. The story is well plotted and flows smoothly scene to scene.  This is a definite keep to read again and again.  My rating is 4 1/2 stars out of 5 stars.  I hope you enjoy Where She Belongs as much as I did.",4,"[-2.756152437323842, -1.64321524088904, -1.0550057740312253, -1.0165240341370474, -0.9786213386895678]",-0.9786213386895678

Even after she tears up about it, he still does not talk to her. She tries constantly to talk to him and he bad mouths her about how she does not try new things and has her high morals and crap like that that she prides herself on. Even after hearing about Trent, he still does not talk to her. She has to go basically BEG for him and she did NOTHING WRONG, it was all him and his unwillingness to listen to her for 2 seconds!!!!

2811,"In the Pursuit of Charity by Alexandria Sure  4 Stars

No act of kindness, however small, is ever wasted. ~Aesop

In the Pursuit of Charity is really Alexiss story.  She is a college student who is hoping to get an internship in her field of choice.  She has a self-confidence about her skill set, knows who she is as a person and holds her head high even when people make fun of her and call her names.  For as brave as she appears, she is also vulnerable and susceptible to peoples expectations of who she is and what she should be.  Linc is a senior at the same school and also grew up with expectations of who he should be.  They are kindred spirits in that aspect.  He is the big man on campus and surrounds himself with like-minded friends.

In the Pursuit of Charity is labeled as a prequel to a soon to be written novel.  The idea behind the story is a solid one.  It tugs on our heart strings, makes us root for the underdog, and reminds us that the world is STILL not a perfect place to grow up in.  90% of the characters in this story ticked me off.  They are selfish and shallow and vapid and superficial.  Isnt a good story supposed to evoke emotions (even unwanted emotions) in us?

As a prequel this story has a beginning and a middle and I look forward to finding out the end.  I am hopeful that the forthcoming novel focuses on Alexiss success in life and Im hopeful we get to learn more about the assistant swim coach.  Shes an intriguing character for sure.",3,"[-1.9132406236981812, -1.175437857596601, -0.9789411841185398, -1.0067543011178528, -1.4810769980148542]",-0.9789411841185398

7919,"Okay, the laptop desk, at a price under $50. What are you getting? Well, first off, it is supremely easy to assemble, so no worries there. It isn't very large at all, so depending on your needs, this could pretty much fit anywhere you need it to in your home. I bought it for my girlfriend to have something fairly small and simple for her laptop when we are in our living room. It looks pretty nice in a minimalist sort of way. So, those are the basics. The two little drawers you see in the picture...those aren't actually drawers per se. They are actually cloth bins that fit in those slots. The picture is a bit misleading in this regard. Also, i wouldnt call this desk unstable, but i wouldnt treat it too roughly either. It isn't very heavy, and i question its durability if you were to really put it to the test. The only other thing i would say is that if you are a bit larger (like me for example at 6'4"" tall), this desk is decidedly not for you. For my girlfriend who is 5'6"", the size is perfect. So, when considering this desk, take these two things into account: your size and how durable do you really need it to be.
Anyways, i don't feel like you can go wrong as long as you know what you are getting going in, so if this seems like it will work for you based on that criteria, then i definitely recommend this desk overall.
Enjoy!",3,"[-1.8270119599321617, -1.4443293854382935, -1.0390869922739716, -1.0044660226301636, -0.9789933982867214]",-0.9789933982867214

Now, I also found it unrealistic, in that a group of seven took on an almost limitless enemy organization but, well, that's part of the fun isn't it? Who doesn't love rooting for the underdog?

I though Gideon an interesting character and I liked his narrative voice quite a lot. Similarly, I liked the side characters, though I thought some of them could have been a little more fleshed out and the villainous cult they pitted themselves against could have done with a bit more depth. They felt evil for the sake of evil, instead of dedicated to a cause. All in all, however, I will happily read more of Bateman's books.",3,"[-2.570671758552885, -1.600821106168483, -0.9790310895443312, -0.9866257203080707, -0.9842451555731823]",-0.9790310895443312

9527,"This is a dialogue driven crime/serial killer drama that starts slow in the first episode but picks up speed in the next four episodes. The picture and sound quality of the dvd was fine. Like most television dramas the ending left plenty of questions in order for people to watch the next season's episodes which regrettably  may not be available for a while. I enjoyed the series and dvd.

Gillian Anderson and Jamie Dornan drive the series. They are outwardly, in many ways, the opposite of what you would expected them to be.

Anderson is a female detective who Is convinced that there is a serial killer on the lose. Her character is  cold, calculating, tough, and driven. She is not interested in having a relationship or family but picks a male detective to spend the night with based on his looks.

Dornan is a serial killer who is a grief counselor and a family man with a wife and two children. Outwardly, his character seems to care about his family and comes across as a warm, caring family man. His character shows characteristics, as the series progresses, that indicate who he really is as does Anderson's character.

This is very much dialogue driven. I loved the dialogue and the development of the two main characters.  While there is violence it is not as much as I would have expected in a series about a serial killer.

The series is only six episodes.  The ending leaves some big questions. The problem is, according to a number of sources on the web, the next season is not set to start production until January of February 2014. Since this appeared on the BBC I think it could be a while for the next season to become available to American viewers.

Lately it seems like a number of series will take six to 10 months, and on some occasions more than a year, between seasons. I don't appreciate that and it makes me think less of those who create the series.

The picture and sound quality of the dvd is very good. There is a short feature about the making of the series that is just okay.

I will be on the look out for the next season of this series and will watch it. Yet, if for some reason season two never makes it to American television I won't be overly upset. This is a good series that given time to develop could be great but I am not counting the months until season two begins.",3,"[-2.9987837511150706, -1.1765765757995785, -1.0664020095690006, -0.9791551538646186, -1.2730389925208776]",-0.9791551538646186
9424,"I grew up on Eastwood.  My parents are huge fans; they actually saw The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly in the theater 3 times when dating.  I can name every movie just off the music Eastwood was in.  When seeing the previews for this movie, I knew I'd have to have this one.  Everyone has told me this movie is no disappointment; the previews were very thrilling.  I did expect more action, however, the friendship that forms between the crotchety Walt and Thao is heartwarming.

Walt is a war veteran, very racist, unhappy, mean, and in need of a friend; someone to care about who cares about him.  When he chases the local gang off his lawn saving Thao's hide, Thao is indebted to him and begins to work for him.  Through this they become friends.  Walt's family is nothing but greedy and distant.  Walt soon saves Thao's sister from punks and instantly makes a friend out of her.

The movie is about the car but isn't.  Everyone wants that car, but only the one deserving will get it in the end.  My mother warned me the ending was not what I'd expect and boy was she right.  I knew there would be death on both sides, but I just didn't know how that would come about.  I did cry my eyeballs out at the sacrifice and the friendship shown.

This was an excellent movie, you must watch and own.  Truly an Eastwood best.  Imagine Dirty Harry old and meaner and you have Walt.  This movie is now one of my favorites, right up there with Sudden Impact, The Good The Bad and the Ugly, High Plains Drifter, Pale Rider, For a Few Dollars More, A Fistfull of Dollars, just to name a few of Eastwood's movies that will never grow old.",4,"[-1.415599080334339, -0.9792690958840917, -1.008106416376288, -1.0131718745855969, -1.2348565952243375]",-0.9792690958840917

These characters have a chance meeting and them go about their relationship 5 years later not knowing who the other is and frankly doing it kind of backwards but it totally works. The story line had the bit of crazy and dark thrown in with lots of passion,  hot sex, and some healing of emotional wounds.
Nik and Aimee have kind of an unconventional meeting and start to everything but it totally works for their story. I loved how everything between them unfolded and they heal each other. As a reader its awesome to see a character heal and become whole throughout a story. Nik is a typical sexy alpha male who is determined to keep Aimee safe.

Despite what shes had to do for money which lead her to her predicament, she is kind and caring but also feisty and not afraid to stand up for herself or someone she cares about. I really liked both of the main characters and they friends and family were wonderful as well.
The story line was a bit unique which just added to the desire to read the book. Its typically the girl that is fending off the guy, but in this book its almost always the other way around.

Good opening scene that will rope the reader in and gave a solid visual to each protagonist, paving the way to sweet book addiction.

Against the backdrop of the Second World War and the Holocaust, a major theme of the novel is death and destruction, and so the novel itself is narrated by Death, who is even himself disgusted by the horrors of the war and Holocaust.
Liesel lives with her acid tongued and abrasive foster mother Rosa Hubberman and her gentle foster father Hans Hubberman, who as an opponent of the Nazis is ostracized by his neighbours.
Liesel survives the horrors of the bombs and the witnessing of the deportations of Jews and others, through a world of books, which she steals from a variety of sources including books rescued from the great book burnings which took place across towns and cities in Germany during the Nazi regime, deserted houses and apartments, and the library in the mayors house, which she has been given access to by the mayor's wife.

She has a few friends including Rudy Steiner, a boy of her own age, who idolizes the Black American athlete Jesse Owens, and makes no attempt to hide his love from Liesel from her.
But what will bring a lump to your throat is the growing bond and affection between the young German gentile girl, Liesel, and the Jewish fist-fighter, Max Vandenburg, who is being hidden from the Nazis by Liesel's foster parents.

2122,"Christina Hardy is moving back into her grandma's old house--one that holds many memories, good and bad.  Unfortunately, the return of a serial killer who is targeting beautiful red-heads (such as Christina), Christina's hidden-until-now predilection to see ghosts and some messing with a Ouija board at her housewarming party opens the door for Christina to become haunted by the cop who was originally accused of the killings and who wants Christina to clear his name.

Jed Braden, former cop turned novel-writer and private investigator, is a distant relation of Christina's.  He's looking into the murders, concerned because one of his books was a fictionalized account that went along with everyone's belief that the cop did it--only the cop was killed and now the murders have started again.  If it's not a copy-cat, Jed wants to help clear the dead cop and his own conscience for adding to the family's pain.  And he's romantically interested in Christina--who with her red hair, is in danger until the killer is caught.

The tale is quite readable and suspenseful.  Graham is an old and sure hand at these things.  I'm not sure this is one of her best, though, since there was sparks but not much of a relationship, otherwise, between Jed and Christina.  But if mystery is what you care about, this one was pretty good.  I did figure it out before the end, which is rare for me, but it was still unusual enough to be interesting.",3,"[-3.5951004351215143, -1.3567542823133316, -1.075486002969089, -0.981157013726397, -1.0831060905003724]",-0.981157013726397

1275,"The Harvest Man, Grecian's latest Murder Squad novel, follows on the events of The Devil's Workshop.  Nevil Hammersmith is forced to figure out his new role in life while Walter Day has a houseful of people and a desk job to contend with.  Meanwhile, a killer known as the Harvest Man has Inspector Tiffany learning new ways of detecting with the help of Dr. Kingsley.  Oh, and Jack the Ripper is still out there somewhere and taunting Day.

Grecian manages to balance the main plots with the side activities deftly without dropping the ball on any of them until quite late in this Murder Squad outing.  The continuing story of the Day clan introduces some new characters to love and dislike while Hammersmith cannot quite manage to keep himself out of harm's way as usual.  The writing is on par with the previous two volumes, so if you've enjoyed them, you'll get into this one quite easily.  There are some gruesome moments spent with the Harvest Man, so beware that this book isn't sunshine and rainbows in the slightest.  Jack's continuing games with Day are more a distraction from the other plot meant to lead into the next book of which there must be one coming.  There is a conclusion of sorts, but we're definitely left with unanswered problems.

This series is one that some people love (like me) and others don't.  I recommend starting at the beginning and not with this volume (or at least starting with The Devil's Workshop) as this particular story takes cues from the previous.  It's another sometimes harrowing outing for Scotland Yard's Murder Squad and not to be missed even if sometimes things get tied up a bit tritely.  Enjoyable if a bit bloody and dark at times.

Since Feral Sins, I have been interested in Ryan's book and him finding his happy ending. I never imagined him with a mate such as her, but she is pretty awesome and fits. There were different issues in this book that kept me on the edge of my seat, waiting to see how they all resolved themselves. There were some steamy sex scenes in this book. These two were the perfect match for one another. I liked seeing the heroine mess with the Ryan. Once he was with her, we got to see a different side of him. All the secondary characters were good to see again and they helped make the story what it is; a good read. I read this story straight through, into the early morning hours, because I couldn't put it down. The heroine is an interesting and nice addition to the pack. There is of course some danger and some fighting involved in this story. The story also has some angst as well. This was another well done job by Suzanne!

2038,"I'm a little torn with this one, and I'm finding it even hard to write my review.  On the one hand I absolutely LOVED all of these characters and how Roseanna shows us where the main characters from all three books end up.  I love the mystery and the twists!  I LOVE the romance!!!  And I love some of what Roseanna did with the character Catherine.  But on the other there where things that I wanted to be different.  I had thought Rushworth would have been different than he is in this book, and on many levels I wished he had been.  And the addition of Indian religion and such did not appeal to me and I found myself skipping through those scenes.  I understand that the diamonds were from India, but I personally would have preferred a little less depth into their ""history"".  I also was left longing for something I can't quite put my finger on.  There are characters added in this book that I wanted to be wrapped up more completely, and the way things end with the diamonds wasn't what I expected, and while I'm not really sure on how I wanted it different, I just felt like it fell a bit flat.  Overall I have many favorite scenes that I could read again and again, I LOVE all of the characters, but the book as a whole leaves me missing and longing for something....  The second in this series is still my favorite and the one I recommend the most! :)

1475,"Master story teller John Lescroart's, ""Damage"" (Glitsky #3), is another exceptional read featuring his iconic characters. Mixed in with a good deal of suspense this yarn, it's jealousy, infidelity, greed, and a sense of duty dominate this plot. Newly elected D.A. Wes Farrell is jolted with his first crisis and bombshell just as his term is beginning. Roland ""Ro"" Curtlee has been released from his 25 year sentence for rape as he is granted a new trial. Ro Curtlee was a serial raper and all around really bad guy before prison. Ro would take from women when and where he felt like as a child of privilege. Ro's father Cliff Curtlee, is a big time mover and shaker in San Francisco pushes Wes for a reasonable bail. The Curtlee's were big contributors to Farrell's campaign so Wes allows Ro to get bail. Head of SFPD homicide Abe Glitsky and his team are furious. Curtlee loose in the community is a very dangerous thing. When the bodies start popping up it's looking like Ro was getting payback for his nine years locked up. All of the victims had something to do with putting Ro away in some form or another. Glitsky makes Wes realize what a terrible thing has happened allowing Ro to get bail. Wes and his top prosecutor work like crazy to get Ro back into custody. Meanwhile Glitsky who is under intense pressure from the press and mayor to keep his head and work the homicides. As with all of author John Lescroart's novels the suspense builds as the plot unfolds piece by piece. At times it was tough to not just read one more chapter then one more. Running just over 440 pages this one does run a bit too long. The unexpected conclusion was beautifully camouflaged as the murder investigations are being solved. Main characters Wes Farrell and Abe Glintsky are strong enough to carry this read with help from supporting characters. Colorful and and down to earth without being pretentious Lescroart's characters themselves are one of the best reasons for reading his novels. Four stars out of a possible five stars for, ""Damage"". Any read from author John Lescroart is destined to be enjoyable and this one doesn't disappoints either.

Amy, who was prematurely unfrozen, is trying to come to terms with life aboard the ship and misses her family and being on Earth. When it looks like they might be closer to their destination than anyone thought, she becomes excited and will do anything to get off the ship. Meanwhile Elder tries to be the best leader he can be, but was he born to lead?

I absolutely loved the first book, Across the Universe. I seem to read a lot of YA fantasy but not a lot of YA science fiction and that's part of my strong affection for this series. The other part is that the idea of leaving earth in Godspeed for another planet, hopefully a better planet, is such a fantastic idea and I've loved watching this play out.

For me, A Million Suns was even better than the first book. Across the Universe  set up the story and it really developed into a fast-paced thrilling story in A Million Suns. Through Elder and Amy we learn more about the secrets behind Godspeed and some of the secrets were definitely edge-of-the-seat earth-shattering! There were quite a few ""Oh My"" moments as I read faster and faster to the thrilling end.

I liked Elder a little less in A Million Suns. He needs to stand up and be a leader and he has to make some tough decisions, but there was something that didn't quite connect with me. However, I continue to like Amy. She's so anxious to get off Godspeed at any cost and she faces some tough decisions in this book and comes out on top.

Today, IVF and other similar methods to have a child are commonplace for couples with infertility.  Catriona and James find themselves in the throws of infertility while Diana and Liam are also struggling through infertility as well.  Postpartum depression turns into postpartum psychosis and Catriona and Sebastian are in danger of her own behaviors.  Diana has a baby using a donated egg, but the nightmare of all nightmares occurs when Noah is kidnapped in his stroller while grocery shopping with his mother.

Harry's wife has requested the her husband be admitted due to the depression he suffers from the loss of his job.

Then one day I decided I wanted to read a really good romance so I went online and googled ""Best Romance Novels"" and Voyager (Outlander Series) came up as #1. So, I thought - why not? After reading all the books in this series by Diana Gabaldon (not once but twice) I am now eagerly awaiting what is purported to be the final book, ""Written in My Own Heart's Blood.""

Other reviewers have written about the premise for this book which involves time travel for a young married woman named Clare Beauchamp Randall from the 20th century who accidentally goes back in time to the 18th century. Not knowing if she will ever return to her life in the 20th century and in order to spare her life, she must get married in the 18th century. So she marries a young man named Jamie Fraser.

What can I say that would be enough? In my opinion, Jamie Fraser is close to everything a woman would want in her mate. He is loyal, willing to give his wife freedom to be herself, selflessly sacrifices himself for those he loves, has a heart large enough to take in those who are not his blood and make them family and may God have mercy on you if you try to harm them.

The adventures Jamie and Clare go through together are absolutely amazing. The set of books in this series can be truly identified as historical. You will never again view the Scottish people in quite the same way after you go through the Battle of Culloden with them. From the court of Louis XV where the Bonny Prince Charlie was a guest to the American colonies and the American Revolution, you will be transported through time to see how the Scottish emigrants worked to make a life.

Although Jamie's and Clare's relationship began as a marriage of convenience, theirs became a life-long love affair. My favorite set of books in this genre.

I have to put a disclaimer on this review by saying that I am not a Johnny Depp fan and am really getting sick of him playing the same role over and over. Having said that this movie is deceiving. The preview made it seem like it was a comedy, while there are funny parts this is not really a straight comedy. I never saw the TV show so I wasn't sure what to expect but to me the movie had the feel of less funny ""Death Becomes Her"" as far as comedy goes. To me the best parts were the old maid who doesn't speak at all and the soundtrack (as well as Alice Cooper). There were some pretty funny lines and Depp did do a good job but this is his typical character lately so I can't really be impressed by his acting. I will admit though that if you are a Johnny Depp fan then you will probably really enjoy this movie and totally disagree with my review.

631,"Here's an interesting variation on the ""locked room"" plot. Rather than an actual room, James employs an isolated island with a limited number of suspects and a variety of motives.

Combe Island is a secure location for the powerful to seek respite. When a famed writer is found hanged in the island's lighthouse, authorities aren't certain whether it was suicide or murder.

Hoping to avoid unwanted publicity, government sidesteps the local constabulary and sends in Commander Adam Dalgliesh and his team to discretely sort out the situation.

Ever responsive to duty, Dalgliesh accepts the assignment even though it means another disruption in his ongoing courtship of Emma Lavenham.

Coping with her own emotional problems, Detective Inspector Kate Miskin is handed another as she must now supervise the ambitious and ambivalent Sergeant Francis Benton-Smith.

The team has barely begun sorting out the clues which determine the first was murder when they are confronted with a second brutal slaying. James complicate the situation further by throwing in a contagious disease that puts Dalgliesh in jeopardy and throws more responsibility on Kate. Despite his health problems, it is still AD who comes up with the solution.

As is usual in her novels, action is slowed down to allow ample opportunity for us to get to know the characters and the location. For some all the description and back story may be a distraction.

Not only did he capture Stout's voice superbly, but he created mysteries that were very bit as good as the master's

About 2/3 years ago Huzzah!) not only did the older novels come back, but Goldsborough started writing new ones that were every bit as good as they ever were

Alas, as is true of ANY writer, not every work is a gem (even Stout had his off days/books)

This latest, while still eminently readable... and surely a must for ""the Wolfe pack""... seems, for want of a better word, a bit ""tired"";

The pacing is just a wee bit slow and, frankly, the milieu of Broadway during a period of time that isn't today seems ""off"" (not to mention vaguely
not ""Wolfe-ish"")

Although Jeremy is also a psychologist, he is younger than Delaware and practices in a hospital (as opposed to Delaware's private practice).  Yes, he does become involved in a series of mysterious murders--including the murder of his own girlfriend--but unlike Delaware, Jeremy is working on his own rather than with the police.
Although this book definitely contains some similarities to the Delaware series, Kellerman has done a nice job of creating an interesting new cast of characters.  Furthermore, the use of a new protagonist has allowed him to break away from the staleness of the recent Delaware books and to return to some of the energy and intensity of his earlier works.

Ensconced within the info and jokes are some nice insights and the book ultimately becomes a metaphor for the quest for knowledge.  Some will probably object to the author mentioning his fertility problems he and his wife struggle with (it does seem like a tangent occasionally) but there is enough humor entwined in the theme to make it interesting. If a tangent works who am I to object? One of the author's gifts is the rare ability to enliven and balance a vast variety of topics.

I had to get used to the author's style, which initially I found a bit snarky, but after several pages I tuned into his vibe. I'm glad I adjusted because I ultimately enjoyed quite a few belly laughs. My favorite was the bit about his dad's favorite drink being Yellow Lightening.

While some of the involved people are nearly 80, they still wield enough power to commit murder, and their  offspring are willing to help to keep their families reputation from being brought down.

 Pros:  Iles story telling capabilities are working at full throttle.  He's one of the best out there that I've come across.

 Cons:  You could, but shouldn't start with this novel.  There are several Penn Cage novels and should should do those first because  he makes vague references to things that happened in them.  This book ends, but is not completely finished.  There are several  parts that I presume will be picked up in the next novel.

 Comments:  You get Iles' superb writing and story telling skills plus bunches of little pieces of information on how whites  view blacks and blacks view whites in the deep south.  There's some really interesting analysis on Hurricane Katrina and  the reconstruction of New Orleans (this book is set 3 months after Katrina).

Is the day Max the same as the one Alice spends her nights with though and how come they dream about each other? They need to find some answers and they need to do it quickly as a lot is at stake for both of them.

Dreamology is the sweetest story I've ever read. The beautiful cover is a great representation of the story. It's a cute love story with an amazing topic, the actual existence of your dream guy or girl. I liked that very much. Dreamology is definitely a saccharine love story, I almost expected little hearts to come out when I opened the book. The cuteness works, it's uplifting and it's a nice change from raw and deep stories that break your heart. If you're looking for something that will cheer you up Dreamology is a good choice.

Lucy Keating has written a balanced story. There are no huge ups and downs, but there's enough going on to keep the reader interested. Sometimes a story doesn't have to be a rollercoaster, it can also be fluffy clouds and rainbows. I think Max and Alice are a lovely fictional couple. They also have some wonderful friends. They're going on an adventure, nothing huge but definitely an entertaining one.

It takes place in 1799 on Dejima, a small island in Nagasaki Harbor in Japan, headquarters of the Dutch East India Trading Company, Japan's only contact with the Western world. The hero is a young Dutch clerk, Jacob De Zoet, who has come to make enough money in five years to marry his sweetheart back in Holland. With a very Dickens-like cast of characters and plot, the novel includes a flawed hero, an intelligent young woman in distress, various self-serving petty villains, and one truly monstrous evil villain, who eventually receives his just punishment. We have betrayals with long-lasting consequences and heroic sacrifices. Along the way we get a smattering of history and Japanese culture, but this is mainly an engaging story of human beings attempting to find honor and happiness, which could have taken place any time, any place.

The dust jacket says that Mitchell did ""prodigious research"" to write this book, so I presume it is historically accurate, but that is almost beside the point. The value of this book lies in its plot, which is absorbing; in its dialogue, which is so well done that each character has a different ""voice""; and in its narration, which is inventive and original. His inclusion of small descriptive sections in the form of traditional Japanese poetry was an interesting addition.

What shines is a female character who holds her own and is an equal to any of the guys. But somewhat sloppy world building and underdeveloped characters left me wanting a bit more from the series.

Story: Meadow has had a hard life: brought up by her tough as nails father to be prepared to fight and survive, her family barely gets by (the 3 siblings are near starvation) in a post apocalyptic walled Florida city where murders are rampant. Zephyr is an orphan, a ward of the city, and the lowest of the lowest caste. He and friend Talan spend the day cleaning up the dead bodies off the streets and taking them to the crematorium. When their paths cross, it will set off a chain of events that will endanger not only their lives, but the lives of the people from whom they care. Especially when they discover the Murder Complex.

The story moves at a brisk pace. At times, it feels like world and character do suffer as a result. Meadow is a strong fighter and survivor but we never really get a distinct impression of her personality. Zephyr, on the other hand, is morose and suicidal but we never learn why until nearly the end of the book.

Despite the somewhat flat protagonists and milieu, I enjoyed reading the Murder Complex. It may not have the nuances and depth of a Hunger Games but the gritty hopelessness of the world coupled with some interesting twists and surprises kept me reading.

The is a great Summer read - easy to follow but with dark edges. I am looking forward to the second in the series.

Waking Hours has a little of everything - strange phenomena, a chilling murder, a touch of the supernatural, and a pair who met in high school and are reconnecting. Dani Harris shared a dance with Tommy Gunderson in high school. She was bookish and quiet and he was a football star. The relationship went nowhere in high school. They meet again later in life under circumstances that bring them to the heart of a grisly murder. Dani, turned psychiatrist and is working on consult for the police department and Tommy, retired from pro football, harbors an interest in becoming a PI. Dani and Tommy end up investigating a crime that defies logic. Wiehl doesn't go through gratuitous violence here, which was a relief. Thus begins our journey with Dani and Tommy into a life-changing investigation.

Told in third person, the story is limited to the thoughts and feelings of just Dani and Tommy, which enhanced the mystery. You are kept guessing who committed the murder at the start of the story. The whole story is veiled in the supernatural. I couldn't wait to finish this story, just couldn't wait to see what was going to come next. The story was complete on its own, but did leave a couple strands of the story untied, likely for a book two in this series. I look forward to book two, not just to tie up loose ends, but to continue an adventure with characters who are so well created and well rounded that I can't wait to read more.",4,"[-1.929027517190015, -1.6096524617558492, -1.030113419059278, -0.9864975067198835, -1.3781070410773486]",-0.9864975067198835

3045,"From the first page, Honor drew me in. In a contradiction to her name, Honor is viewed quite disfavorably by the society in which she grows up, prompting her to move to a new area. There it seems that everything that could leave her further destitute will happen. With every page and every event, this novel moved beyond my expectations.

The characters in this novel are extremely well developed. The emotions that Honor and Samuel have for each other feel quite realistic given each of the situations that they find themselves in. Each time one of them reacted with anger or frustration, I could relate because in my mind, I would react the same way.

As independent characters, Honor and Samuel definitely have their own passions driving them. For Honor it is her strong desire to actively work to free slaves. For Samuel, it is to maintain his privacy and not be the focus of peoples attention because of his inability to hear. Sometimes their passions help their budding feelings for one another, and at other times, like a good book should, those passions create tension and problems. But I enjoyed seeing their relationships develop.

I was blown away by the way Samuel came across on the pages. To write dialogue for him, there had to be constant references of signing and gesturing. Lyn Cote made sure to never let the reader forget that Samuel was deaf. But these dialogue tags never became redundant but rather added to the mental movie screen playing in my mind.

With every chapter, Lyn Cote included many scenes that would have taken up the bulk of many other novels. However, she used these scenes to develop tension in the story and further the development of characters. I had a hard time putting this novel down, and at one point was surprised (and disappointed because it was so good) that I found my self over halfway through the book.

If you enjoy novels with abolition as part of the storyline, novels that have characters who identify as Quakers, or just a good love story, I would suggest you consider reading Honor by Lyn Cote.

It is the true story of a murder of a young woman, whose body was found in a well. Suspicion then focused on a young man who lived in the same boarding house as the woman, and things don't look too good for him.

 Enter the defense team of Alexander Hamilton, Aaron Burr, and another well known local lawyer. Wow, the reader thinks, those two working together! Remember that at that time New York City was not very large or populous, and in courts the same small group of attorneys met each other and contended with each other, sometime on one side of a matter, and sometime on the other side of another matter.

 Hamilton and Burr make an excellent defense team, as each has particular skills that complement the skills of the other. The reason this case is still known is that it was the first case in the country where the proceedings were taken down in a form of shorthand and later published for all to read..

 As an attorney myself, I found the trial fascinating, not only for what happened, but for how the criminal justice system differed then from how we approach it now. The author builds up the suspense until the verdict is reached. After that, there is a short coda about the famous Hamilton - Burr duel, and a reciting of what happened to many of the key players in this matter.

It was sad that Vale needed to break free from Hawke to become a better person.  She needed  to break the chains .

Garrison is in Seattle trying to find a job after being Uganda to dig wells for fresh water. While there, he contracts malaria and is still trying to recover from this when he gets word that his beloved Grandmother has died. He returns to his childhood home in Vancouver to wrap things up for his grandmother and deal with the cats she has left behind.

It's not as easy as it sounds, though, because his grandmother left behind very specific instructions of how the cats are to be placed. Lots of hoops for someone to jump through in order to own a cat and Garrison is realizing it may not be as easy as he thought. Part of the problem is that Garrison is allergic to the cats he now finds himself living with until he finds them new homes.

Such a cute story with a romantic storyline on the side. I was rooting for the cats and for Garrison to find happiness and love. I liked how we follow along with Garrison as he learns new things about himself, his grandmother and the cats. I really loved this story and it's exactly what a Christmas book should be!

3984,"4.25 stars-- POCKETFUL OF SAND is the latest romantic, contemporary, adult storyline from author M. Leighton. This is former pro football star Cole Danzer and single mother Eden Taylors storyline.

Told from alternating first person points of view (Eden and Cole) the focus of the storyline is the building relationship between two people who believe they are broken beyond repair. Both with painful, heartbreaking backstories that have all but destroyed each of their lives, our hero and heroine have struggled with haunting memories, grief and guilt.

Eden and her daughter Emmy are new to Millers Pond-a shy, quiet seaside town of 2000 inhabitants. On the run, Eden is determined to keep Emmy safe and protected. Meeting Cole Danzer was never in the cards but Eden is drawn to the reclusive, former football player whose heart and soul are shattered by the past. Cole wants nothing to do with relationships or love but meeting Eden gives Cole a hope for the future.

The secondary and supporting characters include some of the people from Millers Pond including brother and sister duo Jordan and Jason Bailey as well as a few regulars at the local restaurant and caf.

We are privy to Eden and Coles histories through reflection and memory-each relating their experiences and nightmares about the past and the present. Eden is determined to keep Emmy safe while Cole is determined never again to lose his heart.

4782,"Book Review: Warranted Pleasures
Author: Shannon Nemechek
FIVE STARS
Shannon Nemechek is writing a military romance in this book.  A Cheif Warrant officer and a Non-Commissioned officer meet during an investigation and yes it is supposed to be against military rules for them to have a relationship, but is that going to stop Raleigh from pursuing  Samantha?
This was not my first military romance, I love wounded warrior romances and all romances that have to do with the military and the heros of this world finding their loves.  The sexual tension between Raleigh and Samantha is very high as they try to keep each other at arms length distance.  Raleigh wants Samantha, yet Samantha doesn't just want to be another notch in his bed post.
Full of mystery and intrigue.  The details and the militay talk throughout the book let you know that either Shannon Nemechek has been around military or she has thoroughly researched this.  Either way it was very well done.
This book has it all.  Mystery, romance, steamy sex, and a happily ever after.  This is the first book in the series, Warranted, and I hope to read the others as soon as they come out.

195,"Alex Dryden is apparently the pseudonym of a journalist with long experience covering Russia--15 years in the country--and security matters. Though it's not clear what the point of the pen name is since his picture is posted online and a set of cover blurbs from Steven Fry, Hugh Laurie and Emma Thompson--all of whom were in Footlights Theater at Cambridge--suggests a certain commonality of background. At any rate, Whoever he is in real life, the author must have felt his non-fiction dispatches were being ignored, because Red to Black is essentially an anti-Putin polemic cast in the guise of a novel. And a pretty good one at that.

Finn is an MI6 agent in Russia with a very useful mole in the government. Anna, the youngest female colonel in the KGB, is offered up as a honey trap. But the two fall in love and over a period of years work to expose The Plan, a long term effort by members of the Russian security services to achieve by more capitalistic and acquisitive means the subversion of Europe that the USSR so spectacularly failed at. Dryden portrays a Russia on the march, using its energy resources to triumph over a recumbent Western Europe. Anyone familiar with Russia's own demographic crisis will find it even harder to take the bear seriously now than we did twenty years ago, but the analysis of why the USSR fell and what Putin and company would like to achieve is lucid and compelling. It's a fair warning, if perhaps an overblown one.",3,"[-2.0195790026556044, -1.7291079128003695, -1.0786932834902425, -0.9884854716644562, -1.3106657571088327]",-0.9884854716644562

6976,"Wow! I have never read a Lauren Blakely book I didn't enjoy immensely. Theo and April were such a well matched couple. April has a family reunion to go to and she is tired of her family always trying to set her up with a man as well as trying to get her to move back to her hometown. What's a woman to do? Well, seems Theo is able to offer his services as a boyfriend for hire. What starts out as a way for April not to have to deal with what appears to be her meddling family; soon turns into something more than just a boyfriend for hire when the two start falling for one another. In true Lauren Blakely style this a a wonderful rom com, with a bit of a cameo from a character mention from another of her fabulous books. You will have to read the book to find out who it is. I really enjoyed the way April and Theo bounced stories of their romance off one another when coming up with a background story for her family of how they met. I rally liked how those stories seemed to fuel the fire of the feelings they had for one another. Even though they knew that what they originally agreed upon neither could seem to help the bit of jealousy they felt at times. I found that so sweet. This is a really well written story and the ending was just perfect. wonderful HEA.

161,"I was at first intimidated by The Rift's size, and the fact that Williams is basically an unknown author. I didn't know if Willimas and the story could hold my intrigue and attention for 900+ pages. The good news is that Walter J. Williams is a really good story teller, and despite what some of the other reveiwers have stated, he does a great job of character development. The science mixed in with the story is well done, and enhances the story quite well. I don't want to spoil any plot points by giving away who survives the terrifying earthquake, or what they encounter afterwared, so I will just state, that if you like disaster stories, you will enjoy The Rift. The series of disasters hitting the Midwest and deep-South is even more terrifying in the fact the Williams' disasters, the quakes, actually occured at the turn of the 19th Century.

The are a couple reasons I only rate the book with 3 stars though. The social commentary, specifically the racial tensions in the novel are pretty heavy-handed and preachy. And the last 3rd of the novel focuses more on the would be race-war, than on the quakes, and other disasters looming on the Mississippi.

Williams also has you invest time in some interesting characters, such as a Park Ranger working the St. Louis Arch, who after following her through some harrowing experiences is forgotten by the author. The same can be said for the many pages devoted to the devious stockbroker, and though we learn of his fate, his whole storyline just sort of peters out without a satisfying conclusion. And the final drawback to the novel is the excerpts and accounts of the 1811 quakes the begin each chapter. After about one third of the novel, these excerpts begin to repeat the same information over and over. After reading half the novel, I just began skipping them. There was really no need to insert so many old accounts of the previous quakes that did not further the current story in the novel.

So overall, there was quite a bit in The Rift that should have been left on the editing room floor.

But saying all of that, I would still recommend you give this entertaining book a shot and I will be sure to read the next book I see by this author.",2,"[-4.432315175343943, -1.6211069403066003, -1.1194043670703182, -1.034829765168425, -0.9892025287366712]",-0.9892025287366712
3512,"What better setting for a romance than Paris! In Marc Levys P.S. From Paris friendship and love bloom. With the aid of friends, the main characters, Paul and Mia, meet, flirt until they're friends, and eventually fall in love.

Paul is an expatriate from the U.S.A., and Mia is an English actress on the run from her philandering husband. The misdirection and miscommunication that is their first meeting is humorous, and it is acrimonious enough that you're sure they will never see each other again. However, fate brings them together again and again. As the story progresses, the author provides generous detail about Pauls circumstances and Mias predicament. While some of the plot points felt contrived, it does allow for Mia and Paul to learn to take risks/leaps of faith.

Paul is an endearing character. His fear of flying and avoidance of publicity is quirky and charming. His Italian editor, Cristoneli, is hilarious; his butchering of the English language made me laugh aloud. Mia is adorable and empathetic. Her best friend, Daisy, brings balance to Mias chaos. Daisy is a superb character! I loved how all these characters meld together.

This charming, utterly romantic story is near perfect. The one thing that detracted from that perfection was the twist in Pauls tale at the end because it felt like a preachy political message from a celebrity. The twist however, did give Paul a reason to get out of his head, get over his infatuation, and get on with his life. Overall, P.S. From Paris is a lovely, quick-paced romance.

The venue is an elegant country inn run by a former classmate, and the guests, with a few exceptions, are also alumni and old friends. Author Shreve's plot is a simple one, though complex to tell. Their reunion after twenty five years opens up a lot of baggage that contains items not in the clothing category. During the wedding weekend, each of the seven principal characters undergoes a personal crisis of conscience. Their current encounters with each other, their school memories, and their ensuing choices are told and retold from their own perspectives, giving the reader glimpses into how their collective past affected their individual futures. Each crisis is of the sort that we all experience at one time or another. Each classmate goes home a changed person.

A Wedding in December is beautifully written but slow paced and introspective. Characters are nicely developed into people we can easily relate to.

""""Dark Matter"" delivers another scenario that involves a plot that sets the action in a different and certainly not ordinary setting.
  Jason Dessen is a physics professor at a local university very happily married to Daniela, a woman that he has been in love with since meeting her years ago.  They have a son named Charles who is an adolescent to be proud of.  That Jason turned down a career involved with making brilliant strides in the world of physics in order to marry Daniela when she became pregnant does not enter his mind.
  One evening while preparing for a family meal Jason is called out to have a drink with a long time friend of his.  He leaves the bar shortly after the drink but is stopped at gunpoint by a stranger, taken to a warehouse and put to sleep.  He awakens strapped to a gurney and told by a person he does not know ""welcome back my friend.  He learns that he seemingly is a different Jason Dessen, one who has achieved something so far beyond what he has ever known that he will become world famous.

This the 12th book in the Longmire series and as always, Craig Johnson has delivered a well written mystery involving many of the recurring characters in the series. Walt Longmire gets a call from a friend, Campbell County Sheriff's Deputy Corbin Dougherty. Dougherty wants Walt to help him investigate a motorcycle accident that has left the motorcyclist in a coma and unlikely to ever recover. Walt is renowned throughout the state of Wyoming as one the best investigators the state has. He is the Sheriff of fictional Absaroka County
As Walt starts to ask questions, he soon realizes that there are some major criminal activities going on.
Some of the characters:
Walt's friend, Henry Standing Bear, who came to participate in the annual Sturgis motorcycle rally.
Victoria Moretti, Walt's undersheriff.
Lola, an old girlfriend of Henry's. He named his car Lola. Walt's granddaughter is named Lola, after the car. Lola is the mother of the injured motorcyclist.
Robert Nance, local rich guy, and father of the witness who reported the motorcycle accident.

I liked the way the story went back and forth between humorous exchanges between the characters and the building mystery.

As well as the older woman, younger man issues, Cora has an almost ex-husband that you just know is going to be a source of trouble. Cora and Bran's first meeting was also meant to be their last, at least as far as Cora was concerned. Life and Bran have different plans, and boy some of those plans are a little kinky and a LOT steamy. Wowsers this pair have enough chemistry to melt your kindle.

They both keep secrets from each other which inevitably come and bite them on them on their 'arse'. I love that these books are set in Australia, with their almost British vocabulary. Although at times I wanted to shake Cora, I also totally got her reasoning. In fact this was one of the things I loved about the book, actions/decisions that you knew were stupid (""Oh that's so going to blow up in your face"" stuff) were well explained/reasoned away.

I can't put my finger on why I loved this story so much, or what exactly it was that captivated me. What I do know is that I totally LOVED this book, I virtually read it in one go, not wanting to put it down.

Reading A Lady in Defiance was like going back in time to the days when I watched ""Westerns"" on black and white television with my family. Those were good old days! During that era people watched those programs without concern for the outlaws, drunks, gunfights and loose women with low-cut gowns and heavy makeup. They were just good old television shows that we all knew were not indicative of our lives. They were entertainment! We didn't take them seriously. At the same time, reading Heather's book left me with those same feelings of past Westerns.

Varied characters created a depth of humanity and acceptance of the differences in individuals. All types of characters were represented in honest and down-to-earth techniques. This novel is very descriptive and incited many emotions as the story moved along, at a fast pace with no room for boredom.

I enjoyed all aspects of this novel. There is an earthy, authentic, coarseness to the community of Defiance. This is definitely a good versus evil kind of book that kept my attention right through to the end. I highly recommend A Lady in Defiance, and look forward to the sequel!

59,"Once in a great while an author comes along who writes such beautiful, elegant prose that it hardly matters if the plot of the book is at all interesting. When the story being told is also insightful and intriguing, the gift being given to the reader is beyond price. Thank you, Joseph O'Neill, for this wonderful novel.

In its relatively few pages (around 250, at a time when so many authors are so long-winded), Netherland includes an examination of love and loss, a vivid look at the New York City not seen by tourists, the exuberant and somewhat tragic story of one man's pursuit of the American dream, and much discussion of the game of cricket.

The plot: Hans van den Broek from Holland is a stock analyst working in London when he learns of the murder of an American man who was once his friend. He remembers the time when he was living in New York City and his wife took their small son and returned to her parents' home in England in the aftermath of 9/11. Lonely and adrift, Hans found some solace in playing cricket, the game of his youth, with immigrant Americans from countries where cricket is loved. He formed an unlikely friendship with Chuck Ramkissoon, a charismatic Trinidadian who introduced him to a different New York City from the one he had known.

O'Neill effortlessly and seamlessly moves between scenes from his youth, from his time in America, and his present in England. His Ramkissoon character has unmistakeable echoes of The Great Gatsby, but one has no sense that this is a ""rip off,"" more of a homage perhaps. The ending is impressive. I would give it 5 stars, but I try to reserve that for books which are, or should become, classics. The subject matter here is perhaps too esoteric for that. But otherwise....",3,"[-4.0319231877706025, -2.1397687352217787, -1.5169072302335327, -0.9913793711621455, -0.9978823389309612]",-0.9913793711621455

With a little introduction to set the stage, the book opens with a passenger jet crash.  The reader knows (or can assume) it has something to do with one of the characters from the introduction.  After the crash, the NTSB assembles a Go Team to investigate.  The first person on the crash scene is technically not part of the team because he quit after an unsuccessful investigation.  (The unsuccessful investigation gets mentioned by a number of different people on the Go Team.  I found the repetition a bit tedious.)  The Go Team ultimately has seven different people, each with a different specialty.

Interwoven in the investigation is a parallel plot involving an FBI agent, his (possibly) flaky informant, and a group of Irish terrorists.

With the number of people on the Go Team and the Irish terrorist side plot, I found the story a bit busy and near the end the ""crashers"" did some things that pushed my ability to suspend disbelief a little farther than necessary.  Telling what it was would spoil the story for people who have a greater ability to suspend disbelief, but you will recognize it when it gets there.

5492,"Meg Wolitzer tackles one of the questions that has been a source of debate for a generation now:  why do women make the individual choices that they do? What -- if anything -- do women gain and lose by becoming stay-at-home moms?  How does a woman find value in an age that defines her worth by her paycheck and her status in the working world?

In browsing through other reviews of this book, it seems as if this debate is live and well.  Some passionately defend choices of stay-at-home moms;  others not so much. And that's clearly the point:  the answer is as individual as the woman herself. On becoming a mother, a woman often needs to tackle her love of her child with her desire to ""be someone"" more than a mom. There is no ""right"" answer.

The women in this novel -- Amy, Jill, Roberta, Karen, and Penny -- are all fully-developed (some more than others) in their quest for defining themselves in lives very different from those they were brought up to expect.  The author uses an interesting device -- incorporating four or five page ""fill"" stories of their moms between chapters. To me, those stories rang less true; it is too easy, I think, to present feminist struggles when, in reality, most women of that generation sort of ""fell into"" their new roles rather than becoming aggressively involved in defining them.

Some of the conclusions -- no spoilers -- such as the story of Jill and her adopted daughter were a little too unrealistic for me; the challenge Jill faces is not so neatly wrapped up in real life.

Susan Elia MacNeal takes on both of these challenges and comes Smilin' Through (I know, ""wrong"" war. If you don't get it, ask Grandma/da)
In what is the first of what one hopes (no pun intended) will be a long-running series about Maggie Hope, American in London c. 1940, she creates a marvelous fictitious character to go with the marvelous ALMOST fictitious character of Winston C. in a tale that looks, feels,sounds, SMELLS, like wartime England.
Add to this a corker of a murder mystery and you've got something that can rival ""Foyle's War"" at its best, not to mention (although the publishers insist on it) the highest achievements of Jacqueline Winspear.

She's like the female version of Russell Crowe (and just about as hot).  Anyways, this review is not about Diane, but about Under the Tuscan Sun.  The film was not what I expected.

3.5 stars
M/M Biker, Romance
I was given this book for an honest review by Inked Rainbow Reads.

This is the second book in this series and despite my enjoying the story, I did not like it as much as the first installation of this series.

Greg is a nerdy, computer genius who has developed a relationship with Snake.  (I use Snake, because the two MC names are too similar when read together.  Greg and Gene - when reading them so close together, they look too similar, so that was another sticking point for me.)  Greg's past relationships have not ended well - he is uncomfortable with who he is.  Despite his big brain and methodical way of working, he knows that he is not the most fit person.  His shell is cracked by Snake - a rough, tough biker, undercover who's only contact is with Greg.  I really liked watching Greg come out of his shell.  He seemed to almost blossom with Snake.

Snake is a character from the previous book.  I like him much more in this story - he's less grumpy.  He's still his crass self, but Greg softens him a lot.  His demeanor changes throughout this story, mainly because of the mystery that they are trying to solve.  He has a take charge personality, but doesn't impose on Greg too much - only when they are in the bedroom or on the phone.

I wish that we would have had more phone and dirty talk - it seemed that they hinted at it, but it was never full blown in the story.  Their chemistry was great - the sex was both necessary and entertaining.

The secondary characters were plentiful.  It was sometimes hard to keep track of who was who - which made the story somewhat cumbersome.  I didn't mind the timeline chapters in the first book, but in this one I found them kind of hard to follow.  I think this would have been more powerful and less confusing had it just been written without the dates.

The mystery was also somewhat strange and even though it was wrapped up nicely, it seemed a little anticlimactic.

This was a decent story, but not my favorite by Jessie.",3,"[-2.002302766942151, -1.789141943900053, -1.0073762837882079, -0.9930363701281907, -1.0444250781141373]",-0.9930363701281907

Whilst Brayden is juggling his career on the ice, his grief and supporting his injured sister, Kara is dealing with a cheating, violent ex. When Brayden sets his sights on something, he won't stop until he's got it and Kara is in his sights. Romantic and sweet gestures abound throughout his wooing but also down and dirty in the bedroom too.

I found the time lapses and lengths annoying as it pulled me out of the story and threw me back in. It felt jarred and a bit forced and not as smooth as the first in this series. Overall not a bad way to spend a couple of hours.

2093,"Durst has created an amazing alternate world where you have to throw out your disbelief & just accept that anything is possible.  The Lost is a unique fairy tale about finding what you have lost & then you get to move on.  The town of Lost is fascinating as it consists only of lost people & lost things.  These things can be anything from a sandwich to an ocean.  If you want to learn exactly how you could lose an ocean, you'll have to read the book.  For the main character, Lauren she is not only lost, but she is ""interesting"" aka different from the other residents of Lost.  Her difference makes her story that much more well, interesting!  Lauren's life outside of Lost was so painfully real that it brought tears to my eyes.  The combination of reality & fairy tale smoothly come together creating a wildly imaginative story filled with love, hope & loss.

Overall I was thrilled with this book & planned on giving it a 5 star review, that is until I got to the end.  I warn you now, she leaves a huge cliffhanger.  I put the book down once finished & repeatedly said, ""That's it?""  If you want to find out what happens next you have to wait for Durst's next book 'The Missing'.  While I have no issues with book series & enjoy many of them, they tend to leave the reader wanting more but not leaving them hanging as brutally as Durst has done.

2627,"Jack dreaded each day of school knowing he would receive endless taunts from the ""macho"" bullies as he had since early grade school after his Dad had simply left. His mother did the best she could working long hours as w waitress in their small town's diner. She just was never there to see that Jack got off in time to catch the bus and to do any chores or laundry. The one good reason to attend class was the new girl in school...beautiful, shy, quiet and unresponsive to friendly gestures by the other students. Jack did have a few other friends but his main objective was to get the new girl, Anna's, attention. Little did he know what events would evolve from there! His reality was about to completely change! Remarkably, his video skills were going to be put to the test!

This was a very fast paced story with a solid build up, great, creative character development, action, adventure and extreme reality! The scenes were portrayed well and more than adequately visualized. The Literary skills ad imagination was superb! However, I feel it was too graphically violent for most of the younger audience it was written for.

Along with the violent action & Zombies, there was a little romance, intrigue and a lot of humor. Additionally, a few positive messages were given to inspire youth.

The Book Title was perfect. Although very eye-catching to the ""browser"" I felt the boy on the cover was too comically portrayed associated with the hero in the story. Jack was a developing teenager and somewhat ""geeky"" but hopefully not that awkwardly unappealing. (Personally, I found him very endearing and pictured as somewhat attractive)

Recommended for youth ages 13 +.

2116,"I'll began by expressing how much I have admired Woods as an author throughout the years as her stories are always enriched in happiness, in love and of course within the bonds of friendships. Yet, I feel like I am ready for some new material or at least a new series beyond the shores of Chesapeake.

As a reader who has enjoyed most of what this series has offered I was disappointed by this story. I felt like Carrie as the lead character did not fit when comparing her to fellow heroines of the past. She seemed more distant and unlike her family, perhaps even uptight. I found myself unable to relate to her as I did the other characters and I'm not so certain that even at this point that I liked her character all that much.

 The same can be not said for Sam, the hero of the story. To my surprise he did pair well with Carrie and he was well written. I enjoyed Sam's company above the other characters. He was handsome with a sense of humor and someone that I could see living within the boundaries of the story and he alone made the romance far more interesting.

 I'm certainly not the biggest fan of this book within the series. I feel like as a reader that as a series continue book after book the stories tend to lose some value and are not as strongly written as the early books and yet I will always consider Woods to be an outstanding writer. However I would love to see something a little different the next time I select a book penned by the author.

Eugene Levy is the patriarch, Johnny Rose. He is a self made man earning millions, until he lost everything. His wife, Moira, played by Cathetine O'Hara was an actress appearing in soaps, and she is actually very funny. Down on their luck, with their two children, Alexis, played by Anne Murphy, and her brother David, played by Dan Levy. Alexis is the play child,who follows her mother's fancy of 'things'. They all mean a lot, name brands and all. Dan, appears to also live Things, but he is much more reasonable. So, here they are living in a small motel, Schitt's Creek.

Storylines come and go, but always with humor and good manners. Johnny is a very reasonable man, thankful for everyone, and trying to figure out what happened to their lives. The rest of the family tags along, hoping for a change. Humor us well placed, but there is always a serious side to the issues. Certainly a play on words, but fun to observe.

Sharn Macer is a 9th grade English teacher elected to be the faculty adviser for an after-school baseball program for at risk students. Keefer Smith is the baseball coach assigned to train Sharns students.  Sharn and Keefer know each other from their own high school days, but back then they ran in different circles. Now they aren't so different though. Their family backgrounds bear a lot of similarities, even when they don't realize it.

Overall the story is good. I enjoyed the inclusion of the students. Sharn and Keefer make a cute couple and in the small moments where they act like a couple they have a lot of potential. Unfortunately, there are also missed opportunities for romance in place of which there is a distinct lack of communication between two professional college graduates, which made it frustrating at times. I liked both of their characters; I just really wanted to see them show some more maturity in the way they handled a potential relationship. And I really wanted more steam! ;-) There is a serious lack of hot, detailed encounters here.

If you like Sophie Kinsella and the characters she creates, you'll definitely enjoy this novel by Michele Gorman.

The story follows Hannah as she arrives in London, friendless, jobless, manless and completely out of her element. The reader gets a front row seat as she makes new friends, treds the choppy dating waters and begins a career as an assistant party planner. Hannah is so funny and, in my opinion, completely relatable. She is, all at once, awkward, snarky, bold, resourceful, klumsy, witty and vulnerable.

I really enjoyed this book which, in addition to being a very funny read, taught me a lot about the cultural differences between the U.S. and London. The secondary characters were also very believable and added to my enjoyment of the story. My only complaint was that Hannah's hard fall for her love interest seemed to come out of nowhere.

1474,"When a young man is found dead in his apartment, the cause of death is listed as a weak heart. However, the diagnosis doesn't make sense to surgeon Paul Gibson, who has the man's body dug up and taken to his offices. It's while examining the remains that Gibson discovers that the man in question, Alexander Ross, didn't die from heart trouble. He was murdered.

Gibson contacts his friend, Viscount Sebastian St Cyr, a man-about-town who has a reputation for getting involved in solving murders. Sebastian is immediately on the job, trying to find out what Ross was up to (he worked for the Foreign Office, dealing primarily with diplomats), who he had contact with (a Russian colonel, two Americans, a Turkish ambassador's wife, and a French book dealer), and why anyone would want him dead (motive unknown). However, when the body of an American is discovered a few days later, and the murders took place the same night with the same MO, Sebastian can't let things rest. Does London have a serial killer on his hands? What could the link between a young Englishman and a man from Baltimore be? And when the bodies of his suspects start piling up, he is left with even less to go on.

""Where Shadows Dance"" is the sixth installment of C.S. Harris' Sebastian St Cyr mystery series. This one takes place about a week after the conclusion of ""What Remains of Heaven"", and deals with several character arcs that took place not only in that book but in its predecessors.

Gavin and Ally had a friendship for years before it fell apart as teens. Neither was brave enough to take the love they feel for each other to the next level and allowed a jealous third party to get between them.
But when Ally goes back home and ""wins"" Gavin in a charity bachelor, they have the chance to rekindle their old friendship and maybe build it into something new, if only they're brave enough.
I really liked the chemistry between Ally and Gavin and the glimpses of their past friendship. I'm a sucker for wedding stories, too, so the backdrop of a destination wedding was just icing on the cake, no pun intended!
Even though this is presented as book four in the series, I didn't feel like I was missing anything by not reading the others first. I'll be going back for those, though. If they are even half as good as Jeannie Moon's book, they'll be great, too!

279,"I love a good family drama, especially with Brits! Add a hefty dash of British humor and I'm all in.  ""The Past"", by Tessa Hadley, is a thoroughly entertaining and addicting story of a family of middle-aged siblings as they reunite for a three-week summer vacation in their grandparent's old and crumbling country manse. We have frivolous Alice and her ex-boyfriend's son, Kasim, orderly oldest daughter Harriet, solid Fran, the youngest and her two delightfully written children Ivy and Arthur. Then there is brother Roland and his new (third) wife Pilar, and his daughter Molly to round out the house party. At first I found Alice to be irritatingly scattered, but by the end I had an entirely different opinion of her. In fact, my feelings for all of the characters changed as the story unfolded.

I'm the oldest of five and so I  can easily identify with (and enjoy!) all the Sturm und Drang of sibling relationships, which just intensified my enjoyment of this novel. In addition, Hadley's prose is gorgeous; her luscious descriptions of the bucolic setting, and shambling old house, brought me right into the setting.

""The Past"" is the kind of novel that illustrates the importance of novels in our lives. There is real value in reading about a character's inner monologue. Hadley is extremely gifted at writing about what her characters are thinking about. The importance for us is that reading about what others think, and why, helps us to gain insight and understanding of the world and the people in it. In striving to understand our fellow human beings, we gain so much: sympathy, empathy, understanding, even sometimes disdain and revulsion.

However, quotes are indicated with leading dashes...it's still difficult and distracting to read, but it's better than nothing (marginally). Despite that, I highly recommend this enthralling and well-paced tale.",4,"[-2.923771938927866, -2.1534804299975923, -1.4402000273377014, -0.9956099006572887, -1.0201942723997093]",-0.9956099006572887

M/M Romance
Triggers: Accident involving death and coma, constant medical neurological condition
I was given this book for an honest review by Wicked Reads.

Hmmm, this was my first introduction to Aicher's style.  I liked it fairly well.

Grady is just all kinds of mysterious.  I like how he is loyal to his friends, family and job, however, he is so complicated at times that he almost seemed immature.  While I can understand why he was so upset by the accident, especially one that almost cost him his only family connection, he also was so back and forth about what he wanted, how he was feeling that I got whiplash at times.

Then you have Micah.  Yum.  While he has his own story, his own complicated history, he was my favorite character in this story.  He was the rock that the water rushed around, but he was never moving.

The two characters have pretty good chemistry - they have a kink that compliments each other and they also have the ability to just be friends too, which I think, strengthens their bond.

While I was somewhat annoyed at the back and forth of the characters' feelings and desires, in the end, the story resulted in a relatively well wrapped package.

It is no wonder she has a hard time accepting her father's family after finding out she has been lied to and manipulated her entire life by her mother's family. She has a terrible temper and is very sarcastic, but that's only her ""tough as nails"" exterior, inside there is a world of hurt and pain. That facade does get a little old at times as she cannot seem to have a conversation without being snarky, but it is somewhat understandable as it is her version of ""armor"" to protect herself. As the book goes on, she starts to show more of her true feeling underneath.

Even though there wasn't any real progress in a relationship between Adam and Sabina, I felt more of a potential between them than in the prior book. Unfortunately, it is only a potential at this point, he was absent for too much of the book for anything to happen. Despite his absence, Sabina starts to allow herself to feel something for him and realizes at this point in her life, he is the only person she trusts to any extent. I hope in future books we get to see more of them actually together.

The mage's treatment of her irked me. If Sabina is supposed to be this ""chosen"" one, why does everyone seem to blow her off and act like she is an imbecile because she has lived differently than them. You would think if they believe she is that important, the mages would want to listen to her, so their dismissing behavior does not make sense to me. She does seem to gain some respect as the book goes on, but it just isn't enough in my opinion. She's either important to them, or she isn't. They cannot expect her to be this ""chosen"" one without their complete support.

1859,"Cisco Suarez wakes up in a dumpster after being killed 10 years ago. He remembers none of the last decade, how he died, or how he got many of the skills and strength he now has. After tracking down a couple of friends, he is able to piece together enough details to follow a trail toward his killers. More questions arise as he finds out someone slaughtered his family and a Hattian voodoo gang wants him dead.

The action continues non-stop throughout the story, voodoo, necromancy, the occult, potions, and more fill the tale with magical violence. The story is written in the first person, so the listener is inside Ciscos head throughout; reliving his fears, insecurities, slowly returning memories and newly discovered abilities. He is a self-taught necromancer and wielder of magic, so most of his skills are sometimes a surprise to him.

As the listener rediscovers Ciscos lost 10 years, we relive his emotions with him, lost friendships, family, and lover. It gets claustrophobic and redundant at times but remains generally entertaining. The plot is less about making sense than following Ciscos stumbling luck as an amateur occult detective.

Neil Hellegers performs the story well, giving it a personality. His voice gets into the listeners head as he becomes Cisco. A solid performance that is pleasant to listen to and gets out of the way when the action gets hot.

Dead Man is a detective story wrapped in the shell of magic and the occult. There are enough dead bodies, zombies, and wizards to fill a small stadium. Strange that the non-magic people don't seem to notice much of it. Never mind, thats not the point. It is Ciscos world and you are invited to share it intimately as you ride on his shoulder. While there is plenty of violence and most of it horrific, it is cartoonish and won't give you nightmares. The story is entertaining enough, fast paced and inventive. Listen to the sample, it will give you enough to decide if the style is your taste.

2905,"I was given an electronic copy by St. Martin's Press and NetGalley, in exchange for an honest review.

Having not read the novels that are the previous installments in the Lucy Kincaid series, I was definitely felt like something was missing.  The rich background of the established characters, that which the whole series is based, is not really explained during No Good Deed.  That being said, this book is well paced and thrilling from beginning to end.  Author Allison Brennan has created a complete world with a very realistic view of the criminal element in society.  FBI Agent Lucy Kincaid is intelligent and strong, both mentally and physically, with a good head on her shoulders.

Simon West and Grace Bell met and quickly realized they needed each other. She's an event planner and he's a financial fixer. She was going through an issue with a local senator and it was affecting her business in a bad way and by reputation, she knew only Simon West could help her. When Simon met Grace he realized she was an ex-girlfriend of the man he hates and wants to bring down. What happens when two single people start spending tremendous amounts of time together?

Exactly!

You should recognize Simon from book one in the Billionaire's in the City series, Teaching the Boss. He was on a mission then and it continues in this book. I would have liked more heat between the two main characters. Simon was almost single-minded about taking down Mark DuFord and the romance felt like an afterthought. Don't get me wrong, the storyline was still great, well-written and with strong characters. Mallory Crowe is a very talented author and I can't wait for book 3.

After all, it reads virtually as a handbook for how to detect whether your criminal organization has been infiltrated by a possible cop.  (Be very suspicious if he's never around for something majorly illegal, make sure you have seen him doing something majorly illegal, etc.)

It's nice, I suppose, that all those violent criminals went to jail -- at least for a time -- but most of them are out now and, if recent news reports are to be believed, their outlaw motorcycle gang is stronger than ever.  I must assume this was made possible in part to their having carefully read this book, to avoid such mistakes in the future.

It would be one thing if the author were bragging about taking down an enemy platoon in World War II or something.  But motorcycle gangs are still a serious problem, and, in the end, this book's priority seems to be glorifying the courage of the author.  Meanwhile, criminals only stand to be helped by it.

The circular kibbles are small and of a nice size for my small dog to eat. The first two listed ingredients are lamb and chicken meal, followed by chickpeas and split peas, which appear to be the good source of the 32% high protein content. Furthermore, I like that it has no grain, corn or wheat fillers, which don't fill her up are just gonna make her poop more.

I transitioned her into her new food over a couple of days by slowly and increasingly replacing her old kibbles with the new ones. She doesn't seem to have a digestive problem with the new food. So far so good. This food claims to have a lower glycemic content but I haven't noticed anything different in my dog. So I'm not sure how it works out benefit wise.

629,"There is much of the familiar in Anne Tyler's latest novel, ""Digging to America""; endearing characters, the bustle and flow of family life, and the small wonders of the quotidian world, but much is new here as well. For one thing, the protagonist Maryam is a most unusual ""Tyler woman"". She is small, compact and spare, elegant and soft spoken. She holds herself in and thinks before she speaks. She doesn't trail scarves, tissues and hairpins the way many of Tyler's women do. She's not prescient Justine from ""Searching for Caleb"", nor scatter-brained Maggie from ""Breathing Lessons"", nor a caretaker like Rebecca from ""Back When We Were Grownups"". And Maryam's ""difference"" is purposefully apt, for she is a foreigner. This novel, about two families who become intertwined when they both adopt Korean girls, explores the notions of fitting in, what it means to be ""different"", of what it is to be an ""American"", of what must be lost of the self to join a community. (This last point is amusingly illustrated in an attempt to coerce a tiny Chinese girl into giving up her pacifier.)

Readers familiar with Tyler's work will not be surprised to find that September 11th is given but a glancing swipe. After all, Tyler skimmed past WWII and the Vietnam war in her last novel ""The Amateur Marriage""!  The outside world does not affect Tyler's landscape the way family does. Ever.

This insightful tale of culture clash and will delight all Tyler fans. One can't help but assume that much of this story is autobiographical given that Tyler's late husband was from Iran. That certainly adds credibility to the characters. Also, the candid conversation two characters have about losing a spouse rings very true.

940,"CIA researcher Tess Bailey longs to get into the field but is continually denied the chance. When she overhears that an agent's cover may be blown, she contacts his partner, Jimmy Nash, and includes herself in the rescue. She does a good job but even that doesn't win her the promotion--it does win her a one-night-stand with Nash, though, and she's wanted Nash for a long time.
Frustrated at the CIA's unwillingness to let her into the field, Bailey quits and joins Troubleshooters Incorporated, a private company run by ex-Navy Seals who take on the jobs the government won't do. There she finds herself on a team with Nash, his partner, and several other ex-Seals, Marines, and ex-CIA agents--being sent to Kazbekistan--a Moslem failed state whose warlords are reputed to have close ties to Al-Qaeda. An earthquake has created a humanitarian disaster serious enough to force Kazbekistan to open its borders for the first time in years--and killed the local Al-Qaeda leader. The man may be dead, but his laptop computer, equipped with all of Al-Qaeda's plans for terrorist plots, is still at large.
In Kazbekistan, Bailey and Nash confront the attraction that neither wants but neither can deny. Somehow, between dodging aftershocks, heading off a noisy newspaper reporter, setting up illegal broadcast towers, and chasing down every CIA contact left in the country, they make time for passion. But passion comes with its own price--especially as Nash comes to realize that his partner has fallen for Bailey too.
Throw in a beautiful American whose husband was beheaded by the local dictator and a daring rescue in the fortress-like headquarters of the local warlord and you have an exciting romantic adventure.
Author Suzanne Brockmann does an excellent job characterizing the damaged Jimmy Nash and setting him up for redemption at the hands of the first woman who can actually understand and respect him for who he is. I was impressed as well by the way Brockmann dealt with the Moslem resentment against an America which seems more intent on punishing than on understanding and helping--not supporting the attitude, of course, but understanding it.

5842,"Had I not read the previous books from this author...Rook & Ronin's story; Ford, Spencer, Merc & Sasha's stories; I would've defined James Fenici as a creepy, obsessive stalker.  But now that I know these people, I realize James is acting normal.  He's doing what comes naturally.  He's tall, dark and deadly....he's an assassin and specializes in poison; he's a pharmacology genius.  His only purpose in life is to eliminate his target(s).  He's focused, aggressive, calculating and intelligent.  He never fails.  And he's been derailed by Harper Tate.  He's been following her...watching & stalking her for months.  He's obsessed with her....but Harper isn't the type to befriend anyone.

She's a quiet girl.  She listens rather than talks...pays attention rather than interrupts.  Harper Tate has long sun bleached blond hair and warm amber eyes.  She's stunning with her heart shaped face and golden bronzed tan.  She was born into The Company....a cult-like militia/compound in the back-country of Wyoming and Nebraska, that trains their children to be killers and worse. It's a secret organization that indoctrinates their children with propaganda.  Harper, however, was raised with her twin brother on a Yacht all of their eighteen years.  Rather than be forced into marriage, she escapes and is on the run...hiding.  And when James Fenici enters her life, she does what comes naturally...she runs.  But Harper is so alone and lonely and James doesn't get discouraged easily.  He's persistent in his obsession of her.  They eventually befriend one another.

This novella lays a wonderful foundation of the personalities of Harper and James.  But frankly, I like Harper best when she wasn't interested in James.  I liked her disinterest of him.  She's strong and independent and relies on herself for her survival and those traits draw me.  But she's so incredibly lonely that she eventually gravitates to James' friendliness and succumbs to his many charms.  A brilliant beginning to this romantic/suspenseful trilogy.",4,"[-2.13247103985854, -1.3230202205716586, -1.1519873044781699, -0.9986054076106645, -1.1487814023602994]",-0.9986054076106645
2227,"THE HIRED MAN tells the tale of Duro Kolak, a lifelong resident of Gost,  Croatia.  He works as a freelance handy-person. His stoic, simple life changes radically when an English family, Laura, Matt, and Grace, buys a neighbor's house to use as a vacation home.  Laura's husband stays behind to attend to business, so Duro helps the new family -- and earns some much-needed money in the process.  As Duro helps with repairs, he and Grace uncover and restore a lovely mosaic found at the front of the home.

The Croatian villagers, for the most part, seem rather grim and clannish; they don't take too well at all to the new family coming in.  Because of this, there are times when relationships between Duro and his old friends become even more fragile.  This novel is written in first person from Duro's point of view, and sometimes he says outright that he doesn't like a particular person anymore.

The setting, to me, was particularly intriguing.  About seventeen years ago I taught English to people who came to the U.S. from Bosnia and Croatia, and I wanted to learn more about what that part of Europe and its people are like.

An unhappy betrothal which led to the death of her fianc has turned her totally against the whole idea of marriage.  Her sister's unhappy marriage to the handsome Earl of Maxwell has only strengthened her feeling that marriage is not for her.  She receives a letter from Uncle Josiah - the Duke of Weybridge - inviting her to what he believes to be his last birthday party.

Lady Emily, Lady Isabel and their brother Lucian and their father the Earl of Chiswick gather at Josiah's castle and find they are expected to meet Gavin Waring the Duke's heir who has grown up in America and is a stranger to all of them.  What follows is a light hearted Regency romp with some sparky dialogue and some interesting characters.  I particularly liked Benson, Gavin's valet, who is very much a Jeeves character and an excellent ally in what becomes almost a French farce at times.  The Duke himself is very well done too and I liked Lady Emily.

Aleksei and Kate's story is a quick fun read.  The transformation of the characters from the beginning of the story to the end was very satisfying.  Both had their insecurities and vulnerabilities, but grew from them due to the other person giving them what they truly needed.  It was a beautiful hinge to read as Aleksei grew to love and see how important Kate was to him.  And it was nice to see Kate mature, get a little self-confidence and go for what she wanted.  There was a little drama, but neither shied away from it and worked it out.  Very nicely done.

Air tight and light tight rooms, Tyler only leaving the house at night.  But the strain has gotten worse as Tyler has gotten older.  Now his sister is acting out, his dad works out of town, and Eve has just about reached her limit.  When a tragedy occurs, the very existence of this family's situation is held in delicate balance.

This book?  Explosive.  This is not just your run of the mill thriller.  I mean, sure, there is the typical aspects of a thriller, with a crime being committed and consequently covered up.  But the aspect of Tyler's rare medical condition literally casts shade over the entire story.  And as we all know, everything looks spookier in the shadows.

I thought the character development was superb in this story.  Eve and Tyler have a very complex relationship, one that totally dominates the family situation.  Eve really tugs on your heartstrings, you see the desperation in her, the extreme love she feels for her son.  And Tyler is absolutely smothered, between his condition and her love.

I particularly like the aspect of the book that details Tyler's nighttime treks around the community.  In the dark, Tyler sees that everyone has secrets, and he alone is privy to them.  It makes the book so much more interesting, knowing that there are layers upon layers of mystery.  It made this one of the most intriguing thrillers I have read in years.

Any attempt to describe the story with any depth might ruin some of the twists and turns that make reading it such a pleasure.  So, without betraying anything, I can tell you that the novel is loosely about a real magician, Carter the Great, whose performance President Harding attended the day he died.  Anything more about the story would deprive you of some of the joy that you will derive from reading it.  However, what I can tell you is that with the covers of this well researched novel you will encounter any number of real historical characters as well as a variety of details about life in San Francisco at the turn of the century.

She goes to the ranch for safety not realizing that the men whom she had a wild one night stand with a year before are there.

Lee, Archer, and Sutton are very much alpha males- dominant, possessive, sexy, and caring. Cricket is sweet, kind and very beautiful. Their story goes into twists and turns.

Rather than a legal case depicting the adversarial process, this is a fresh plot that just also has legal implications for the characters. There are two stories in this novel which are unrelated except to the extent that it permits the introduction of Charleston Story. She sets the stage for a moral and legal dilemma because of her roots. This will put all those she loves in the cross hairs of mobsters. The other story is reminiscent of Grisham's A Time to Kill. While interesting, their is little in the way of depth of character in that thread. It could have ben a novel on its own.

Instead of a detailed analysis of Montaigne's philosophy this is largely a review of the historical context in which Montaigne wrote. There are quotes from his epic series of essays as well but generally the author rephrases his main points. I thought the portrait the author paints of the era (roughy from 1550 to 1600) was very interesting and well written. She describes Montaigne as the first modern man and after reflection on his work I tend to agree with her.

In addition to the historical information I also got a get glimpse into Montaigne's life which was quite interesting as he lived during a succession of religious wars.

We learn along with Eve who she is and what has happened to her. Like many other suspense/mystery novels I read, I had an idea of who the killer was, but I couldn't be sure.

7079,"Rune is a bit of an oddball, sporting purple hair and packing lots of snark. Working at the video store isn't usually exciting, but when she stumbles into the scene of a murder, she cant let it go. The old man was a friend of hers and shes sure that the video he kept renting over and over again ties into a crime committed many years ago. She dives head first into danger to avenge her friend.

Being a fan of Deavers darker, brooding thrillers like The Bone Collector, this lighter mystery caught me by surprise. Not that Deaver doesnt throw in his usual curve balls to keep you off balance so the mystery eludes you til the end.

And I couldn't have asked for a more delightful character than Rune. For a twenty-year-old, shes fiercely independent and definitely not a wall flower. Throw in some more quirky people that join her in her endeavors and you get the fun character driven part of the story.

While this felt a bit different than his other writing, being an earlier work, I was glad I listened to it. And now I want to get to the rest of the series. Im curious what our purple haired gal is going to get into next.

I saw the effect on my health when I ate too much grain; with a small dog with some obvious autoimmune disorders and not too much of an appetite, it seemed like a good idea to give him better quality, more nutritionally dense, and less irritating (grain/gluten free).

1261,"It is London in 1889.  Crime is rampant, and Scotland Yard is disgraced because the investigators failed to capture Jack the Ripper.  Twelve detectives , known as the Murder Squad, have files on thousands of murders each month.

The Murder Squad has a forensic pathologist on their side - Dr. Kingsley.  He is in the forefront in this field, discovering many things we now take for granted.

One of their own is brutally murdered - his eyes and mouth sewn shut with black thread and a tailor's needle, and the body dismembered and placed in a trunk.  At that point, a detective named Walter Day is hired to take over the case.  He is on the trail, and another investigator is murdered in the same manner.

Who is doing this?  Why? Readers learn this fairly quickly, but the Murder Squad is still sorting it out.  Though readers don't have the fun of trying to figure out who is doing this, we do see how the Murder Squad is trying to solve this case, using the skills available over a century ago - and the detectives are involved in several other good plot threads as well - dealings with prostitutes, a boy found dead in a chimney, a woman unhappy in her marriage.

This was a good, suspenseful first novel.  Even though readers do know ""whodunit"" in the major part of the plot thread quickly, it was interesting to see the detectives try to solve the case.  The setting and imagery are well-written; readers can see in their minds where everything is happening and with whom. The characters, for the most part, are clearly-drawn, though two of the Scotland Yard officers have names that are a little too similar to keep straight in quick pleasure-pace reading.  One fault I find in the style is the occasional use of twenty-first century colloquialisms such as ""suss it out"" in a late nineteenth century setting.  As with many historical novels, I would've liked to see some back matter showing that the author did do research for accuracy; he does admit in the acknowledgements that this is ""a Victorian London novel written by some guy in the American Midwest.""

Even with the faults I point out, however, I still give this novel a good, strong four-star rating.",3,"[-2.5117140367614583, -1.4549283179069983, -1.0545753018303674, -1.00027518597275, -1.0079824916712474]",-1.00027518597275

930,"""The Vampire Lestat"" can be at times present ideas that are thrilling and intriguing, and it is brave in a way that it challenges boundaries, upturns genres, and destroys conventions.  Anne Rice cleverly uses the vampire genre to explore the ideas of love and alienation.  What's convenient about the vampire genre is that vampires cannot have sex, and thus vampires can achieve a purity of love, without the lust that blinds.  Lestat the protagonist spends decades searching for pure love, and he defines pure love as understanding, empathy, and companionship.  And as a vampire he discovers that the search for pure love is ultimately unfulfilled, and can only promise one day that he'll be driven into madness.  Once turned into a vampire, the man Lestat lusts for becomes quickly undone by his own powers, and the mother that Lestat longs for abandons him for safaris.

The movie ""Interview with a Vampire"" starring Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise was only bearable for its campiness, and you have to give credit to Anne Rice for boldly making fun of herself and her characters.  But reading ""The Vampire Lestat"" we discover to our horror that the opposite is in fact true.  She is in fact in love with her characters, and she sees the world entirely through them.  And that's ultimately what makes ""The Vampire Lestat"" despites its impressive literary pretensions and tremendous geographic and historical scope such an unappealing and unfulfilled read:  At the end of the day, Lestat is no more than a pompous and bombastic boor.

Also, there's no plot and the entire vampire genre is lame and stupid.",2,"[-1.49622068814096, -1.340092140796966, -1.0941203325237885, -1.0003911509066465, -1.0109321569643657]",-1.0003911509066465

224,"This final installment in Gaelen Foleys Inferno Club series was one of my favorites. Nick is hero in need of redemption. Hes made some pretty bad choices, nearly skirting into villain territory in his efforts to break free of the Order. But as the story begins, he is paying the price for his actions in a jail cell.

He is expecting an extended stay, but after just six months, he is offered a chance at freedom. All he has to do is help a beautiful woman on a spy mission. Making matters even more interesting, the lady Virginia is actually the secret daughter of Nicks late mentor Virgil.

Though she is now a widow in her 30s, Virginia has nursed a crush on Nick since her teens. Though they never met, she saw him as a girl and her father shared stories of him over the years. It was enough to make him the benchmark against which she measured other men. She enlists his help as much for him as for herself.

I really enjoyed watching Nicks interactions with Virginia change how he saw himself and what he wanted for his future. After he turned his back on the Order, he lost respect for himself. He was unable to acknowledge his own sacrifices and heroism. But as a relationship grows with Virginia, he slowly becomes whole for the first time in his life.

The spy mission is pretty good. And the adventure moves the story along. I liked Virginia, though it always leads to Bad Things when the heroine keeps secrets from the hero. Its a frustrating exercise for readers to have to watch the inevitable disaster play out, but at least the author didn't milk it overly long.

I liked the infusion of Virginias teenage son into the story. Not only does he show another side of his mom, but it makes the family dynamic so satisfying in the end. I also enjoyed the romance overall, which had far more external conflicts than internal ones.

A good conclusion to the series.

For real is a sweet romance based around the premise of ""virgin-pushed-to-lose-her-v card- by-bossy-friends""

Shannon is a college junior and shock of shock, she is a virgin.  This does not sit well with her friends who drag her out to hook up with a random guy to ""do it"".

I like Shannon.  Yes, she is a bit of a doormat when it comes to her friends, but she is smart and witty.

A chance meeting with Jett sets her on a course she never expected.

After her friends piss her off when they are out one night, she runs into Jett and a plan to get her friends off her back comes to fruition - she spends the night with him, and even though nothing happens, they tell the friends they had sex.

Jett has had the same kind of pressure from his best friend and room mate Javier, so this plan is perfect for both of them.

From the start I could tell where the story was going to go with Shannon and Jett, but watching it all unfold was a joy

I really didn't take to Shannon's friends, especially Hazel.  In fact I found her to be a bit of a bitch, and I wanted to slap her at times, and then shake Shannon to tell her to wake up to herself.  Though I did get the pom poms out when she finally stood up to them and gave them the big screw you!

Jett's roommate and best friend was also not what I expected.  After his first lot of antics, I was all ""you're a douchebag"" but as the story continued my opinion of him did a complete 180, and he was a better friend to Shannon than her own were.

This was a quick read, and I very much liked Ms Cameron's writing style.  The thing was though, just as it was getting right in and juicy, the story ended.  It was all travelling along then BAM  the end!

1206,"The Fire Wish is a light and fluffy younger-skewing YA read - a ""Parent Trap"" for YA fantasy readers. Although there is nothing new in the plot, the interesting setting does add much appeal to the novel. But very simplistic language, characters, and writing can be frustrating to more seasoned readers.

Story:  Najwa is a Jinni - a race of beings that live underground and can cast wishes. Ayele is human - the daughter of a local tribal leader.  Both the humans and Jinni are locked in a war from sixteen years earlier.  When Ayele learns she is to go to Baghdad to marry the Caliph's son, she is bereft. But a chance encounter with Najwa, and using the human's ability to force one wish out of a Jinni, she finds herself trading lives with Najwa- the Jinni now off to marry the Caliph's son and the human spirited down into the caves to live with the Jinni. They will have to fool both societies - and at the same time discover the true secret behind the Jinni war.

The setting and mythology were quite wonderful and a breath of fresh air in the YA genre. I could only wish that the author had better writing chops to really make this story come alive.  It's the difference between driving through an amazing location in a 1974 Ford Pinto or a brand new BMW.  Both will get you to the destination but the experience will be much richer in one than the other. Clumsy, repetitive sentence structures, two dimensional characters, and unconvincing dialogue made this an uncomfortable ride.

That said, it is very easy to read and follow due to the simplicity of the writing.

Jack Dalton was trouble, Holliday Hughes knew it the moment she laid eyes on him. He was sinfully sexy, mysterious and charming. The attraction was almost instant, and the chemistry was exploding all over the place. It was supposed to be one night only, and everything would just have to remain in Vegas, but Jack thought otherwise.

Her world turned a sudden 180, which left her off-balance for the onslaught of this man into her life. He was a force to be reckon with  he can be demanding, sweet, charming, vulnerable, and volatile. He kept on surprising me each time I turned the pages. I would hate him, then I would love him again. I would swoon for him, then I would think he didn't deserve any of Hollidays time. But he would make grand gestures that would be so sweet, you cant help but forgive him. Question is, until when?

 This girl is a self-made person. She started from scratch, and her work suddenly became a sensation. She didn't need a man to back her up. She made it on her own, and for that she already had my admiration. But you do not chose who you fall for. Somewhere along the way, she fell, and her life was never the same again. She didn't know it at first. She wasn't prepared for it. She was in love with a rock star.

Their love story is a roller coaster ride you wouldnt want to miss. The ups and downs were pretty much addicting you think you know whats coming, and suddenly something surprises that will leave you off-guard. There was never a boring moment in this book  some pages will infuriate you, some will make you fall in love, others will make you squirm, and each pages will have you hooked youll never want to put this down until you reach the end page.

This book is a deep gothic thriller that offers deep psychological profiling of character and plot.  The story here will grab you from the beginning and never let up.  We have a family the Fletchers who have purchased inexpensive land in Heptonclough, England that is located between two churches, the old and the new.  They have built their own home and are excited about their new life.  Sadly they are not welcomed with open arms and icy greetings come from the townspeople.  Luckily there is a new vicar for the newly opening church Harry with whom they quickly develop a bond.  There is also the town psychiatrist Evi who develops a romantic attachment with Harry and a professional/personal bond with the Fletchers.

Right from the beginning son Tom seems to be seeing a young girl who is causing trouble and calling to him.  No one else sees the girl and worry over Tom's health becomes a concern.  But even more troubling is that someone seems to want to kidnap the youngest child Millie.  The attempted kidnapping brings up its connection to other young girls who have disappeared over the years.  And add in the very troubled Gillian who was the mother of one of these other girls and the cast of fully detailed characters is set.  Ms. Bolton does an amazing job here.  She is an excellent writer and does not just rely on plot or dialogue.  She superbly establishes the atmosphere and feeling of Heptonclough.  Throughout the story the atmosphere is so truly told it is a character in itself.  But the true main characters - the Fletchers, Evi and Harry are beautifully rendered to pull the story along.  Each one is very believable and are fully developed.  None is perfect and each has their own personal demons.  These are characters we can care for and root for.  And the plot - wow - the plot develops from page one and the suspense never ends as the story builds until the very satisfying ending.

With some books characters are what holds the story together.  With others plot.  Here we get both of these things but they are in the hands of a talented, intelligent writer so everything is raised a bar.  It is a treat to enter the world S.J. Bolton has created.

It is my background that I relate wholely to this book.  As a foreign born new immigrant, I see myself in Ashimi and Ashok, trying mightily to adapt to the new culture and country.  As I became more Americanized over the past 30 years in the US, I see myself in Gogol, unsure about mother culture and American culture and where I stand in all these.

Seeing Maxim, her parents, and their life in Manhattan, I totally got Gogol's sentiment.  It is as foreing as it gets for me coming from a completely different family life and structure.  The friends of Moushumi, as seen from Gogol's point of view, also resonates strongly in me because I have the same sense of ridiculousness if I was Gogol being among those clueless cultural elitists.  Chinese people are seldom bothered by those ""issues"" and topics embraced by those hipsters.

Now in old middle age, I have finally found peace.  Like Gogol, the mother culture will always be a part of me and there's no conflict with the adapted culture.  I am proud to be both Chinese and American.  America is more home, as Ashimi had realized after decades of American life.

The series takes place in period between World Wars, a time of great change for the British Isles and virtually everywhere. Many men went to war and many were traumatized by the experience. It's a more realistic picture than Downtown Abbey, thought the action takes place around the same time frame.

Todd maintains a lively pace with a plot that is plausible, yet takes the reader through many twists and turns. The book held my interest completely - it was hard to put down. The main character, Inspector Rutledge, is likeable and complex. The style reminds me of the Maisie Dobbs series, which also takes place in this era. Maisie operates in a unique role, especially for a woman; Rutledge is a better than average Scotland Yard detective in a traditional role.

It's fun to enjoy the period piece. Some villages were not on the phone at all, and of course cell phones hadn't been invented. With no television, people amused themselves. And with a lower crime rate, you could still roam around after dark ... most of the time.

4052,"Been a while since I read it but I still remember it and that's always a good sign, at least in my book it is. That means that I liked it and there may be a chance I'm going to re-read in the future.

I liked Bronagh, she's blunt and she's in-your-face. No beating around the bush with her. Though there was a scene where I didn't know whether to be on her side or Dom's.

And speaking of Dom. I should have hated him. He had all the traits I usually detest at a hero, at a guy. Well, that didn't happen and imagine my surprise! But I guess that only means the author did a pretty good job of making him be loved and redeemed, at the end of it.

The story in a nutshell: Dom and his brothers - 4 more Slater hunks - move to Ireland and he becomes Bronagh's bully but he falls for her and boy, it takes a lot for Bronagh to give in. That's another thing I liked. Not insta-love. Book or not, I find that hard to believe.

There's more to come with the rest of the Slater hotties getting their books. 4 stars. Pretty good for a debut novel. Yes, I recommend it but head the warning.

3558,"The rewinders are a group of scholars who go back in time to verify the lineage of the 21st Century British aristocracy who pay for the service. In this reality, the American Revolution never occurred and all is British and bleak. The rewinders must only observe the past and never risk changing anything. Obviously, thats what happens.

Rewinder is a generally good twist on the much used themes of alternate history and time travel. The historical references and detail ring true and give the story weight.  Within the time travel elements, there are plenty of paradoxes and self-duplications. Battles just explains them away as thats just what happens when you time travel and they don't matter.  It does make you think about the difficulty of it all, that even a small change could affect everything.

The story is written in the first person, present tense, so you are inside the main characters head the whole time. This can get claustrophobic at times. Other times it gets tedious, as he enters our time and explains what we call phones and cars. Uh, we know what a car is.

Narration by Vicas Adams, who does an adequate job. His voice has a specific tone and quality that took this listener some getting used to. It is recommended that you listen to the audio sample and decide if this is a deal breaker. The production quality is excellent and he is certainly a professional.

Rewinder is not ground breaking, but is a pleasant listen. At about the length of a cross country plane flight and back, it is easy to stay with it.

3221,"Run to You is the first book in the Risking it All series after a prequel short story, Rock with You --though the couple from that one is in this story briefly, it's not necessary to have already read their book to enjoy this one. It takes place in the small town of Haven, North Carolina, where we are introduced to Ethan Hunter and his best friends and business partners, Ryan Blake and Mark Dalton, the soon-to-be owners of Off-the-Grid Adventures.

Ethan and Gabby, a software designer who has come to Haven looking for a temporary escape, have a horribly painful (for Gabby) meet cute, and feel an instant attraction. Neither of them are looking for a relationship, though--Ethan has major hangups in that arena thanks to a less-than-ideal parental experience, and Gabby is fresh out of a bad relationship with an abusive and controlling ex and wants zero romantic entanglements until she feels more confident in her ability to take control of her own life once again.

Fortunately for us, fate--and Ethan's grandmother--have other ideas!

Ethan and Gabby embroil themselves in a fake relationship--it's pretty standard stuff where the troupe is concerned--and of course it ends up leading to the real thing. Naturally it takes both of them a while to 1) realize what's going on and 2) actually admit it to each other--otherwise we wouldn't have much of a story, right? (One of them nearly waits until the last page of the last chapter--grrr--fortunately, there's an adorable epilogue added on to make up for that character's total and utter cluelessness. ;)

There are a few threads left hanging in the story--Gabby's parents' attitude about Ethan, for example--but it's hard to get too worked up about them. Basically this is a cute story peopled with interesting characters in a world I'm looking forward to visiting again and again. If you're looking for a light and sweet story with plenty of series potential, look no further!

Im more of a dog person but Ive recently inherited a cat, and while shes not a klepto, she does have her own quirky personality.

I live in a small town and we also have a Cat Coalition. Veterinarians and the community work together to take care of our colony of feral cats living on the bluff by the bay. Offering neuter and spay services and making sure the cats are kept healthy and fed.

When cats start disappearing, Savannah, along with the Hammond Cat Alliance and the whole town, are determined to get to the bottom of it.

Savannahs stay becomes more complicated when she starts getting cozy with the sexy local vet, Michael Ivey.  A long distance relationship usually doesnt last.

Theres more than one mystery in this book. Savannah is kidnapped and her Aunt Margaret is being threatened. While cats are still disappearing.

There are lots of colorful characters, more than one kindling romance. and a serious mystery but not too dark. The story is easy to follow and reads quickly.

You don't need to be a cat lover to enjoy this cozy mystery. But you might be after meeting the furry characters.

1833,"I enjoy Joe Hart's style of writing - a lot.  I've made some time for myself for a Joe Hart reading marathon and CRUEL WORLD is the first book I'm reading (although it's not the first of his books I've read).

Post-apocalyptic or dystopian or zombie novels are all my favorite reading genres right now and this book is one of the better examples I've read that fits all three.

Quinn Kelly was born with severe facial deformities - a genetic condition called Fibrous Dysplasia. His mother left when he was young and his father is James Kelly, a famous movie actor. They live with staff members on an isolated estate in Maine, which Quinn has NEVER left.

Fast forward a few years and a flu pandemic decimated the world's population. And Quinn finally leaves all he's familiar with, immune to the killer virus.

Hart created quite a scary world within the pages of this story, with totally believable, fleshed-out characters.

I won't go into any more details in this review. Readers should experience the impact of this book on their own.

But I enjoyed it very much and I especially appreciate that it's a standalone novel (I just don't find enough non-series books anymore, at least in my opinion) and author Hart told his full scary tale within the pages of this book. I also liked having an epilogue.

She had been lusting after him secretly for months and it was time she let that be known.

301,"The Swap is a sweet and engaging middle school (the main characters are 12 and 13) read. Although the premise is very tired, the author's great use of dialogue and situations (as well as avoidance of turning this into a romance) help to create a very good book.  Both my 11 year old and I read this and we both enjoyed it greatly.

Story: 12 year old Ellie is crushed when her best friend suddenly turns very meant toward her.  12 year old Jack is focused solely on his dream of a hockey career.  When their lives intersect at the school nurse's office, both will wake up to find they have switched bodies. Ellie's emotionally heavy home is contrasted with Jack's very macho routine driven household.  Both will learn a lot about each other and even more about themselves as they spend the weekend in someone else's life.

The writing is easy to follow and the dialogue authentic. This isn't an excuse to do a romance, either, as both characters know the other only peripherally. It's really about respecting what each does and helping them get a perspective on their own lives. Ellie has to understand that her 'friend' is really nothing more than an insecure bully.  Jack needs to finally stand up to his very authoritarian father to ensure his own dream of hockey doesn't fade out.

We both really enjoyed this story and look forward to more books by this author.

2195,"""The Healing Hills"" by Ann H. Gabhart is about Francine Howard who when she finds out her boyfriend is coming home from the war (World War 2) with a English girlfriend decides to become a mountain nurse in the Appalachians.  As typical with Christian fiction novels it is also a romance book.  However the romance was a good part of the story but not sickening that I could not stand it.  It was an interesting story that also dealt with how people see and treat people from the backwoods of the Appalachians. I really enjoyed Francine's character as she not only did not believe the stereotypes of the locals but she broke the stereotype of the type of person the locals thought she was.  It was a good book on not judging others on where they come from.  It was an interesting story that I did enjoy so I do recommend it.

When George is found dead in his own compost heap in a particular vicious murder involving snakes, Agatha is determined to find out who did it.

Her colleagues, Toni, Simon, Phil and Patrick are all keen to help her as they don't like to see Agatha upset. All are worried for Agatha's safety when she starts to receive some very dubious attentions from an unknown source. Agatha herself is frightened and her private life seems to be falling apart when long time friend and occasional lover Sir Charles Fraith announces his engagement.

I really enjoyed this entertaining mystery and read it in less than twenty four hours. The plot is quite complex and I liked seeing more of Agatha's employees. I like the way the series characters are developing with everyone rallying round Agatha even while they accept she can be intensely annoying at times.

There are many amusing incidents in the story and there are also many where Agatha appears at her best such as in her dealing with the rival detective agency. She jumps to conclusions and puts herself in danger but her hunches are usually good and even the police are starting to pay more attention to what she says - while at the same time treating her as a loose cannon.

There were a few darker strands in this novel with the way the villagers are turned against Agatha by a few comments made by a few people. Some of the suspects are very dubious as well yet standing above it all is Mrs Bloxby, the vicar's wife, with her aura of calm.

9680,"Even though I already have some insect problems in the vegetable garden, I haven't used this there.
After doing a little research on the active ingredient, I learned that it can be harmful to bees.
Someone in our area must have taken up beekeeping a few years ago and I maintain several bee blocks for solitary bees.
We have quite a few toads in the garden, on the patio and other spots that consume a lot of insects.

We also have backyard chickens for the first time this year and I don't want to risk harming my chickens if I toss them a tomato hornworm or cutworm from the garden.  The squirrels steal all of the fruit from our fruit trees long before they are full size or mature, so I don't bother spraying them since we rarely get anything from them.

So after giving it some thought, I used this to spray around all of our windows and window ledges outside.  I sprayed the cracks in our driveway and on our patio.  I did apply it to our roses and other container plants in the front of the house, but chose not to apply it to anything in the vegetable garden.  When I need to deal with insect problems in the vegetable garden, I prefer to use products like neem oil, sal suds, BT or just a soap spray.  I don't want to cause any harm to the many bees that work so hard to pollinate everything in our yard.

From what I've read about the active ingredient, it doesn't appear to pose any substantial health risk to humans and breaks down fairly fast, but I prefer to use caution rather than chemicals on products we will consume and not risk harming beneficial insects.

2010,"Thought-provoking. Intriguing. Riveting. Siri Mitchell has done it again!

Mitchell does first-person POV brilliantly (as also exemplified in Chateau of Echoes and She Walks in Beauty). But The Messenger has a unique twist - first-person POV for both the hero and the heroine. And it works beautifully!

The American Revolution shakes Hannah Sunderland to the core. A British officer takes over her childhood home. Her new life with extended family - rich, Loyalist slave-owners - challenges her simple way of life as a Quaker. And her twin brother, who had his own reasons for laying aside his pacifist upbringing to fight for the revolutionaries, is suffering in jail.

Enter Jeremiah Jones - a wounded soul with a missing hand who has troubles of his own. And Hannah seems to be the only one who can help him.

Hannah and Jeremiah are wonderful characters to befriend and to watch develop in their understanding and maturity, and their interactions with the complex secondary characters (and each other) provide poignant opportunities for such growth. The setting, centered around the jail, offers a harsh, authentic backdrop to the drama as both of these characters deal with issues of identity, beliefs, and love. The Messenger is a well-told story of a tumultuous time in American history, while still dealing with important, timeless topics.

Mitchell's latest historical romance is deeply satisfying - not to be missed!

Romance, clean.
Nell is a young woman who is just learning about love, and trying to fit in society.  Her parents meet an untimely death, and Nell goes to live with an Aunt who is very unkind and uncaring.
As she tries to fit into this new life, she finds herself wondering what life will hold for her.
Her cousin, who seems to be a friend to her, is engaged.  As Nell interacts with Matthew, her cousin's fianc, she seems to find hope in the discouraging and sad place she is living.  Pearl, the Matchmaker (although Nell doesn't realize that's who she is) gives Nell hope, and helps her, although she can't find her shop and it seems abandoned and unused, when she tries to find it with Matthew later.  Pearl gives her the hope she needs to be more confident, and start the journey she needs to make the decisions that will bring her to love and a better future.
Nell's character, as she undergoes a transformation in the sad place she has been sent to live, reflects her inner goodness and kindness.  Her HEA is subtle in coming, and the contrast between her, and her cousin in how they deal and interact with others, along with her aunt, was sad for Nell to experience, but clearly defined their outcomes.  Rooting, and hopeful for Nell was obvious, contrasting her with the cousin who showed immaturity and selfishness, although perhaps she was just a girl making mistakes, but definitely no moral compass, made for an interesting read. The HEA wasn't clear, although you could see it start to come.  Nell's kindness to Matthew's mother in her illness, and her inner turmoils as she struggles to stay true to her loyalties to her cousin were worth the read.  Thanks again for another good installment to this series.",3,"[-2.403235996637611, -2.181059212892048, -1.4260391506289454, -1.0035230338007441, -1.0209708201413392]",-1.0035230338007441
3128,"I would like to extend a heartfelt ""Thank you"" to Boyd Morrison and his publisher for sending me a copy of ""The Ark"" to review for them. I am truly grateful for this generosity. I really appreciate the time, effort and expense it takes to make a reviewer copy available to me.

""The Ark"" by Boyd Morrison is a thinking man's tale of mystery and suspense.  This book is an exciting roller-coaster ride that grips the reader from the first few moments of the Prologue.  It takes you on an incredible journey of nearly non-stop action that makes ""The Ark"" difficult to put down.  This novel reminded me a bit of ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" - the archaeologist being coerced into pursuing her father's quest...the difference being that Indy chased the Holy Grail AND his father , Dilara Kenner merely chased the artifact.

""The Ark"" was a truly enjoyable suspense read.  The only thing I didn't care much for was how the origin of the ark itself was changed from how the Biblical account reads.  Other than that, this book has a multi-layered plot and gritty characters that make it a worthwhile way to spend a weekend.",3,"[-1.9424966999253876, -1.2312947821279971, -1.2260932671701212, -1.0096682476263856, -1.003601163425113]",-1.003601163425113

Riley was used to being the reasonable one, so she was a little freaked out when she wound up sleeping with her brother's best friend, Beck. It was so out of character for her. Beck was a hot fireman and an all around good guy. He has some personal baggage left over from his past relationship and doesn't want to burden Riley with it. What neither of them expected were the feelings that came out during this one night. They have a deep connection that goes way past the physical aspect of their relationship. Once things are out the real complications start. Will they work all out or will the lies be too much to overcome?

I love Faith's writing style and I absolutely loved the dual point of views. The characters are so well developed you feel like you really know them and can feel the emotions they go through. The story is filled with angst, emotional battles and sweet romance. Great story!!

She has hired Theo to pose as her boyfriend during a family gathering, to keep her family meddling at bay. She hopes to ward off their efforts to find her a partner and to convince her to move back to her hometown. I absolutely loved Theo. Though at times, he broke my heart. He and his brother never had it easy. Their backstory was heartbreaking, and they made some questionable choices when they were strapped for cash.

Theo and April had undeniable chemistry. Their scenes were filled with sweetness, sexiness and emotion.  I loved to see them getting to know each other better and revealing their inner selves. Their fake relationship felt more and more like a real one. The author portrayed the evolution of their relationship in a realistic way. Their blossoming romance was believable. I was able to see them change throughout, both as individuals and as a couple. They pretend with other people, but they are honest with each other. I think it really added to their growing bond.

Now Randi is back in Hallie's Falls at least temporarily and Rome is determined to to get another chance. He is sexy, charming, and just a bit rough around the edges. But he knows what he wants and is not afraid to push to get it. Randi is responsible, caring, a bit awkward, and overwhelmed with her life. She just planned to return briefly, but she is realizing that she might need to stay longer.

They have good chemistry and an attraction. Unfortunately, his second chance does not go quite as expected and she thinks they don't have much in common. She also has a lot going on in her life that she is needing to focus on. These two seem to be just keep missing their chance at something good. But Rome can also be patient and supportive, as well as persistent.

Can Rome convince her to give him a real chance and can he give her even more reason to stay home in Hallie's Falls?

This was a  short, sweet, and sexy second-chance love story layered with some emotional situations. I really loved Rome and  his determination.

441,"I had read this before, but it's certainly worthy of a second (or even a third) read, because it is among the best of the best of the hard-boiled detective genre.

The cool thing about Raymond Chandler novels is that they can be just as fun to read the second time around as they were the first. The plots are so intricate and convoluted that the twists and turns fascinate, even if the end is known. And the dialogue is just as fresh and clever the second time around.

The mystery here begins with the hiring of private detective Philip Marlowe by a dying millionaire with two wayward daughters. What starts with a simple case of blackmail quickly escalates into multiple murders and an underworld of gambling, pornography, and narcotics. Along the way, Marlowe is enticed by not one, but three, seductresses, and faces down several armed adversaries, all the while maintaining his cool and his principles and staying one step ahead of the game. The ending is somewhat surprising but logical, with all the clues given beforehand.

The multifaceted character Philip Marlowe is subtly and admirably portrayed. He is cynical and sentimental, sympathetic and pragmatic, tough and tender. Just the kind of guy I would like to know if I ran into a spot of trouble.

The dialogue, as always with Chandler novels, makes me envious of Philip Marlowe in the extreme. I certainly wish that I could think of such splendid come-backs on the spur of the moment. Don't all of us wish we could?

For readers today, the plot is slightly dated, because pornography (what would now be considered as soft pornography) and drug use are not as scandalous as they once were. Also, the attitude portrayed here toward homosexuality is subtly derogatory. Still, the time this was written (1939) must be taken into consideration, and the novel could easily be translated into modern day crimes and attitudes and still be valid and believable.

One of the best of the best of the hard-boiled detective genre.",4,"[-3.8434814335439187, -1.2946880572332993, -1.1482256145675256, -1.0043127420584268, -1.2583708069027137]",-1.0043127420584268

After seeing October Sky for the second time, I decided to buy this book for my science and math-minded 14-year old son. He read and loved it and I did too (the audio version was also excellent). What I enjoyed most about it is the author's storytelling skills. Homer Hadley Hickam, Jr. (or as I like to call him H-cubed) published the story when he was in his mid-fifties, but tells it as if he were still a teen. He introduces readers to the important persons in his life (which includes friends, family and residents of the town of Coalwood, Virginia, where he lives) then shows us how. Even knowing what's to come, I could not help cheering him and his friends for their rocket-design accomplishments, and feeling disappointed for their failures. His descriptions of the town, the mine, and small-town happenings are great. Those of the persons are so good that I feel as if I could accurately name them (without looking at the photos included in the book) if only I had the chance to spend a little one on one time with them, same with anecdotes and incidents involving his immediate family. Although his relationship with his larger than life father was sometimes heartbreaking, readers can't help sometimes sympathizing with him (in spite of his bullheadedness) because of his almost blind dedication to the mine and mining. As a bookworm who did my best to encourage my kids to become same, I love the fact that he was a big reader when he was young. I could go on and on about all the reasons that I love this book, but I won't because I'd rather that you read it so that you can find out for yourself. Also excellent: The Double Helix by James D.

The plot revolves around Lady Armitage, the widowed sister of one of the friends and her request for information about sexual matters from the most rakish of the group, Marcus, the Duke of Worthington.

They've each secretly been in love with the other since she was a teen, but Marcus didn't want to tie her down when he was fighting in the wars, so he said nothing, and her parents married her off while he was gone. After suffering a miserable marriage, she's relieved to be a widow.  Feeling she knows nothing about what should go on in the bedroom, she asks for some help, putting Marcus in a really awkward spot, but perhaps with an interesting opportunity to have another chance.

There are sexual scenes and sexual content and mild violence in this story. The first two full length books in the series are available already. I'm not sure if Marcus gets another story, but there are 5 Dukes in the group of friends, so likely 4 books.

In this particular book, the characters find themselves in a camp of sorts.  It is post ""the world as we know it"" and while Christians are permitted to hold on to their own beliefs, they are segregated from the rest of the people in the world.  These camps exist to allow the Christians freedoms, but they cannot leave the camps so their freedoms are really non existent.

The characters in this book are clever and range in their theological knowledge and where they are in their current beliefs.  The group of main characters manages to break free of the camp and they make their way to find a group of what they hope are Christians.  The interesting part is that this core group has only 1 page from the main character, Grant's, grandmother's Bible.  So while they know what that one page says, and a few of them have a slight memory of faith before the world changed, this group knows little about what Christianity is.

I thought this book was interesting and really delved into a variety of different beliefs that call themselves ""Christian"" but are not scripturally accurate.  I enjoyed the characters and their interactions with the other people they encountered along the way.

Heartbroken after learning that her ex is engaged to another, travel writer Rachel Foster ends up by error in hotel magnate Landon Court's penthouse. When she realizes that he mistakes her for a hooker, she just goes for a no string one-night stand.
She is a lucky girl, because Landon is a great character, generous and caring. After their first night, he wants to keep seeing her, knowing full well she is definitely no hooker. So he arranges for opportunities to meet her, under the pretext of articles to write.

Despite his financial and professional status, Landon is vulnerable. Orphaned at a young age, he is still very affected by the loss of his parents. As the story progresses, he is the one who will take the emotional risks to have a relationship with Rachel and go beyond the one week no string sexual arrangement she has agreed to.
They have great physical and emotional chemistry, but she remains very insecure and is confused by the intensity of her feelings. So there is a lot of push and pull from her side, as she is constantly fighting her attraction for him, and searching reasons to distance herself from him.

It begins with someone shooting an arrow that narrowly misses causing serious harm to Alafair, Dave's adopted daughter, and ramps up from there.

The personification of evil is a persistent theme in the Robicheaux series and few crime writers portray it as well as James Lee Burke.

His acolytes--allies as well as foes--include the corrupt rich, crooked cops and a bevy of hirelings.

680,"When I was invited to review this book, I must admit I was afraid it would be the standard ""happiness"" pitch. To my surprise and relief, this book turned out to be truly exceptional, beginning with the author's own story.

To be sure, much of the info in this book will be standard fare for anyone who's familiar with the life coaching industry. However, it's packaged in a way that appeals even to left-brained skeptics like me. The author cites research studies to back up each point. Some of the suggestions were totally new to me, and I thought I was deeply familiar with the field.

Just a few highlights that I enjoyed:

p. 55 - Work with a signature strength. This recommendation makes lots of sense to me. The book includes a link to a long online survey; I took the survey and found it surprisingly accurate. I'm a  little baffled by the authors suggestion to ""use it in a new way each day for a week.""

p. 67: I loved the discussion of Ellen Langer's research with ""senior"" men. Langer asked them to imagine themselves as they'd been 20 years earlier. They improved on physical as well as mental measures.

pp 72-73 - Great discussion of leisure. I really resonated to the notion that we tend to think any non-work activity is worthless. This belief becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

p. 121 - A startling experiment asks people to estimate how ""fortunate"" they would be if they were wounded in a bank robbery.  Great comment about interpretations of Wall Streeters!

p. 139 - Solving small problems can lead to big wins.

p. 163: Add 20 seconds to your day and gain several hours.

Highly recommended. I'm glad I got this book to keep instead of borrowing from the library. I want to read it a few more times.",4,"[-1.4863952853482363, -1.709934812740122, -1.1988021175169352, -1.0056402353737552, -1.5230762366793216]",-1.0056402353737552
1627,"Science fiction writer Philip K. Dick has imagined a world of the future in which those who die, if they are frozen quickly after death, can be kept in ""half-life"" for a period of time and can communicate with loved ones through the use of a ""protophason amplifier."" In this future, some people have developed strong psychic powers, many working for a company that specializes in sending psychics into businesses to be spies. To protect businesses by counteracting the psychics, ""prudence organizations"" employ people who can sense psychic activity and ferret out the snoopers.

Thus enters Glen Runciter, owner of the foremost prudence organization; his wife Ella, who is in half-life; and Joe Chip, his second-in-command. The company receives a big job on Luna, taking 11 psychic-sensors along, only to be caught in an ambush staged by its psychic competitors. And Glen Runciter is killed, or is he? Everyone else lives and escape back to earth, but then time begins to shift for the 11 survivors, sometimes with disastrous results. And they keep receiving cryptic messages from their dead boss, sometimes written on bathroom walls. Just what is going on here?

This is not your standard sci-fi novel, needless to say. ""Ubik"" is short for ""ubiquitous""--existing or being everywhere at the same time. In the novel it is a product which can be used for almost anything, including an aerosol spray that can halt the killing effects of time-shift. Questions are raised here about the nature of reality and belief, and the reader thinks he has received the answer to the puzzle, until the last chapter. Then, oops, maybe all that was the wrong answer.

Science fiction is often dismissed when critics are choosing ""great"" novels, probably because it tends to be formulaic. Even though his chosen genre was science fiction, Phillip K. Dick didn't always follow the rules. This novel is funny; it gives you some philosophical matters to think about; it keeps you riveted to find out what happens next; its main character is engaging. It is well worth your time even if you are not a sci-fi fan.

303,"Adorable. Witty. Fun. Perfect for a quick, light summer read. With a sequel out recently, its just in time! Reminiscent of the Amanda Bynes movie, What a Girl Wants or Anne Hathaways The Princess Diaries, what girl wouldnt want to wake up and find out shes royalty (or the closest thing to it)? Although entirely implausible, its fun to dream. And if dreams came true, this one was written to be fairly believable.

Samantha is the total down-to-earth, borderline tomboy, grad student who studies wildlife biology with a focus in falconry (being an Animal Science major, I totally clicked with this).  Her best friend is her continual link to style, gossip, and the outside world in general. Alex is the proposed Royal playboy, who is currently staying out of the lime light due to a recent sex scandal started by an ex. His interest in Samantha begins because 1- she has no idea who he is, or what hes supposedly done, and 2- his country is known for falconry, and he appreciates the shared interest.

The main thing I didn't like was Samanthas total reticence towards the whole relationship with Alex (because hes true royalty, while shes only considered nobility). She tried to talk herself out of it for then entire book, despite the obvious mutual attraction, and his constant reassurance that her arguments were baseless.

Once she got over her hang-ups it was a pretty decent story. Cant wait to catch up on the next two in the series!

Then way the City of Austin, Texas is described made me long to visit the city as soon as possible.  Andy Prescott, an Austinite, seeks thrill in his bi-cycle and riding the winding trails; he blatantly lies being at the church on Sunday morning while seeking his thrills riding a mountain bike at such speeds over a single-track hacked out of the wilderness and teetering on the edge of a steep ravine.

Andy and his friends spend a lot of time looking for a soul mate and responding to the ads.  Andy, having had a mediocre academic achievements, settles down to being a lawyer and specializes in defending those ticketing for traffic violations and develops his special techniques.

Andy's mundane life is shattered with the entry of a billionaire retaining Andy at a very high hourly rate to help the billionaire with his social-welfare projects.  But then, the billionaire drags Andy into another assignment which turns out to be intriguing and dangerous too.

The author is most imaginative and uses the complete city of Austin to take the readers around as Andy tries to save his own life from paid killers.

4206,"I occasionally like to read stories about young love/young adults. This one primarily takes place when the main characters are older teens (17-18). It is told from dual POVs. Nikki grew up in Texas. She had a difficult upbringing with her single mom who was diabetic and had bipolar disorder. More than once growing up she was removed from her home and placed in foster care. She and her mom had moved multiple times and were living in a trailer park when her mother died. After her mom's death she shockingly discovers she has both an aunt and a fraternal twin, a sister, whom she never knew about. Her mission becomes to find her sister. After legal hurdles are cleared and the school year ends she moves in with her aunt in California.

Zach (who lives in California) suffered a heartbreaking emotional loss that caused him to withdraw from everyone. He is consumed with grief and guilt. Six months after the tragedy, he is finally returning to school at the beginning of his senior year at the insistence of his parents. He is still trapped in the endless cycle of his emotions, with friends and family unable to reach him, when he meets Nikki. An unexplainable bond is there between them from the beginning.

This is a great story of  young love and new beginnings. Zach and Nikki individually and together face a multitude of ups and downs.

675,"I have been a fan of Lincoln Child and Douglas Preston since I read RELIC, the first book in the Pendergast series.  That particular series has provided me with hours of thoughtful entertainment, although like any other longer series of novels, it has had its shares of ups and downs.  My favorite still remains THE CABINET OF CURIOSITIES, coincidentally another novel that features a dark and gloomy old mansion. I have also read and enjoyed several of Lincoln Child's individual efforts but remain convinced that their joint efforts in the Pendergast series showcases their best work.

When you first see the cover of THE FORGOTTEN ROOM, it reminds you of the setting of an abandoned insane asylum sitting on a hill, surrounded by the clouds and lightning of a severe storm, and overlooking dark and furious waters.  And yes, there is a light on in one of the rooms.  So I expected an old fashioned 'ghost story' set in an old haunted mansion, massive in size, with creepy rooms and dark furnishings, populated with shifting shadows and whispers in the dark.  It appeared obvious that 'evil' had taken up residence here.

What I discovered instead was quite a different story of mystery and madness based on something unexpected and unusual, an intricate story on its own merits, but deviating substantially from what I expected.

The heroine has been sexually assaulted and manages to get home. She does tell her parents what happened but refuses to be forced to marry her attacker or to be sent to the country to hide.  Her brother is also apprised of the crime.  He considers calling the man out but doesn't want to lay bare to society what happened.  His sister would be ruined.  He does wind up telling his best friend, who as it happens has just been told by his dying father that he is to take a wife.

The BFF, the hero, finds himself admiring the heroine's spirit as well as her looks.  He decides to make her an offer of marriage.  She accepts though she is sure she won't make a good wife.

The heroine talks a lot about being scarred and afraid after what happened to her, but apparently all it takes to get over it is an attractive, gentle and patient man.  Only in fiction, dear reader, only in fiction.  She is melting in his arms and ready to consummate their marriage before they reach the hero's estate.

The man who attacked her turns up murdered.  They had to leave town quickly and take her brother with them.  The rapist's brother suspects the heroine's brother killed him.  There is a twist to the story regarding the rapist.

This book was of no irregularity of that specific trait and like other novels written by both the authors I savored Cape Cod Promises.

Honestly if there is one book that I could see appealing to readers this year I would choose this book as this story is about a second chance at both love and of happiness. Both Trent and Reese fell in love when they were young and then realized that the love that they had for one another couldn't survive the world around Trent's hectic work schedule.

My favorite character by far within this book was Reese. I felt like she was the more reasonable character from the duo. She had her heartbroken by Trent in the past. She had lived her life keeping a safe distance from the man that she had once loved and had married in reflection of that love. Reese was entirely relatable to the modern woman in the way that she still felt strong about her feelings for Trent and I think most of us have experienced that before in our own lives about an ex. I deeply admired Reese for her willingness to give Trent a second chance once that spark was ignited once more on one summer night.

This story was a different read for me. I normally do not read second chance romances because I cannot bring myself to believe that a person is capable of surviving such a chance at love the second time well, Reese and Trent made me want to consider to continue to read second chance romances.

This is a unique opportunity for Chelle to live an adventure and figure out what she wants in life. I loved how Chelle and Mason turn each others life upside down, it was funny but also emotional.
Mason is successful and ambitious, but he lacks a purpose other than professional. Scarred by his past and his distant relationship with his father, he is convinced he is incapable of love.
I liked the way the author described the evolution of Chelle and Masons relationship from fake engagement to true feelings. Apparently, they have nothing in common, but in reality, they are perfect for each other.
I enjoyed this story of a chance encounter that will change everything.  It was an easy, fairly slow build up read, without angst and with likeable characters. If, like me, you enjoy stories where the characters have to make a life choice, make peace with their past and discover what or who is their game changer, this story is perfect for you.

1199,"Noa P. Singleton has been on death row awaiting her execution for the past ten years. Six months before ""x-day"", the mother of her victim Marlene Dixon suddenly visits and introduces her to Oliver, a young attorney who is willing to help Marlene, herself a high-powered lawyer, seek clemency for Noa. Marlene has had a change of heart and doesn't want to see Noa die. Perhaps life in prison will be a better punishment for the murderer of her only daughter. But what Marlene really wants is the truth.

Written as a prison memoir by Noa, The Execution of Noa P. Singleton by Elizabeth L. Silver takes us back to her early life and the events that set in motion the crime for which Noa was convicted and sentenced to death by the state of Pennsylvania. Brilliant in style, Silver takes the reader into the mind of the convict. Noa is a memorable character, conflicted and sympathetic--who is simultaneously trying to impress with her pretentious vocabulary and metaphors, yet pass herself off as a humble victim of circumstance. Her story of how the girl, once at the top of her high school class and admission into an Ivy League School, ends up on death row is compelling and dramatic and just a bit over-the-top.",3,"[-1.349778486833581, -1.24385148504251, -1.1562964424270785, -1.0069703863795008, -1.1738818402628732]",-1.0069703863795008

They start receiving postcards from someone who was part of their life some fifty years ago, when they all were children, someone they thought was a part of this past.  But why is this person contacting them?  What are the real motives now of someone who had treated the two siblings  and everyone else  so cruelly when they were children?

Willett does an excellent job with characterization; readers can easily see the characters, and I liked the idea of the characters being older.  The setting is just as clear; even readers who have never been to Cornwall can imagine the setting as they read.  The way Willet handles the plot is also excellent; readers visit events in Billas and Eds childhood and wonder, too, who this person contacting them is and why he wants back in their lives.

Professional reviewers have compared Willetts work to Rosamunde Pilchers and Maeve Binchys.  This work shares some qualities of these authors works, but it is distinctive because it does have a  thriller vein; readers wonder, too, what the person sending the postcards really wants and must be patient as Willett reveals information.",4,"[-1.6024543188125377, -1.3511706741730387, -1.2742414048375594, -1.01194620216014, -1.0069947559805867]",-1.0069947559805867
2199,"This book, Christmas at Harmony Hill is my first Shaker Story.

Christmas-at-Harmony-Hill

 Ann H. Gabhart writes Shaker stories and this is her first Christmas one.  I enjoyed her mix of history (Civil War is going on), the romance (a young couple is separated by the war), and the family drama.

In this story a young woman who has been on the front lines of the war with her husband, decides to return home to deliver her baby.  Upon arriving home she must face terrible news and a unwelcome response from her family.  As a result she turns to an aunt she does not know, who lives in a Shaker community for help.

I found the Shaker story line very intriguing.  Their beliefs were completely new to me, and were more than fascinating.  As I read about their customs and why they do what they do, it made me think about why we do what we do.  I also pondered how their beliefs differed so much from biblical teaching and my own faith.

I enjoyed the story line of Gideon and Heather, their relationship was quite deep for such a young couple.  Their faith in their relationship and their closeness was very tender and sincere.

This was a very interesting story that I enjoyed very much.  I hope to get a chance to read more novels by Ms. Gabhart.

Rather than a professional crime fighter trying to solve what happened, this is about two mothers from very different backgrounds who meet up with each other in the North Dakota oil field country to find out what happened to their sons who are missing.

But they keep pushing even when they end up in conflict with each other about their sons.

7611,"The good:  Logitech is the first word out of my mouth. As a rule, they build solid, dependable products. We have two Logitech keyboards that we use and like. This is a Bluetooth keyboard, which means cordless. Having a keyboard on the Mini means that you have the full Mini screen to see what you are typing rather than the portion displayed above the Apple keyboard. The stand also makes a more comfortable viewing and typing position--like you are using a mini-laptop or netbook. You've got quick keys, which speed up the process--even quick keys especially for the Mini. The keyboard is fairly responsive--more so than the iPad keyboard for me.

The bad: As a touch typist, the keys feel a bit close together. If you use a standard keyboard, this might feel crabbed at first--particularly if you have big fingers. I personally think the Logitech keyboard is better than the iPad's, but you really are going to have to watch hand-cramping when you use it and make sure your wrist posture is correct. (I am particularly sensitive to this since I have Carpal Tunnel in both hands)

The heavy:  If, like me, you bought a Mini because the standard iPad was getting heavy, this keyboard will make your Mini top out at just a bit above a pound.  (Mini without WiFi is 10.8 ounces, the cover adds 7.2 for a total of 18 ounces) This may be better once I get done with carpal tunnel surgery, but right now--I am leaving the keyboard behind and using dictation unless I know I am going to need it.

Overall, I think the Logitech keyboard is going to be a useful addition to the iPad Mini. The weight it adds should be offset by its better efficacy as an input device.

8901,"The Crepes of Wrath introduces us to the Flip Side Pancake House (isnt that a fun name for a restaurant?) and the small coastal town of Wildwood Cove, as well as a bevy of main and minor characters.  As this is the start of the series, I am curious to see how some of the more vivid characters will come into the spotlight in future books  particularly the gruff chef Ivan who I know has a good story in him. And, of course, you know I have my eye on the budding romance between Marley and Brett

The mystery is well-plotted and kept me guessing. Typical to cozies, the town is full of potential murderers and every time I thought I had it figured out someone else did something suspicious. While the plot was well-constructed, it did slow a bit in several places to allow for Marleys lengthy bouts of introspection. Which I guess shes allowed after her cousin died but sometimes it felt as though we were just rehashing the same emotions. And though I appreciated that she was a fairly realistic amateur sleuth, there were moments when I wanted to holler at the book, THAT WAS IMPORTANT! CALL THE SHERIFF!! Ok and also  the sheriff? Needs to answer his phone more when she does get around to calling. Im just sayin. I hollered at him too, in case you were wondering.

Bottom Line: The Crepes of Wrath by Sarah Fox is cute, action-packed, and engaging. While the main character is quite likable, her actions don't always make sense and her introspection gets a bit repetitive. Still, the town of Wildwood Cove contains a mix of characters who keep the interest level  and the suspect list high. The setting sounds absolutely gorgeous and the authors descriptions from scene to scene make me wish i had the time and money to plan a vacation in Puget Sound. I am looking forward to the next book which I believe comes out in March, and I especially want to know more about Ivan as the series progresses.

I was a bit disappointed with Sage's ""problem"", though--first, it was may to easy to figure out what it was, and second, I wasn't crazy about the person who ended up being the cause of it. It seems to take the whole small-town-everyone-is-connected-somehow bit just a tad too far. The solution at the end of the novel also has me torn--it could be a good idea, or it could cause waaaay to many problems down the road, but either way it deserves more than a minute and a half discussion in a hospital room.

I like sports-centric inspirational kind of movies but I was a bit concerned that this might be a bit too preachy for my tastes.  But in reality the message has been toned down to the point so that it really doesnt try to push the concept of faith down your throat.  This movie is in the vein of other similar style of football movies but isn't quite as flashy as those and maybe not as strong overall but I really like the message that it tries to convey that sports is not the most important thing in life and whether you win or lose isn't what you will be remembered for but how you handle those situations in life.

Delaney Diamond did the damn thing with this book.  After meeting Trenton and Alannah in the first two books in the series, I was curious as to how their story would play out.  I was especially curious about Trent, since he's a Johnson cousin, and not an actual sibling (I'm glad that this wasn't at all an issue, and he's treated as a sibling).  I had no idea that the back story of how he came to live with the Johnson family was so tragic.  I assumed he was going to be the typical handsome as sin, spoiled, rich playboy, but that wasn't at all the case.  I mean, he's handsome as sin, spoiled, rich and a playboy, but his past humanizes him and gives him an endearing quality that I'm at a loss to describe.

Trent and Alannah have been besties since they were eight years old.  She's been in love with him for quite a while, but that poor fool has no idea that he's also in love with her.  Trent's reactions to Alannah, her changing style, as well as men's reactions to and interactions with the new and improved Alannah made for SO many laugh out loud moments in this book.

1437,"Many people describe the Sandman books as Gaiman's greatest work. I have to agree with that assessment.  Over the course of the series, Gaiman brings together a wealth of his interests, from Jewish mysticism to Shakespeare.  The sheer scope makes it one of the most ambitious group of books ever written.  Indeed, like the best of fantasy, the author creates an entire new world for us to explore and enjoy.
I agree with those who say that this is the weakest of the long series.  That said, it is the first and sets the stage for what comes after.  For those who have not read the series and want to, I suggest reading season of the mist first (book four) and then read from Preludes forward.  Alternatively, you can start here.  The important thing is to not simply read this, get confused and stop.
Remember, Gaiman builds on his work towards the end of the story.  Each book adds important characters and facts that recur later.  What seems minor may play a crucial role later in the story.  The series is a must for serious fantasy fans.

1543,"I absolutely loved the plot and storyline of ARCHANGEL'S VIPER. I really enjoyed seeing how the Uram issue played out as we've had those threads dangling for many books now. I have to admit the outcome was a bit of a surprise, not a bad one, but interesting all the same. And Holly? I really love her character, mini claws, vulnerability, and sheer will of determination combined. Uram sure did a number on her and as you can guess the outcome with him fully involved Holly, and I really enjoyed this progression. So plot-wise, this one was stellar.

Now onto the romance. Unfortunately this area was not one of the book's strong suits due to an undeveloped feel in the romance aspects. There's plenty of wit, banter, and overall antagonism between the two that left me laughing more often than not at their antics. And yet, they never really had a sexual tension feel. Venom and Holly could have just as easily been best friends rather than lovers by the end. I just feel like things were written tamer taking Holly's past into consideration, but it just went too tame in my opinion. I just needed something more of a build up to be invested in their romance at the end and unfortunately I just didn't get it.

Romance aside and getting back to the characters, as I said I loved seeing Holly's progression in this book. But the show stealer was Venom, much to my surprise. I have to admit he's never been my favorite of the seven, more of an antagonist to Elena. But we get to see a whole new side of him in this book, and I really loved the added depth to his character. There are reasons he is the way that he is, and it was enjoyable to see his layers get peeled back.

6585,"Under Her by Samantha Towle is a fun enemies to lovers romance that will have readers developing a serious addiction for this couple.

Wilder...what can I say about this hero? He really is kind of a jerk, completely arrogant, 100% playboy material, and on some level immature. Samantha Towle, however, with the use of 1st person point-of-view, somehow makes him likable. His inner-dialogue had me laughing, and there is a level of humility that shines at just the right time to make him endearing.  Wilder really shouldn't be a hero to love but he is.

Morgan is an amazing heroine for so many reasons, but what drew me to her particularly is her tenacity. She has worked for everything in her life, and she is smart and fierce in the business world. What readers will really enjoy is that she doesn't get hung up on the past. She has moved on, grown up, and left it behind, but she hasn't forgotten it. Independence and intelligence are key factors for me when it comes to a heroine, and Morgan has these two attributes in spades.

Under Her falls into the hate to love plot structure, with their antagonistic relationship stemming from their interactions in college. The hate mixed with the palpable sexual tension between the two makes for an incredibly well paced relationship. Readers get to see the hate transform into something else in a natural way. The conflict, however, came a little late in the story for me, and the quick resolution gave me a bit of whiplash. Although, I wasn't expecting the conflict, I did expect who/what would cause the conflict to occur. Even with this quick problem and resolution, I still thoroughly enjoyed this story and all of the characters in it.

For Anya Von Bremzen food is more about the life of a country as well as the life of a family.  The book looks at life in the Soviet Union from the last days of the Czars until the present through the food her grandparents, parents and her family ate as well as the food the people ate.

Despite limits on what was available the author talks about the creativity her mother used as a young girl to make good tasting meals. She also talks about her interest in cooking and how she learned to get creative with little. In many ways the history of the Soviet Union and any country can be told by the food available.

This is more than a tale about food. It is about her mother's life during  World War II. It talks about and waiting on line for food and crowded living conditions. It talks about hope despite harsh living conditions and  the love of a family despite those living conditions.

The book also includes one recipe for each decade starting in 1910 and ending in the twenty first century. Each recipe symbolizes what was happening in the Soviet Union at the time.

This is a heartwarming  book to read despite the breath of history examined and the often difficult circumstances faced by the  people of the Soviet Union. It also  examines the importance food plays in our memories since it is often a reflection of our families station in life and a countries political and economic situation.",4,"[-2.808982548043928, -2.011261577571129, -1.2334044637225872, -1.0177551494143389, -1.0107307998424484]",-1.0107307998424484

847,"When her father dies suddenly, a girl and her mother are left destitute in 17th Century Persia. Selling the carpet they had hoped would earn the girl's dowry, the two travel to Isfahan where the girl's uncle lives. He is happy to see her interest in carpet making and encourages her, but his wife treats both the girl and her mother as servants. When they sell the girl into a temporary marriage, her fortune seems made, but bad luck, impulsive decisions, and the Aunt's greed turn against the girl and her mother.

Author Anita Amirrezvani creates a work of magical realism. Set in a world somewhere between reality and fantasy, Amirrezvani mixes narative with fairy tales, heaps one disaster after another on the girl's head until she is forced to resort to begging. The girl's list of bad luck is not really believable, but her rash decisions certainly make each twist in fortune that much worse.

Amirrezvani seems to have chosen each word with care--like each knot of one of the carpets she describes. The result is a beautiful work and a pleasure to read.

Ultimately the girl needs to find a balance between independence and dependence. Without the teachings, support, and encouragement of her uncle, she would have fallen ever deeper into disaster--yet at times, she seems to believe that she did everything herself. And some of the disasters, particularly her uncle's decision to give away her first carpet without compensating her seem farfetched considering what we know of his character.

Finding and loving a new author is something that I get so excited about. Especially when it's someone that might not have shown up on my TBR list normally. Well that is the case with H.P. Davenport and this wonderfully written book.

Ms. Davenport has a way with words that just drew me into the story. This was also a story that I especially love, Friends to Lovers. Camryn and Jamie have been friends for their entire lives. There was always a special bond between them. As they grew up, their feelings towards each other changed, but they were both afraid to say anything for fear of losing their best friend.

When Cami goes home for an extended work assignment, she decides she's going to take the plunge and confess to Jamie. Well, this is where the story gets interesting as there are all sorts of obstacles that get in their way, including, but not limited to Cami's twin brother, a miscommunication with Jamie, another guy who expresses interest in her.

Add into this mix their group of friends that have also all grown up with each other and the side stories are fabulous. So many interesting personalities at play in this book. I'm thinking there's a few more books that can come out of this group of friends. At least I'm hoping so anyway.

The entire time I was reading this book I just fell more and more in love with the story and with Jamie and Cami as a couple. How he loves her, and their unspoken words was a true emotional rollercoaster ride. I laughed at some of their shenanigans, I cried, yes cried, because there's something that happens that came completely and totally out of left field. It was an emotionally charged part of the book that I had some vehement feelings about. I even sent a message to Ms. Davenport ranting about it!!!

Needless to say, after this happens, Cami and Jamie's love is truly tested. Can what happened end their story before it's really begun or will this bring them closer and just solidify what everyone has always known, that Cami and Jamie can be each other's ""lobster?""

Molly Dekker is what you would call a nice, good girl. At the age of seventeen, she got engaged. At the age of nineteen, she had her son Josh. At the age of twenty-four, she became a single mother when her husband decided he didn't want to be a father or be married. Now, at the age of twenty-nine, she is dealing with the heartbreaking reality that her child will not have the life she imagined for him.

Gabriel Morales is a man struggling with his own new reality. A former pararescuer, his career ended with a helicopter crash in Afghanistan. The same crash in which his best friend, Mollys older brother was killed. Since returning stateside, Gabriel has been living like a hermit, in a secluded cabin in the woods of Copper Mountain.

In a moment out of character for Molly, she envisions an incredible evening with Gabriel, only to have the evening turn into her worst nightmare when she hears that her son is missing. With help and authorities too far away, Gabriel steps back into a world he knows and is comfortable in, that of helping and rescuing people.

One thing Marietta, Montana is good at is helping their own. When its discovered that Molly is struggling with taking care of Josh and paying their bills, the town and its residents step in and organize a charity bachelor auction. Of course, the best bidder ends up with Gabriel.

In One Night with Her Bachelor, Kat Latham takes readers on a wonderful journey of love, pain, redemption, and second chances. The story mentions Gabriels two half-brothers, one of which Im currently begging to get a story on. I loved reading about Molly, Gabriel, and Josh. I just wish there was more to the story.

With his ex-man-whore conquests, and her ex, there is quite a bit of angst in this hot and steamy romance.

There is quite a cast of secondary characters and you will LOVE them. They really add fun and spice to the story. I look forward to reading about them in future books - especially Tony and Francesca and Violet and Cain. You definitely enjoy hanging out and getting to know themwell, most of them

Slade was by far the highlight of the story. He is a whole lot of hot - caring, funny, honest  the list of qualities that I found endearing could go on. He is what made the story and kept me turning page after page. FULL CONTACT is a fun and sexy read, full of passion and fire, and with lighthearted moments perfectly balanced with the serious.  I recommend, and am looking forward to the next book in the series.

3524,"J.T. Geissingers third book in her Bad Habits series was an amazing read!  I have been curious about Grace and Brodys relationship and how it would transpire since the very beginning.  I couldn't have been happier with the results.

Initially, I wasn't sure how I would feel about Grace.  Shes made no bones about the fact that she doesnt do commitments and doesnt believe in refraining from sex for any length of time.  However, once Brody determines its time to find redemption from past mistakes, he begins to make his intentions known and Grace finds herself falling for the lead guitarist.  As Graces personal struggles and fears are revealed I understood the decisions she had made in her life.  Mrs. Geissinger kept her true to character throughout the whole book, a decision I respected and approved of.

Grace and Brodys banter was so much fun to read and they just clicked on so many levels.  I loved when Brodys housekeeper Magda entered the picture and showed another quirky side to him.  It is a hilarious scene and worth the read for that alone.  The chemistry between the hero and heroine was intense, hot and had some serious steam.  I knew that Brodys original deal was going to be blown to kingdom come.

Of course they both have things from their past that they are struggling with and those problems strike them at a time when they are both emotionally down.  The result is a nerve-racking journey that I frantically raced through to get to the conclusion.

Some of the scenes with Graces present boyfriend at the beginning of the book and the fact that a third party was the one to help clear the air between the H and h at the end resulted in the loss of one star in my rating.

I enjoyed seeing the characters from the previous books and getting a look into some of the things going on in their lives.  There is also a great epilogue that leads me to believe we may have another great series on the horizon.

5598,"We're in Tudor England during the reign of Henry VIII, but let's forget about the beautiful people at Whitehall Palace, the ones stuffing their faces with delicious delicacies, wearing jewels and silks and worrying about wives and how to get rid of them.

Instead we go to the other side of the Thames, to the areas teeming with poverty and misery, dirt, grime and offal, illness and desperation. This is a gritty story, not a pretty one, but I found it interesting because I enjoy historical mysteries and that's what we have here.  It's the beginning of the Bianca Goddard mystery series and I look forward to reading more of them.

Bianca is the estranged daughter of a rather infamous alchemist.  She has gone off to live on her own and supports herself by concocting ""medicals and physickes"" for the poor of Southwark and other slum areas of London.  Unfortunately, when a friend of hers dies at her shop and it seems to be a death by poisoning, suspicion lies at her door.  Now she has to find out what happened to her friend Jolyn before Constable Patch arrests her and puts her in the Clink (really existed/something new I learned) to await trial and probable hanging.

This story looks at the ugly side of London in 1543, with quite the cast of characters, not least of which are the rats.  And let me tell you, they're everywhere and they are a gross and gruesome addition to the story.  London's worst and last outbreak of the plague was in 1665 but there were less famous outbreaks every 20-30 years from 1348-1665.  It's easy to see why when you read this story.

For the mystery and for the attempt to be a realistic portrayal of life in London for the ""not so rich and famous"", I give this almost 5 stars.  However, the protagonist Bianca is portrayed as a bit of a cold fish and that brings my rating down to 4.  She needs to become a more real, feeling person.  Her life prior to the beginning of this story is hinted at and sounds very interesting but is too sketchy.  I'd like to know more about her and her feelings.  However, I do read historical mystery for the mystery itself so I was satisfied with this first entry in the series.

3956,"If you've read any of the Torn series by K. A. Robinson, then you know the story of Chloe and Drake.  And while their story probably could have ended where it did at the end of book two, the author gives us just a little bit more to show us what Drake and Chloe went through to get to that epilogue at the end of TWISTED.

Broken up into three parts.  In part one we get Drake's POV as he deals with the fallout from his addiction and the steps he takes to overcome them.  It's not an easy fight and it's one that Drake struggles with for half the book.  But we do finally get to the root cause for Drake's addiction and see the light at the end of the tunnel when he finally recognizes that too.  It's by no means an easy road for Drake, he knows what his prize is if he does overcome all of this.  So he fights.  And it's a good fight that gets him back to a healthy place and forces him to grow up.

Part two is from Chloe's POV three months after she and Drake have gotten back together.  She's finally moving with him to LA and it's during the road trip that Chloe asks the hard questions from Drake and is open to listening.  She's knows he will face a daily battle with his addiction, but she knows he needs her complete faith in him.  Where Chloe would have kept things to herself, she now voices her concerns, asks the hard questions and puts building their relationship in front of the very physical responses they had to each other before.  And just like Drake, Chloe is forced to grow up a bit too.

The final part takes place several months after the epilogue, told in Drake's POV again.  This is the HEA for Chloe and Drake as they start their family together.  It was nice to see their devotion to one another and that they did take time for themselves before they started a family.  But you could tell, just for this short part of the book, that they are settled and ready to take on this next challenge in their lives.

If you haven't read the Torn series, they you absolutely must before picking this one up.  For those that have, it's a perfect ending for a couple that had a really rocky start, but managed to find a way to fight to make it work.",3,"[-3.6663907123074244, -1.7729347097008101, -1.3131776044730734, -1.0113257482907485, -1.1856393656441029]",-1.0113257482907485
1816,"A Loyal Heart is the fourth (and final?) book in Jody Hedlunds medieval young adult series, and out of the bunch, it is also my favorite. I found the plot to be the most realistic and the characters to be the most relatable. Olivias character arc drew me in. She is a strong character, both physically and mentally, but it never seemed out of context for the time  as in, she isn't suddenly stronger and faster than knights who were larger and more trained than she was. She has a lot of pride, but not too much to come across as aggravating or unrealistic. She may believe a little too long in someone she shouldnt have but, under certain circumstances, I think many have believe something of someone because the alternative is just too heartbreaking.

I also like that the reader gets to experience the story from the point of view of both characters. This kept this story suspenseful, but also allowed for getting to know both of them throughout the course of the story. Aldric was a somewhat shadowy, tragic figure in the previous book, so it was good to learn more about him. Both Olivia and Aldric show tremendous loyalty to both family and brothers-in-arms, even at great personal cost, and I admired that about them.

This book is very much a romance, but I found it all to be sweet and with good boundaries for younger readers. Though its never a surprise to me when the characters realize they're in love, its fun getting to that point with them. In addition, a clear faith element is woven in nicely throughout the story. Both characters experience growth and change as individuals, which is always refreshing.

Overall, this is a winsome, charming story, with both romance and action to keep the pages turning.

3007,"A small English village populated by a motley group of eccentric characters is a time honored setting for murder and mayhem. In Sidney Chambers and The Shadow of Death James Runcie has created a refreshing new variation on that familiar theme.  Grantchester is a seemingly insignificant little place in England in the early 1950s, and Sidney Chambers is the seemingly insignificant vicar who oversees a dwindling flock of the faithful. Chambers, however, is a complex man. A veteran of World War II, intelligent and dutiful, he has a sharp and analytical mind which he is willing to turn to the assistance of the police when they have need of it, as they often seem to do.  Chambers manages to combine his investigative work with his normal parish duties while dealing with some personal concerns: unmarried and in his early thirties, he is friends with some women but not yet ready to think of them as anything more than that.

The stories in this first volume of the Grantchester Mysteries are independent of each other, though naturally  there are some recurring characters and themes. Most take place in and around Grantchester, with some excursions to London. The usual cast of characters is in place: a noble lord, a talkative housemaid, a skeptical policeman, and another cleric or two.  As is true of the best detective stories, the reader is as fascinated by the investigator's own mind and personality as he is by the puzzle to be solved. Those of us who enjoyed the TV dramatizations of the stories in this volume will be pleased to note that some of the best lines are taken verbatim from the text. And all of us who have become fond of Sidney, his increasingly important friend Amanda, and Inspector Keating will be glad to know that Runcie intends to trace their stories from the early 1950s to the 1980s.",4,"[-3.1148360666870465, -1.4100682277501453, -1.5146486462856708, -1.0115923514108434, -1.1697258078389785]",-1.0115923514108434

It does have her usual angst, twists, drama, and appearances from previous characters, but this is set in a darker, grittier world. Even though I don't particularly like mafia themed romances, I wanted to see Rachel Van Dyken's take on it because I thoroughly enjoy her way of writing and I enjoyed El and Dante's story. It is definitely not your conventional, straightforward love story, but it's all Rachel Van Dyken and BRILLIANT!
Obviously, I cannot go into great detail about the book and what it is about because it has a lot of twists, turns, and surprises in the plot and it is better experienced in reading the book, but I totally recommend this book to those who are open minded when it comes to romantic suspense and doesn't mind a complex plot.

There were terrible parts of the story I didn't enjoy. Such places as the horrific orphanages Ms. McKenna writes about actually existed, and the ugliness of that reality isn't easy to learn about. But to balance things out, the characters got into situations where I laughed out loud.

When schoolteacher Lydia gets out for the summer, her friend gives her something to look forward to besides remaining at the beck and call of her widowed, ailing mother.

This is not a romance, even though it sounds like the beginnings of one. It's a reminder of how inhumane caretakers of children can warp lives. It's also a portrait of how hope is an integral part of the human character. It's also a story of how strange life can sometimes be.

We will be spending some time in Provence, though not mingling with the locals to the extent that Mayle did when he and his wife moved from England and bought an old farm house to remodel and live year around. Mayle's adventures in hiring contractors and getting any work done on a reliable timetable are told humorously, thought with no disrespect to the French workers. They learn that in France, time is marked by seasons rather than days. They finally devise an ingenious method to get all the contractors to come back and complete the various unfinished projects around the house before Christmas - they send out invitations to a champagne reception to which the spouses are also invited. They know that none of the contractors will want their partners to be embarrassed by incomplete work !

Mayle also writes of their journeys to visit fabulous restaurants and the French love of food and wine. He cultivates vines on his own property, and also learns to appreciate a perfect olive oil.

The tales of the endless string of visitors, some mere casual acquaintances, and some of whom invite themselves to stay, are also told with humour and restraint, though you definitely get the impression that they felt put upon from time to time.

1894,"I enjoyed this fiction account of King Henry VIII's sixth wife, Catherine Parr, and when I saw the author's name is Elizabeth Fremantle I thought her name is ideal for an author of historical British fiction.
This novel focuses on Catherine Parr, and how she coped with being King Henry VIII's wife, knowing that two of his wives were beheaded and that every queen had dangerous enemies at court. Catherine Parr mothered his three children as much as court etiquette and the king allowed her to.
Fremantle shows the romance and the terror of Henry's court, and the terrifying rise and fall of the nobles in his court. Mixed in is the religious fighting between Catholics and the new Church of England, with people being executed on each side, depending on the king's whims and his love life.
Catherine was widowed twice before hoping to marry her beloved courtier Thomas Seymour, when she caught the attention of King Henry VIII, and what the king wants, he gets.

I enjoyed this story, set for a younger audience. The characters are charming, recalling the Namcy Drew era, and the story and secret is interesting. My rating is 4 instead of 5 because first I got a little bogged down with some of the financial data they were reviewing, and second I wasn't overly happy with the computer hacking, especially in a story aimed at a YA audience.

1122,"Stepping back into Haven Point is like having coffee with an old friend.  Its been far too long (over a year!) since Ive been for a visit.

Before I get to the love story in this book, I want to talk about the friendship between Katrina and Sam.  Friends since early childhood, they suddenly find themselves moving along different paths.  Katrina still loves Sam and cherishes their friendship, but shes ready for the next phase of her life while Sam is still into the flirting/dating scene.  The reactions and feelings Katrina has throughout this story are so true to life.  So many of us go through the same feelings as they feel themselves going in different directions from those they are close to and we don't know how to fix things.  The friendships in this series are one of the things that make it so great.

Now onto the main part of this book, Katrina and Bowie.  And Milo.  And Gabi.  I really cant see how anyone could resist falling for Kat.  Shes so kind and patient on top of being beautiful and generous.  All things that are evident before one even gets to know her on a deeper level.  As for Bowie; he has the same characteristics but it takes some getting to know him to see these attributes.  His dedication to his brother, Milo, is enough to make him seem like a decent guy even when hes prickly.

As much as I adore Katrina, her single-minded focus when it came to her goal of adopting Gabi were actually a negative.  It would seem it would be a positive thing to be focused on a goal and not let anything distract from that goal, but when you cant see that there actually are some people who want to help you attain that goal its a problem.  I was so glad when that was finally pointed out to her.

1872,"Curious indeed, and a fantastic read. Imagine a fusion between Alice in Wonderland and Oliver Twist. It's that compelling. And witty, adventurous and clever.

As I was reading about the characters, I had the impression that there might have been another book before this one. Whatever the case, the facts that linked them in the past and how those affected their present situation were being clearly described so there was no detriment to the flow of the story and I quickly became engrossed. Then I realized that what seemed missing was revealed in glimpses into the past in the form of chapters interspersed within the current events, and everything was linked in very interesting ways.

A London steeped in the Victorian era, rich with Dickensian orphans and clockwork machinery, airships and the glorious Crystal Palace as the beacon of all criminal plans. Among thieves and lords, I found fascinating the juxtaposition of Lewis' madeningly creative world and the afmiliar sights and times ofo London. A smart, decisive Alice has escaped her life as a thief for a crime lord who's been kind to her and her sister as children. However, her broken heart obliges her to save a friend and also a lost love who are caught in the middle of foul business with the most disturbing Queen of Hearts I've ever encountered in any book or TV show.

With a gripping plot and a clear, witty writing style, the author has given new, sparkling life to much-beloved characters such as a totally reimagined Caterpillar, the colourful Mad Hatter, the chaming Knave, a surprising Cheshire cat, and Alice herself, a woman of brain and bravery.

I loved the subtle yet strong romance, the convoluted business deals conducted in this delinquent trade that leads Alice and William to a final job that could cost them their lives and souls. I loved the steampunk aura that touched the city of London and its inhabitants, all enchanted with the Great Exhibition. This book is a great story full of creativity, with a clever plot and an increasingly terrifying Queen of Hearts. I'm in love with what could be the first in a series of stand-alones based on other other popular stories we never want to part with. I hope they keep coming. This one is unforgettable.

Verity has come a long way since the first book and I find her to be so much more confident and self-assured then she used to be. I kinda missed seeing Ellis as much, but he teaches Lucy a trick in this book which is just LOL! Love her character! This book was my favorite in the series so far, and, to warn others, it was a little bit darker. Not in a bad way, because there is still a lot of lightheartedness and humor that are present in all of the books, but just a little darker.

I just adored everything about it and couldn't wait to see how Rachel and Jasons story played out, yet didn't want it to be over at the same time. I loved Rachel and Jasons meet cute. I thought the way Catherine brought them together was clever.

Rachel is adjusting to a new life.  And snow isn't exactly her friend.  She has had a lot of life changes in the recent year and she's making the best choices she can.

Situations arose that had these two working together and they did it well.  They had quite the unexpected, eventful work situation that they didn't anticipate but in the end caused other problems.

She was kidnapped only for an empathetic piece where the kidnapping of Summer was concerned, and to hear Beth say, again and again, that she was only found because Summer had someone looking for her... oh my gosh, my heart continued to break for her.

When Beth meets Cade, he's one of the firefighters to show up to her house when she has a stove fire. Her fears of going outside, and the flames in front of her, have her stuck in place. Another firefighter wants to get Beth outside, nearly forcing her, but Cade knows better after discussions with his sister -- and from training as a whole.

I enjoyed Cade's character. He was a great brother to Penelope (with the eyes she and Moose make, I sure hope they have a story someday), a great listener for both Pen and Beth, and never once made Beth feel like she was less than. As much as Beth is embarrassed by her needs and her fears, Cade helps her through them like's it no big deal.

Like Quint and Corrie, I loved the understanding of our male lead. I at times felt that the deep feelings were a bit quick, but it was so incredibly easy to overlook. Beth's coping mechanisms aren't the best, we'll learn, but Cade's understanding, his need to help her (and scold her from a protective stance only)... There's a scene where Cade battles his training and what Beth needs, and it's a scene that is very defining for them as individuals. Cade is a stand-up guy, and as scared as Beth could be, she tried to do what was right. The following panic attack was also incredibly well written -- from both Beth and Cade's stand points.

This couple was incredibly endearing and I loved every moment of their story!

2086,"First, I'm glad to see that this title by Heather Graham is part of a series of books (Cafferty & Quinn). The downside is that there is a lot of background done that will likely help bolster other books in the series. Still, this book can be enjoyed on its own.

Danni Cafferty and Michael Quinn are at the center of this story. She is a shop owner who just lost her father, a collector of odd things. Michael Quinn lived the fast life and loses his life, only to come back from his experience with the resolve to live a more virtuous life. Enter, the bust of an evil man from Roman times that Danni and Quinn must find to save lives. ...and that's all just in the beginning of the story.

This story is written mostly from Danni and Michael's point of view with a sharper focus on Danni's POV. The little shop she has inherited has some odd items, many neutralized by Danni's father Angus. There is paranormal material in the book, enough to satisfy the those of us who enjoy a bit of the paranormal. There is a romance that brews between Danni and Quinn, enough the satisfy those who like some romance, but don't want it to be the center of their reading.

However, even as a Hillary Clinton supporter (for Hillary Clinton to be elected President in November 2016), I must refrain from saying too much more except to say that the whole situation was also complicated by Linda Tripp wiretapping what Lewinsky said without her consent and knowledge of doing so (theguardiandotcom article titled Monica Lewinskys Revenge by Julian Borger dated December 16, 1999).",4,"[-1.9304777945555025, -1.0786884405872073, -1.3245671031309134, -1.0141354159443923, -1.1403649063326444]",-1.0141354159443923
2216,"I haven't read Jill Eileen Smith before, but I enjoy fictionalized accounts of biblical events.  There is, of necessity, such a high degree of subjectivness to these stories, because the accounts in the Bible are brief and scholarly research can only take you so far.  I think the author did a terrific job with her research and portrayal of Sarah and Abraham. Their relationship was a love story and one that, despite their grief at not conceiving children according to their own time frame, lasted through the ages.

The secondary characters of Lot and Melah serve to compare the faith of each family.  Sarai strives to believe in Abram's God and Melah worships the gods of idols.  Ultimately, one woman has her faith affirmed and the other loses not only her faith, but her life.

Abram's strength and unwavering faith were amazing.  I also thought that the portrayal of Sarai's grief and regret over Hagar was well done.  She seems to forget that it was at her own request that Hagar became pregnant with Abram's son.  I loved Eliezer and Lila's and wish there was more to their stories.

Ultimately though, this was a story that had all the right parts and while fascinating and well written, it just isn't going to become one of my favorites.  Fans of Jill Eileen Smith will enjoy it as will those who love stories about biblical women.

I freaking love this book!

Citra and Rowen are two teenagers who get the pleasantry of meeting the honorable Scythe Faraday. No one wants to run into a scythe, much less talk to one or spend any kind of time with one. They have the ability to kill you if they see fit. That is their duty. But Citra and Rowan had the chance to meet this particular scythe and they were both not very pleasant to him. In some cases this could mean they would be gleaned depending on the unpleasantness, but Scythe Faraday was taken with these two individuals and brought them both under his wing as apprentices. Of course neither of them wanted to be apprentices and possibly become scythes themselves. Although there could only be one and it's not the norm for a scythe to take on two apprentices, but such is life.

To be a scythe you have to give up many things, but they are necessary in this new world where there are no illnesses and you do not die. So there has to be an executioner if you will. There are some evil scythes in the book that enjoy the killing and this goes against their creed but everything works out at some point.

I love these characters. I loved them so much. Citra and Rowen are just awesome and Honorable Scythe Faraday is awesome too. Even though he is a killer and has lived hundreds of years, he's a nice man and JUST READ THE BOOK!

Some things happen and Citra and Rowen get separated and are training under different scythes. Citra is under Honorable Scythe Curie and Rowen gets the evil Scythe Goddard <--- I'm not even calling him honorable. He's a twat!

There is a lot more going on in the book and reasons for this that and the other but you can read all of that for yourself.

198,"It's hard to say much about ""Come and Find Me"" without spoilers, but I'll do what I can.  Diana Banks is a computer security expert, working at a company she started with an old friend. Two years before the start of the story,  her husband (also in computers) died in a climbing accident.  Since then, Diana has become agoraphobic, refusing to leave her house, conducting all of her business meeting on line, and seeing in person only her sister Ashley and her friend and partner in the business, Jake.

Suddenly, things begin to go wrong.  Her sister Ashley disappears, forcing Diana to consider actually engaging with the real (rather than just the virtual) world.  And something is not quite right with the business -- her clients seem to be edging away from her.  The virtual world that has shielded her from live people is starting to become a trap that hides the identity of other people from her, potentially leaving her and her business vulnerable to attack.  Diana has to find Ashley and uncover the link between Ashley's disappearance and the attack on her business.

CAFM was a quick read and a page turner.  Diana's computer world was fun, although ultimately not as important to the solution as I might have liked.  The author did a great job of conveying the claustrophobia of the life that Diana had slipped into and her slow grab for freedom, and the way her ""safe"" virtual world became almost a prison.

Lacey doesnt believe theyve arrested the right man and suspects crime lord James Denis is somehow involved.  Can Lacey and Grenville find the real culprit?

There is a wonderful juxtaposition at the opening which informs us of the protagonists past and present.  It also provides readers with a look at the mettle of the man.

The details on the proprietaries involved in Regency daily life are fascinating and a true indication of the period.  The focus on attire, down to the type of knot in a mans cravat, is a study in the outward indications of ones position and status.  But this is no book of etiquette.  The contrast to life in the slums of St. Giles gives the story depth as one is quickly moved into danger and action.

Gardner has created a wonderful ensemble of characters, each of which is fully developed and important in their own right.  They are characters with whom we become involved, and about whom we want to know more.

They story is fast moving and compelling, to the point where this reviewer was so involved, no more notes were made; a bit embarrassing to admit.

A Mystery at Carlton House is a really good read.  Gardner captures the period, and the diversity of characters keeps readers coming back for more.

98,"The Proud Tower is in my opinion Tuchman's best work. Yes, even better than ""The Guns of August."" Writing about the 20 - odd years before the start of World War One, Tuchman explores European society at the turn of the century, recalling the forces that eventually collided in 1914.
As she chronologically moves towards the beginning of the Great War, specific countries and specific social issues are addressed. This works well, and makes for a fast-paced intriguing read. However, Tuchman devotes most of her energies to on the personalities and forces in Western Europe with little more than a cursory nod to Russia and Austro-Hungarian Empire. Turkey, Italy and the balkans are hardly discussed at all, and even then only as they relate to Western Europe. This is peculiar, given the disproprotionate influence these areas had on the causes of the eventual conflict.
The Proud Tower is nontheless a wonderful social history of fin-de-sicle Europe.

545,"""The Midwife"" is a memoir, giving you a peek into life as seen by a midwife in London's early 1950's.  The midwife, J--, was in her early 20's and (essentially) apprenticed in a convent to finish learning how to be a midwife and, to a lesser degree, general nursing. This book doesn't tell you much about J--, but rather focuses on what it was like to be a midwife, tales of the people she encountered, and life in London in the 1950's, which is naturally much more socialistic than the U.S. It touches on J--'s first exposure to Christianity in this convent, as she had been raised not going to church. Also describes the poverty she saw in length. The sad story of how one girl became a prostitute could just as easily happen today.

Some of the tales are heartwarming, others horrific or sad. Altogether well worth reading and interesting. My favorite tale is an uplifting story about a man whom the author calls a ""Holy Fool"" (foolish in the ways of the world, wise in the ways of God). Personally, I think the whole book is worth reading for this one chapter.

8609,"This book starts out with a BANG, and doesn't let up until you read 'The End'.  I will admit, when I read somewhere that Elle was 'seasoned', I thought she was going to be older than what she was. And then when I read that Jackson was 26, I was just a little skeeved out, since I have a 26 year old son.  But those two discoveries were completely forgotten once I started reading the book. And I can say without a shadow of a doubt that Jackson is NOT your average 26 year old.  Not by a long shot. Jackson and Elle were fascinating to read about. They're the personification of Stacy Barthe's 'Flawed Beautiful Creatures'.  I enjoyed their journey of 'just sex'.  They were just what the other needed.

This book had lots of interesting side characters, who had a whole lot going on, but the focus never fell away from Elle and Jax.  The Kim/Kanye and Usher/Grace characters were definitely a hoot.  And Anthony and his mom! Lawdhammercy! Elle definitely dodged a bullet with that mess, lol! I was definitely intrigued by Ezra Carmichael. It was good to catch up with Azmir (*swoons*) and Rayna.

6109,"""When I stopped at the door to Nicoles room, I beheld the sort of scene that lit up my ovaries like a pinball machine.""

I think I spent a good part of this reading experience feeling all kinds of hormonal reactions. Ovaries exploding aside, this story really tugged at my heartstrings. I loved the evolution of characters and often felt a pin prick of tears as Zara and Dave interact and bonded. Over the course on two summers Zara and Dave lives are forever changed.

Zara has always been a spitfire and her strong personality always came through loud and clear. But time and motherhood has softened her. As Dave comes back into her life, she has to learn to take chances that go against the very grain of who she is, who she's become. David Beringer is a sexy and surprisingly sensitive man who elicits strong reactions from women (and girls), and Bowen knows exactly how to convey these characteristics. He's also convinced himself he's not at all a family man, but really his family is just small.

Zara and Dave have an electric connection. When they first meet it's very carnal and most definitely a summer fling. Two summers later, with Dave's Vermont vacation, they face the hard reality that they will be forever linked and that brings me to the true star of the story, Nicole. Zara is a great mother and Bowen channels that into this story. The bond Zara has with Nicole is enough to make me weepy, but my heart fluttered as Dave begins to build a relationship with his daughter and comes to realize what's important in life.

There's a reason why Sarina Bowen is one of my favorite authors and definitely #OneClick worthy  . Both her dialogue writing and storytelling is beautiful.

808,"I was so excited to get this book early, as I'm a long-time fan of Nevada Barr and the Anna Pigeon series. This book is particularly well-written, with Barr's usual ability to evoke a natural landscape. Barr seems to have created a writing challenge for herself: put Anna at a special disadvantage, on vacation with no weapons, out-numbered, with just a few inexperienced women who are young, inexperienced and/or disabled. Some readers might want more background on these women who share the stage with Anna for this book; as usual, Anna's companions (and Anna herself) have obvious faults that can be annoying, and as usual Anna remains her calm, accepting self.

The book takes readers on a fast-paced, wild ride. It's not really a mystery: it's more action and suspense, although the action takes place in the wilderness and it's not really what usually counts as action-and-suspense. The ending is reasonably satisfying although we're left up in the air on several questions.

We still get a sense of Anna's personality and vulnerability. Through flashbacks we see where she is in her life and marriage. But mostly we watch her struggle physically while focusing on a special mental challenge, using every ounce of her background and experience.

There's no reason to give the book anything less than 5 stars because it's so well done. However, I much prefer the books where  Anna operates as a detective in her national park setting, where we get to see Anna's life and her familiar go-to people - her sister Molly, brother-in-law Frederick the Fed, husband the priest, and of course her pets. I understand that the author might want a break and anyway Anna is now a district ranger who doesn't move from park to park as readily. She has adventures when she's on assignment or vacation and I personally prefer watching her on assignment, in uniform, dealing with NPS rules and politics.

And Anna's husband, Paul Davidson, deserves more attention. He's a potentially complex character who's familiar with the vastly dissimilar worlds of police work and pastoral care.

The characters are well-developed and engaging and, in my opinion, this series has got a lot of potential, with the great cast of secondary characters. The hero, Brent Oliver can be a bit of a jerk, cocky and obstinate but he has a good heart. Due to his drinking and partying habits, he has lost his drive, his commitment to winning. And as captain of the Last Vegas Wolves hockey team, he feels responsible for his teams bad results.

Aubrey Shelburne is a professional life coach hired to get his life straightened out and monitor his drinking and training. Obviously, no mean feat! Although Aubrey is a sweet and friendly person, their first encounter is very awkward, Brent is convinced she is a crazy psycho and refuses to work with her. Aubrey and Brents verbal sparring was so much fun. Aubrey has no filter with Brent and he tends to drive her crazy! He fights her on just about everything but he likes that she calls him out on his bad behavior. She is determined, challenges him and is real with him. Their antics were hilarious. Their burgeoning chemistry was obvious and their banter becomes a form of foreplay. And even if they both know that a relationship between them could harm Aubreys professional reputation, they are not very good at hiding their feelings!

Mallory Adams was a tenant of the Boudreaux family when she rented one of the shops on the famous NOLA street.
On a night of untimely dreaming, Mal goes to her shop in the middle of the night to discover that a leak had turned her floor into a swimming pool. Immediately she searches for the landlord, who by chance, lived very close, Beau Boudreaux.

Beau was the CEO of the family company. As the eldest son, he was responsible for all his other 5 siblings and his widowed mother. He had little time for fun, and even less time to have a relationship. But there was something different about his new tenant. Mallory was enigmatic, friendly ... and had a real aversion to touching people.

What no one knew, except for two people whom she considered her family (Lena and her grandmother Sophia), was that Mallory came from a line of psychic. She was empathic (the ability to feel a person's deepest feelings through touch) and could see and speak to dead people.
Her grandmother had been famous for helping the police find kidnappers. Mal scarcely thought that the continued use of this power had killed her grandmother, her only family, so she didn't like to use her powers.

But through the time Mallory's co-existence with Beau's sisters and sister-in-law (Charly, Gabby, Van and Kate) and with Beau himself, in a growing romance, Mallory's powers could no longer be sublimated. And it all gets worse when a person from her grandmother's past decides to hunt Mallory, putting her life at risk in a way that the overprotective Beau could not reach...

Romance, paranormality and breathtaking scenes.

As in, Sigmund Freud.  As Herr Doctor Freud is in the midst of his life's work, he begins a passionate affair with his sister in law.  Is Martha aware of this affair?  If Minna must choose between her sister and her lover, who will she choose?

I have to admit, I was completely swept up in this book.  While Freudian theories are no longer in vogue, I have always found them fascinating, and wondered how much of Freud's personal life factored into his work.  I was fascinated by the descriptions of various medical treatments, both for physical ailments and mental health issues, used during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  It really makes you appreciate how far medical science has come, but also how much we were aware of, even so long ago.  I had to giggle at the scenes about cocaine use, particularly how Freud called it harmless and impossible to become addicted.

I really loved the writing in this book.  As with all historical fiction, a lot of liberty was taken with the storyline, I am sure, but I was really enraptured with Minna and Sigmund's characters.  Freud was really written exactly as I would have imagined he would be, and even though he was infuriating, I was really drawn to him.  But I was really enamorate of Minna as a character.  I love that she really pushes back against Victorian female stereotypes.  She refuses to marry out of necessity.  She drinks.  She is an intellectual.  I would bet anything that she would have been a feminist, despite the fact that she falls prey to Freud's spell.

The book does a great job of weaving both fact and fiction into the overall tapestry of the story.

I wasn't afraid that she would get hurt as she might with a bigger, harder ball such as a basket ball or soccer ball.  We've been having a lot of fun kicking it around the back yard and even just playing catch.  The Nerf foam makes it nice and light but at the same time it has a nice heft to it so it moves quite well and can go quite far when there is force behind the kick or throw.  I really like the holes in the ball that make it very easy to grasp and throw the ball - it works well for younger kids with smaller hands to let them really get a good grasp on the ball. We did have a small (and rather funny) issue of my daughter's foot getting stuck IN the ball a few times when she went to kick it, but that added more to the entertainment rather than really being a problem. =)",3,"[-1.9591719675192607, -1.4116530778452692, -1.1810257100073833, -1.0182545690037863, -1.1935877492060663]",-1.0182545690037863

Anderson's poetic, semi-fairy tale prose perfectly and tragically captures Lia's emotional state, a tortured soul trapped in a tortured body.

However, it seems that Zaslo developed the stories of only a few of these women.  I wanted to read more about the other women in the group as well.  Also, Zaslo himself explains that friendships between women and men are different; perhaps he isn't the best one to document the details of a friendship among women, in spite of the fact that the ""Ames girls"" asked him to write it.

What I got was something much slower, a cautious dance between two people who at first dislike each other but slowly begin to admire each other in their infrequent meetings, and later begin to love. However, I enjoyed the dance very much. The slowness of the relationship made me want it to happen more intensely, and when it finally did, about 4/5 of the way through the story, I was elated. Admittedly, I found some parts before that moment to be a bit dull and mundane, but Jane Austin was a wonderful writer whose wit and flourish kept me going.

Euphoria the story of three anthropologists who wind up spending a brief period of time together while studying a tribe in New Guinea. Nell and Fen are married, but its clear right from the beginning that their relationship is volatile. Fen is brash, selfish and jealous of Nells success in the field of anthropology. Nell, on the other hand, is calm and thoughtful. She values freedom above all else, and would practice polygamy if she had it her way. As you can expect, when Bankson enters the scene, tensions quickly escalate.

The themes in Euphoria are fascinating and intellectually stimulating. It challenges us to wonder, for example, if its truly possible to observe or study anything without imposing our own subjectivity. It forces us to contemplate Nells hypocrisy: She doesnt want possession in her relationships, and yet she speaks about the tribe as if it is hers. It reminds us of the harmful effects of jealousy and power, both inside and outside of a relationship.

Bella Jewel has created her own version of this forbidden relationship so as a fan of her previous work, I was definitely intrigued by her latest release. Step-Lover was fun and entertaining yet intense and dramatic. It included several great qualities of an emotionally charged journey.

Life obviously hasn't been the same for Aria since the accident that killed her father and sister. She is emotionally scarred and is haunted by reoccurring nightmares. The one sliver of recent light was meeting a handsome mystery man and spending an unforgettable weekend wrapped up in his arms.

Blade doesnt believe a committed relationship will ever be in his future. He is just looking for easy flings without attachment. Even with his hard edge and unapproachable attitude, Slade is a nice guy. He just isn't willing to admit it. When the one girl he cant forget unexpectedly resurfaces, the situation is worse than anything Slade could imagine.

The wild ride Aria and Slade experience together is extremely turbulent. Discovering their new connection to one another is very uncomfortable and they don't handle it very well. The tension and angst skyrocket whenever they have a scene together. The chemistry between Slade and Aria is so steamy but they refuse to cross the line. I got whiplash with the constant back and forth from these two. Their wishy-washy behavior is understandable to a point but I felt it was a tad overdone.

Rough Around the Edges had the feel of the movie ""West Side Story"" about it, with gangs and intimidation in the impoverished Cuban community, not to mention the love affair between the rough and tough Alejandro (known as Alex)  and the beautiful, sophisticated, and educated Kristen. Alex is doing whatever it takes to keep the community centre open and Kristen is doing whatever it takes to gain acceptance from the people she wishes to serve.  Alex is deeply immersed in the lives of the boys he works with, even living on the property,  and Kristen goes home to her elegant condo at the end of the day.  Two worlds, different backgrounds, but a common purpose: to make a difference in the neighbourhood.  As so often happens, the people Alex and Kristen were trying to reach out to did not want their help, and they had to use methods of breaking through the barriers that did not impinge on their pride.

941,"""Seabiscuit"" is a lyrical tale broken into three parts.  In the first part Laura Hillenbrand introduces us to the four individuals who will comprise Team Seabiscuit.  There's Charles Howard, the winning salesman who upon the death of his beloved child loses his passion for cars (his son was killed in a car crash) and discovers a passion for horses, and in so doing brings his competitive showmanship to horse racing.  There's Red Pollard who grew up in terrible poverty just as Charles Howard grew up in terrible wealth; his family ravaged by the Great Depression, Red Pollard decides to ravage his body in order to become a jockey and prizefighter, and he brought to horse-racing a maniacal obsession with the sport and deep sensitivity to the marginalized.  Then there's Tom Smith, the original horse whisperer, who was born a century too late, and as his home -- the plains and hills of the Western frontier -- receded he retreated to the only skill he could market to a modern world that no longer had time and patience for his sort of time and patience with life.  Finally, there's the rascally, lazy, and profoundly talented Seabiscuit, who had the speed and the gameness to win it all all along, but who went misunderstood until Howard, Pollard, and Smith found him.

In the second part, we read about Seabiscuit's anti-climactic ego-driven rivalry with War Admiral.  It's the final and third part that makes this book such a lyrical and memorable read.  Severely hampered by age and injuries, Red Pollard and Seabiscuit make one final bid for the Santa Anita Handicap, the richest prize in all of horse-racing and the race that they should have won but lost twice before.  And it's this last part that's non-fiction storytelling at its best.",4,"[-2.3245261978445484, -1.1707930040429488, -1.2499475951223828, -1.0233508317981137, -1.0731991571652362]",-1.0233508317981137

When Chases mom finally had it with him and his bad boy ways, she decided that they should go to her parents place and stay there for a while. Chase didn't like the idea one bit  until he met Nikki. Now, the quarterback football player who lives and breathes a stained reputation had his jaw dropped for Nikki, a sweet cheerleader. The only problem is that: Nikki doesnt date football players. Her refusal to give him a chance made him want her more. When he knew the reason behind her refusal and her inability to trust a jock like him, his determination grew to win Nikki and prove to her that he was different that he was a changed person.

Every character in this book has their important roles. I love the moms  both of them care for their children, despite the fact that the two of them lost their husbands. The twins Brittany and Brett served as very good friends to Nikki and Chase. I also adore Chases grandparents. They support him at the same time understand the phase that he is going through.

Another thing that I loved in this book is that it is written from a boys POV. Indeed, a plus factor. I like seeing the love in his eyes  which made the whole book much intense and more real.

For those people who loves HEA  sorry to tell you, but this book is void with it. The ending isn't bad. If you pay attention to other reviews, it would recommend you to prepare a box of Kleenex and be prepared for the big blow at the end of the story. The end part was perfect to close a heart-wrenching powerful novel.

Death changes a person, especially when you lose someone who was very close to you and served as your strength. Some find it hard to move on with life. When you seem to finally get a hold of your life and then another tragedy strike  one that you don't anticipate and you haven't prepared   just as when you have thought you finally have your happy ending is so much painful. Lacey Weatherford offers a novel that is heartbreaking (for some, to the point of shedding tears) that is about losing someone who meant the whole world to you, getting a fresh start, and moving on with life despite all the circumstances that is thrown at your way.

Triggers: Death
I was given this book for an honest review by Wicked Reads.

Grace is just trying to make enough money to help support her teenage sister, Olivia. They both share the unfortunate parentage of a mom who would rather do drugs and drink than take interest in her children. Gace is practical - she knows that in order to continue having Olivia stay with her, she needs a decent job. While working for a temporary agency, she meets Callan, a hot, Australian who knows how to party and keeps his true self hidden.

Callan is a playboy on the surface but a humanitarian to his core. His only true relationship was with Jack, his uncle. When Jack dies unexpectedly, he rushes to Jack's estate to make sure that his horrible mother, Vicki, can't erase her brother from the earth. Callan runs in to Grace and while cleaning out Jack's apartment with Grace, under the guise that he's helping, finds the one things that he set out to find.

In the midst of the relationship that blooms between Callan and Grace, despite knowing that she shouldn't, Grace takes time to be selfish. In that process, she may lose the only things that she knows and loves. Callan's immediate jump to Grace's defense is sweet and endearing.

I can't wait to see what Claire's story will bring, but I can only hope that Vicki suffers greatly in it.",4,"[-1.1376380841159826, -1.308561865530319, -1.0255192033064913, -1.0235455331172298, -1.2543102635887147]",-1.0235455331172298
818,"My spoiler free review leaves me wishing I could reveal more about Hilary debut novel Elixir. Hilary introduces a great character into the YA genre with Clea. While I couldn't relate to being able to jet off around the world, I could relate to Clea's inner strength, her independence and the drive she has to find answers. Clea finds herself in the middle of a mystery full of twists and dark secrets, as she looks for clues into her father's disappearance. She starts to notice a shadowy figure of a man in her pictures. She learns her father noticed the same thing before he disappeared. It's the same man who haunts her dreams. In each of Clea's nightmares, she sees herself with this man, only they're in a different time periods, and her name is different in each one. Every dream ends the same, in tragedy.

I liked the mystery that surrounds Sage, the mysterious, shadowy figure who's in Clea's pictures and who haunts her dreams. I absolutely loved that when Clea and Ben (Clea's best friends and her dad's confidant), set off on a quest to find answers into her father's disappearance, fate brings Sage and Clea together. As much as I wanted the two of them to acknowledge they both knew each other and had an immediate chemistry, I really liked that Clea at first refuses to acknowledge the undeniable pull towards him.

Hilary Duff has given paranormal a whole new spin. Elixir has a fresh voice, great plot twists and an ending that left me wanting the next book in the series. Though I couldn't get into the beginning of the book like I wanted to, when the plot twists and the love triangle intensify with Clea, Sage and Ben, I was hooked and couldn't stop reading it. A powerful centuries old secret reveals some character twists, uncovers a great mythology and makes for a fascinating plot.",3,"[-2.203229753599797, -1.5161564266594403, -1.1398722587587162, -1.0235627658159652, -1.0629782902930662]",-1.0235627658159652

5 out of 5 stars

This book contains kidnapping, rape, and stalking if any of these will set off triggers please use caution if you read this book.

This isn't the first book that I have read by Ms. Brooks and it won't be the last book that I read by her. This story flows well and the author can suck you in and keep you entertained throughout the book. There are twists and turns to the story that made it unpredictable which I liked. I read this book in one sitting.

Mellie suffers from agoraphobia and PTSD after being violated in the most horrible way while in her teens. Now in her early twenties, shes content with her secluded lifestyle and her cat... at least, that's what she tells herself. When a grandfather she never met leaves her an abandoned house, she has no choice but to set out on a journey she never wanted to take.

Smith Porter was living his dream until he was forced to give up his job as a police officer until his whole family died in a freak accident during a storm since then he hasn't let anyone close. When his old partner calls in a favor, Smith agrees to flip the neglected house and keep an eye on Jay's baby sister.

Hes a master at restoration and rebuilding, but Smith never expected that tearing the walls down around Mellie's heart to be his most difficult project yet. And when her life is threatened, keeping her safe is the most important job hell ever have.
Can Mellie move forward and let her guard down? Will they have a happily ever after?

I highly recommend this book. I hope we get to see a story about Jay and Erik they both need to tell there stories

Not only does Josie have to take care of her uncle, but she needs to settle his wifes business affairs which include a knitting shop.  She has her work cut out for her.

As soon as she arrives, she is made to feel like an outsider starting with her ornery great uncle. Everyone in town makes sure she realizes shes not welcome. They want her sell the knitting shop and go back home to New York City. Josie does manage to find a couple of friends along the way.

However, things take a nasty turn when a dead body is found in the knitting shop and members of the town council make it clear they want Josie to sell the shop immediately. It's obvious to Josie that someone is hiding something and she intends to find out what that something is.

Josie Blair is the newest amateur sleuth to hit the cozy mystery genre and she makes a great first impression. I loved how she stood up to her great uncle and never backed down even when he clearly didn't want her help. In fact, she didn't back down from anyone, not even those who wanted her to leave Dorset Falls immediately.

The pages flew bywell, I read this on my Kindle so the pages were swiped by. LOL I couldn't put this down until I found out whodunit. It wasn't a total shock, but it was interesting to see how the story unfolded.

The author has given readers an excellent beginning to a great new cozy series. Shes given cozy lovers everything they could want  a strong amateur sleuth, mystery and even a bit of humor woven through the story. Im looking forward to another visit to Dorset Falls.

March Lawson, at age 17, was responsible for her younger siblings after receiving a letter stating that her parents had died due to influenza.
At first her thought is that, in spite of her young age, everything would be resolved since her father had left a guardian for her and siblings. But as time went by, everything was turning into chaos.
The guardian vanished and she could not even find out if he had died.
They needed money to live. And as the younger sisters reached the age of marriage, an odious cousin from their father's family asked for the youngest to marry him, but in fact his interest was to take care of their money.
Each sister had a dowry of 25,000 pounds.

To travel to London and to give her sisters the chance to have their time in Season, March needed money. Then she appealed, with a greater enthusiasm, to something that had not attracted attention before. Something that could put her in serious trouble.

Michael Cavensham, the Marquess of McCalpin, discovers through his financial advisors that someone is posing as him and stealing the inheritance of a young lady who has been put under his care. In fact, the person signed Michael's name better than himself!!!
He would personally find out who was doing it and why.
When he meets March, Michael is charmed by her, her tenacity to care for her siblings at all costs - for so long - and her ability with numbers.

But a conspiracy seems to want to ruin March, and now, Michael will do the impossible to protect the honor of the woman he came to admire and love.

Rose lived a rough childhood and all she's obviously gotten a second chance with a loving and wonderful woman who took her in as her own and she's been taking care of Rose like if she were her daughter. Rose just wants to attend NYU and get away from Dallas and start on her own two feet, but her mother won't let her. She's remarried to a british man, that never crossed her mind would be none other than Spider's dad.

Spider has always felt like he never had a dad because his dad has never been there for him. But for some reason his dad wants him to go to Dallas to meet the new family and because according to him, he hasn't seen Spider in six months.

When Spider and Rose meet again, they're both surprised and shocked to see that they're going to be step-siblings.

Rose is too good for Spider and Spider knows that. He's more of a wham-bam thank you ma'am kind of guy and he knows that he can't lead Rose to anything serious because he isn't the serious type of guy. He can't take a girl serious and he loves his lifestyle the way it is. But Rose likes Spider, in spite of his flaws.

Can disaster only lead to these two hooking up or will they let it just go and let their attraction fizzle, if that's even possible!

Hands down, this is Ilsa's best book yet!! It was addicting, it was fascinating it was worthwhile!!

Instead of fun in the sun on a sandy beach, they would be staying at a trendy mountain resort surrounded by snow, and ski slopes. It was the last thing she would voluntarily sign herself up for, which is why her friends have chosen to band together and guilt her into going. Knowing that she doesn't know how to ski, they figure the best way to make her comfortable with this whole situation is to sign her up for ski lessons. They have her best interests at heart, and all think she is in desperate need of some fun, and hope that some fun on the slopes may lead to a opportunity for her to find a little romance too...

Jacob Berkley has recently purchased a trendy mountain resort and is quite pleased with its success so far, and is willing to make sure his guests are treated to the best service possible. While doing his morning rounds he is mistaken for a ski instructor by one of his guests, and while he shouldn't mislead her, he just isn't quite ready to correct her. Something about her intrigues him, so he decides spending one day on the slopes with her can't hurt...

Technically its a stand-alone but youll get a better experience if you read the other books first (especially Until Lily and Until July). This book was funny, sweet, and hot. The characters were engaging and likeable. The story kept me glued to my tablet so I ended up reading the whole book in one sitting.

Jax and Ellie had awesome chemistry. Jax new immediately that Ellie was his Boom but of course Ellie needed some convincing. Jax is seriously hot, protective, and sweet. I know some people don't like the insta-love in stories like Jax experiences but I liked it. Ellie on the other hand, has to be coaxed and pursued by Jax. Her and her daughter (Hope) have been through a lot and shes not interested in anything at first. Of course Jax wears her down and what blossoms between them is nothing short of wonderful. Ellie is a fighter and strong willed but shes also nice. I also loved how Jax interacted with Hope. It was so easy to get lost in the story of these two and I loved getting totally immersed in their world.

This story line is a light easy read which was a nice reprieve for me since I tend to read a lot of dark and/or emotionally heavy books these days. Now don't get me wrong, there was definitely emotion but the book overall has a lighter feel and I absolutely loved it.

Lucas was determined and eventually he took over the title of Mr. FK if you haven't read other ebooks by this author before don't worry you'll understand the joke as you read. But the question is how long will he hold his newly found title?

Lucas is sarcastic and smart and when it comes to the ladies he's a total player but lately seeing his friends settle down, not into romantic lives but in their businesses he's found that he's not quite as happy as you used to be with traveling all over the world.

When the one man he never hope to hear from starts trying to contact him Lucas is determined to keep him away but when one feisty new PA softens him enough to read a letter by the elusive businessman will it be the beginning of not just one but many changes in his life?

Jade really needed a new job and being the PA for an affluent businessman is the perfect fit for her but getting involved in his personal life was not something she ever anticipated especially when it comes to one hunky man by the name of Lucas Reaner.

She is smart in many was but has been burned in the love department one too many times. But as she keep seeing more and more of Lucas she sees the possibility of more for the first time in a long time. But when the secrets of his true relationship with her boss comes to light will it cause things between them two fall apart before they ever really get a chance?

They both know Lucas has secrets with her boss but this time around it's not secrets I get the best of them it's their unwillingness to open up about the possibilities of their relationship.

One of the things I like about how the author works is she build one series and then with the sideline characters another series is created so the people you wonder about you find out in great new ways and you get to see glimpses of past characters. But even if you've never read any of her books you still get a great story because each of them works well as a stand alone. We saw Lucas before and his cocky arrogant attitude drove me nuts from time to time I definitely enjoyed the chance to see his downfall. Great start to a new series.",4,"[-2.5274264393137784, -1.2726359775932474, -1.3680087248874055, -1.0275742924264533, -1.0953722908470127]",-1.0275742924264533

Luca is a pyromaniac and I don't feel it was fully explained how or why that came to be.  I found their relationship to be very intense and although he was always brooding, you could tell that he wanted to help her.  When he finally finds out what happened to her and why shes there, the desire to right the wrong done to her causes him to make a deal that will turn on him.
Allison is very reserved and doesnt trust easily.  After she gives her heart to Luca, a betrayal causes her insecurities and self-doubt to root deeply in her soul.
Part Two brings us to years later when they meet again and the hurt comes back to the surface.  I wanted Luca and Allison to find themselves face to face again.  I was rooting for them to get together, and although they finally do, I wasn't satisfied with the way it happened.  We are made to understand that Luca explains the reason for his departure from the institution all those years ago, but it is never explained to the reader.  I wanted to know what happened and was disappointed that it wasn't shown.
There are misunderstanding adding to drama and characters that want to see them separated.  The secondary characters, like Ollie and Archer added so much interest to the story and I found myself wanting to know much more about them.

After a terrible loss for Trevin Lily signs him up for an audition when he is 18 and he is signed on to a rock band as their new guitarist.  Before he leaves town to tour with the band they take each others virginity promising to keep in touch.  Months later he asks her to come see him in LA and when she does things are very different with him and she ends up leaving.  Over the years they rebuild their friendship and eventually he gets her to move in with him and finish college in LA.  After a couple of years of living in the same house and just being friends they finally decide they can't be apart any longer and become a couple.

She goes on the road with him touring with his band for several years until the lifestyle catch's up with her.  The drinking, partying and drugs are changing her from who she really is.

Jacob not only wants control in the playroom, but outside of it too when he forbids Vivienne to go on a business trip with Alfred.  Vivienne reacts strongly -  his request is unacceptable  -  does Jacob feel threatened - they needed to find a compromise?  Jacob tells Vivienne that theirs will never be a normal relationship, but he craves her desperately;  Vivienne too craves Jacob and wants what he can give her  the intimacy they share is everything to her.  The more illicit the experience, the more she craves it, and Jacob.  The playroom is a powerful release for Jacob - it beckons him;  not only the intensity and thrill, but also the control.  It is time to challenge Vivienne, lead her to higher planes of sensation and so Vivienne outlines a scene she wants Jacob to execute.  Jacobs sense of control produces a feeling of exhilaration, something he has often sought but which was always elusive, but in the throes of an erotic haze, he nearly goes too far with disastrous consequences.  Jacob sends Vivienne away and she is devastated.  Whether Jacob is a danger to her or not, the loss of him rips her apart and she cant live without him.  Coming to his senses, Jacob realises that separating isn't the solution and finally after an emotional weekend, he shares his past.  Vivienne tells Jacob she is stronger than he thinks and her only request is that he doesnt shut her out anymore.  What will the future hold for them now?

He and his wife Beth have recently split up and their daughter, Rachel, is staying with Beth in Missoula.  Their family is in dire straits and Beth takes Rachel with her to live in Texas with a trucker she recently met.  Beth, though not happy with her mother, does not want to speak to Pete.

Pete drinks too much and he knows this.  He has a brother who is wanted by the law for beating up his parole officer and a father who he is virtually estranged from.  Other than Rachel, he is without family.

Pete abhors paperwork and likes to focus on the most difficult cases.  There is Cecil, the boy who runs out of options for foster care.  Even the most generous of homes has kicked him out.  Pete tries to teach him that there is no fairness in life and that he is headed towards a bad outcome in a facility that shows no kindness.  There is also Benjamin Pearl, a near feral child who appears one day in the local school yard.  His father is a disturbed survivalist who punches holes in metal currency and sculpts them in shapes that are bound to evoke strong feelings.  Benjamin and his father are living in a remote camp in the woods and Pete often leaves them vitamins, food, and clothing.

Pete's life is messed up, at least as much as many of his clients.  Each chapter ends with a short clip about Rachel and what is happening in her life.  The reader gets to see things from her perspective.

As AJ and Mason try to just go out on a date and agree that this will not change their friendship but their hearts have a way of talking to each other.  When the date turns into a month then two and then six, Mason feels his life closing in on him.  He has to leave.  He can not do this or be what AJ needs.

Mason thinks he is doing what is best for AJ but in the end, breaking her heart, does not kill her but makes her strong.  She will survive this.  She is not the little girl who lets the guy push her around.  She will get over him in time.  But will Mason get over AJ?  Can Ten handle life with Nine in it?

I wanted to smack Mason so many times in this book but when you get to the end and realize how he looks at love, things make sense.  AJ, wow, her character was so must stronger and has grown.

It wasn't just males in general but her family as well was treated with what bordered on indifference.  I suppose her response would be termed as 'survivor's remorse' in today's vernacular.  She lived and her brother didn't.

Ambrosia is having her fourth season and still hasn't found a man who she can bear to marry.  She was beautiful and had a hefty dowry. She meets the hero, Duncan, in a library while at a ball.  She had gone there to escape her mother.

Duncan had arrived late and had managed to get his attire wet.  He was waiting in the library for his clothes to dry.  He misunderstands her presence and her verbal responses, resulting in a heated kiss shared by the two.  He is a charming scoundrel who has recently inherited his title.

His estate is in need of a large shot of money, and his name needs a large dose of respectability.  A friend recommends he marry a woman of wealth and social prominence.  This was Ambrosia.  And the best way to go about it was to compromise her.

Of course this same friend is a lecherous fellow who has been trying to seduce her for years.  And there is more evil in him than simply that.

The book goes on to show the more or less involvement of Ambrosia and Duncan.  She is attracted to him and they share a couple of heated scenes.  For his part Duncan is attracted to her and discovers he admires her.

There is the usual misunderstanding between the couple and the underhanded dealings of the so-called friend to get through.

If Ambrosia had been written with a lighter touch I would have enjoyed the story more.  She came off as almost less than human and I had little sympathy for her.  The Duncan character was at least likeable though I wasn't all that crazy about him either.",2,"[-3.0775876709458156, -1.0640583069039529, -1.046386728564686, -1.0310305258949597, -1.243701867576053]",-1.0310305258949597

But that maybe easier said than done, since he chose his love for hockey over his love for her, and it broke her heart, and ruined their friendship. Minutes after arriving in town he comes face to face with his girl, when he spots her alongside the road, pedaling a child's bicycle, in a pirates costume... he knows there is a good story there, and if he is lucky maybe she will enlighten him!

Through the years Quinn Rivers has secretly kept tabs on the man who owns a part of her heart, the day he left her and their impending future for a career on the ice she was heartbroken, and unsure she'd ever be able to forgive him for it. But when he shows up back in town, ready to mend fences, and steps up to play a pirate for the day, her resolve starts to slip a little, and forgiving him doesn't seem so far off. He wants to rekindle their friendship, and maybe more, but she has her reservations about the ""more"" part!

Maggie Holloway is reunited with her stepmother whom she had lost contact with years ago. Maggie runs into Nuala Moore her stepmother while attending a friends family reunion.  Maggie and Nuala are excited about reconnecting and having a chance to catch up. Before that happens Nuala is murdered in her home.

Thia book has just enough creepy and some mystery to it. As Maggie is dealing the the tragic loss of Nuala she starts to investigate some odd findings she comes across. Centered around this is Latham Manor.  A retirement type place that Nuala suddenly changed her mind about moving into just days before her murder. Living there also was Nuala great friend Greta Shipley who died shortly after Nuala.

Odd things are going on like people wanting to buy Nuala home. Elderly people also given bad investment information and losing thousands of dollars. Even though I had an idea as to who the suspect was and was correct I still enjoyed this book and glad I borrowed it to read.

I did enjoy the love interest story line between Maggie and Neil. The fact that it was not all mushy and the realization of how things were--feelings was nice. Book was a tad slow but really started to pick up as it got closer to the end. Earl was an interesting person and I can picture people thinking he was odd or eccentric but his family background does make sense to his hobby and interest. Gives the story more of a creepy element.

In the midst of this, young children are disappearing, which has a great deal to do with both Lyra's gift and the Compass she possesses.

The marvelous thing about this book is that it has a wide appeal given that it tells a story on many levels.  For younger readers (those between 8 - 11), it is a story of exploration and adventure with a strong female protagonist; for those slightly older (the 11 - 13 set), the story deals with coming of age, adolescence, rebellion and becoming your own person; for young adults, the parallels to quantum physics and the criticisms of theocracy (and organized religion in general) have appeal.

Emiliya has lived through a terrifying situation.  Within the opening pages of Seducing the Badman, we get to experience the repressive home within which she has lived and from which she has now be relieved. She has known cruelty, rejection, and pain. Now, she perceives uncertainty and confusion, being placed in the care of Radimir.  Radimir was saved from living as an orphan when he was a young boy. Now, he is part of an organization that can make and break those who come in contact with it.  He is a hard man, having been squashed by love in his life. We our thrust into the midst of the Russian Bratva waiting anxiously to see if these two characters can find peace and love in spite of their pasts.

Told in dual points of view, Seducing the Badman was a dark and demanding read that possessed my mind and attention.  Throughout the story, I could feel my heart as it tore in two for Emiliya.  Her hopes and dreams all crashing in an instant with words that cut like a knife. She was made vulnerable throughout the book, but remained one bad as heck female heroine that would allow no one to walk on her. She had backbone, pride, and grit, and she was the ultimate seductress. I could hear her accent and stress on words as she brought those around her to their knees. She made me proud!  I also found an impressive liking toward Radimir.  Although there were times when I became infuriated with him for not doing as I thought he should, he had redemptive qualities that overshadowed his few shortcomings; these characteristics magnified the realistic nature of who he had become.

I love when an author writes a part into a story that I never saw coming. These occurrences stand out and can make or break a story line.  Author Hayley Faiman knows how to do bad. She wrote a scene I have always wanted to see in a book, and did it with such calculated strokes of the pen. It was perfection and added greater depth to the story, creating a great escape.

We Were The Lucky Ones is based on the true story of the Kurc family, as the events of World War II unfolded.  From Radom, Poland, Sol and Nechuma, along with their grown children and their families, struggled to survive during the war by any means necessary.  This book reads more like a work of fiction, but the author's note at the end tells otherwise.  The author chose to punctuate each section of her family's timeline by explaining the relevant historical situations that were occurring during that period.  This layout allows readers the context they need to place the Kurc family in their point in history.

My biggest negative for We Were The Lucky Ones is the length, as it encompasses events from the year 1939 until well after the end of the war.  This does not enable the reader to spend any significant amount of time processing what is occurring and does not tie them to the story.  That being said, We Were The Lucky Ones is a tale of survival and hope during a horrific time in history in history and should appeal to readers who like both historical fiction and nonfiction.",2,"[-1.77118471606809, -1.1185909407893024, -1.1996662385146968, -1.0331329158573146, -1.2533528710911224]",-1.0331329158573146
1812,"This well written history of the end of the late Bronze Age civilizations is part of the Turning Points in Ancient History series, but it can be read and enjoyed on its own without difficulty.  Eric H. Cline is an active archaeologist as well as a professor at Georgetown, and more importantly he is also an excellent writer, able to tell some colorful and amusing anecdotes and sprinkle  humorous asides and observations throughout his scholarship.

In the twelfth century B.C. the eastern Mediterranean world was enjoying a prolonged period of international contact, with goods being traded over a wide area of thriving civilizations, from Mycenae and Crete to Egypt up through Anatolia and into much of the rest of what is now known as the Middle East.  There was plenty of conflict between competing empires, but even battles and long military campaigns increased cross cultural trade and other contacts.  Then, beginning roughly around the year 1177 BC, a series of calamities brought these early examples of globalization to a halt.  There were numerous earthquakes, the climate changed in the form of a prolonged drought, resulting in increased unrest and migrations which led to the invasions of the so-called Sea Peoples, wars over resources became bitterer and more prolonged, and the Eastern Mediterranean entered a Dark Age.  Eventually new civilization centers arose, with new trade products and routes, and the old order was replaced with one from which Western civilization eventually was to develop.

Cline's experience and knowledge of archaeology led him to include many fascinating stories of discoveries, like buried cities and sunken Bronze Age sailing ships, which added color to his narrative.  He does a masterly job of examining different scenarios and analyzing their strengths and weaknesses, in the end explaining that the late Bronze Age came to an end from a general systems collapse due to interconnections which had become overly complex and delicate, so that one small disruption (as in the ""butterfly effect"") could eventually lead to a cascading series of disasters.  This, as Cline points out several times, is particularly pertinent information today as we make our way through the aftermath of a prolonged financial crisis.",4,"[-2.2554937956125585, -1.5602789289717431, -1.0331728010559607, -1.0537318395806354, -1.6851396369983336]",-1.0331728010559607

991,"I heard the author on NPR and the idea sounded interesting so I downloaded the book.  It hooks from the first page and is truly a ""page turner"" -even on an ipad.  Great story with a movie certainly in mind.  (In fact, the author admits it is in development.)  One can almost read the proverbial,  ""Cut!""  The story  blends all the best ingredients - a hero rising from serendipity, a good romance, aliens, a thoroughly bad guy, treachery, space and action.  I've seen this described as a sci-fi action thriller which is pretty accurate.

The writing is unusually mature.  The hero's slow but steady involvement with the powers that be proceeded logically and slowly.  The romance was equally well-timed.  He let the story tell itself without going into a lot of declarative description.  The events revealed the history of the future world where all is close to  being lost.

 ****  spoiler alert  ****  A sense of mystery pervades the story.  Why did the aliens build the elevator?  Why in Darwin?  Why infect mankind with the plague yet allow for a group of healthy survivors?  And why return on their strange time frame and build another?  Are there others still alive that Darwiners have not found?

Problems arise in the translation of elevator construction, design and movement into text.  It reminds me of stories set in space ships with up, down, bulkheads, halls, tubes, etc.  I finally gave up trying to follow the various machinations that occurred along the elevator (rising, falling, detaching, turning, rotating, etc) and settled down for the tale.  The chase scene (for that's what it was) could be cut without affecting the story.  Can't wait until the sequel.",4,"[-2.468041510903531, -1.2205532446916707, -1.0919295714334916, -1.0359192719809873, -1.1242110458415995]",-1.0359192719809873

9913,"This switch works great.  It is programmable to do many things (read online product details for specifics):
-Occupancy/Vacancy, Off/On, Delay
-Automatically on when you enter, off after delay when you leave.
-Manually on when you enter, off after delay when you leave.
-Can be used for a bath fan up to 3 amps.

I am using it for my bath ventilation fan.  It is not on during most times I am in the bathroom.  However, when I manually turn it on for a shower, it will turn off after 30 minutes of sensing no motion.  I have a separate wall switch w/dimmer to control the light in my fan.

Features:
-The delay off has a setting of: 1, 5, 15 and 30 minutes.
-There is also a feature sensing the ambient light in the room and not turning the lights on, if you want that feature.  I didn't use or need that feature for my bath fan installation.
-This switch has a feature of going back on if the timer expires, and you re-enter the room in less than 20 seconds.  This is important to know during you initial tests, that yes, it is working properly.  An example of where this could work well is a conference room with very little motion.  If the lights turn off because of no motion, you could wave your arms and the lights would turn back on.
-This unit has 2 settings for motion sensitivity, so you hopefully won't even have this ""conference room"" situation arise.

General Points:
-The install is quick and straightforward.
-The instructions are detailed and well written.  They will help most homeowners handle this basic task, even if you do not routinely do electric projects in your house.
- Minor point: The small white-headed cover-plate screws thread into the plastic and the plastic is not pre-threaded.  I mention this because, like me, you might initially think you are cross threading the screws, but you are not.  This is a minor point, and if you have no idea what I am talking about it is not a big deal.

This book screamed literature. It seemed like the type of book taught in advanced high school English classes. It had a dreamy mist about it that kept me from becoming immersed in the story. I felt a step removed the entire time I was reading it.

The characters were definitely unique. And yet they seemed quintessionally Newfoundlander. Full of love and loyalty for the sea, and their special rock.

The story reminded me of The Old Man and The Sea. I'm not sure how accurate the comparison is since I haven't read it since high school over 10 years ago, but within the first 20 pages, this is what I immediately thought. If anyone has read both stories more recently, perhaps you could tell me if my comparison makes sense.

However, he quickly throws himself into a murder case at the behest of an old friend and neighbor, Lady Jane Grey, whose former maid, Prue Smith, has been found dead at her new place of employment. Upon examination, it seems that there is much more to Prue's death than meets the eye. While a bottle of poison was found nearby, it was not the cause of murder. And when her suicide note turns out to be a fake, Charles, his friend Thomas McConnell, and those around him begin to look out for the truth.

There are a limited number of suspects in the house: George Barnard, the owner and an executive at the Royal Mint; his nephew Claude, who is surely up to no good; his nephew Eustace, a dour young man with definite political ideas; Newton Duff, a prominent politician; Roderick Potts, a tough-to-crack millionaire; and Jack Soames, an executive at the Pacific Trust.

8576,"3.75 stars---THE HIGHLAND CHIEF is the first installment in Dana DAngelos adult SCOTTISH STRIFE historical, romance series. This is Rory MacGregon, and Englishwoman Lady Darra Berchelaines storyline.

Told from third person point of view using current day and memories of the past, THE HIGHLAND CHIEF focuses on the kidnapping of Darra Berchelaine by Scotsman Rory MacGregon.  Darra and her mother Venora are English healers, and Venora had a previous history with Rorys father. What ensues is the attempted abduction of Venora Berchelaine wherein Darra offers herself up in exchange for her mother. Darra, an accomplished healer in her own right, finds herself a willing captive on a cross country journey that will find Darra and Rory falling for one another while trying to outrun the British Army, local bands of thieves, and eventually Rorys family who despise Darra and everything she represents.

The relationship between Darra and Rory is one of immediate attraction but Darra is Rorys prisoner, and the only person who may be able to save his dying father. The sexual tension between our leading couple is palpable; Darra is attracted to the man who has taken her from her family and home, and Rory fantasizes about the woman at every opportunity. The $ex scenes are intimate and seductive without the over the top graphic erotic imagery.

The world building focuses on the struggles between the England and Scotland; the war between the countries; and the memories that allow the Highlanders to focus their hatred on a people they barely know.  Cross-cultural barriers and a mutual hatred between the English and the Scots proves to be a continuous catalyst for battle and war.

THE HIGHLAND CHIEF is an entertaining and romantic storyline but there are some issues of spelling; typos and improper grammar that could have been corrected with a proper proofreader and editor but he errors did not detract from my overall enjoyment. The premise will captivate your attention; the characters are colorful, sympathetic and spirited; the romance leads to a happily ever after.

8974,"It is really hard to rate this book, because there are things that I loved and things that I didn't care for as a reader, but overall it is a solid book, entertaining and riddled with drama.

The characters created mixed feelings for me.  Bristol is likable.  An interior designer and successful in her career, Bristol is kind and supportive, but she also stands her ground and protects her heart.  There isn't much past this that we know about her, other than her family relationship. This allows readers to like her, but I wasn't invested in her. The character, though that created the most tumultuous feelings is Jax.  When the novel started I hated him.  He is brash and arrogant, but it rang false to me.  It seemed to be a mask for his insecurities versus being part of who he is.  Jax, however did grow on me.  His change as a result of his interactions with Bristol seemed authentic.  This is the Jax he should have been through the whole novel.  I love this Jax.  He is sweet and considerate, and every single time he uses the word love as a term of endearment had me swooning. Even with mixed feelings for the characters, I enjoyed the two as a couple.  It is obvious they care for each other, their development as a couple in light of the details of the story is authentic, and watching them come together is enjoyable.

The plot for me is what I enjoyed most about this story.  It is filled with drama, which I love! What I love most though about the story is that what the reader thinks is going to be the obvious conflict and resolution isnt.  There is a much more intense and suspense filled conflict, and I enjoyed every single moment of this ride!!  Lovers of drama-filled romances will love this story from being to end.

Who can you trust?? To me this is part of what this book is about, as in the story the protagonist, Tracie Tanner finds herself in this tenuous situation. She is only supposed to deliver a letter from Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to the U.S President Ronald Reagan, but what occurs along the way is very frightening. Why would Gorbachev be sending a letter that no one knows the content besides him. Tracie is ordered not to open the letter under any circumstance and as a CIA agent she does what she is assigned to do and protects that letter with her life.

The other part of the book to me is loyalty.
Loyalty
""Faithfulness or devotion to some person, cause or nation.""

Tracie is rescued by a young, air traffic controller, Shane Rowley. He pulls her out of the plane that crashed suspiciously as she was on her way to deliver the letter. Unbeknownst to Shane, he will be on the ride of his life. These two people are both very loyal to their country so they will do whatever it takes to see that the letter reaches President Reagan.

Parallax View takes the reader on the ride of your life. I was around of course in 1987 so I remember the Cold War mostly from movies and books.

Her old crate had a crack in the bottom tray so it was useless for keeping urine off the carpet.  Plus, I recently moved to a new house and needed to move the dog over separately from her pen.  So I needed a functional crate for her.  I went with the 48 inch crate (single door) since she is a full grown Rottweiler (about 85-90 pounds).  There was a bit of additional room for a water dish and toys, and my dog was able to stand up fully, turn around, etc., but not to go wild in this crate.

This crate was the perfect size.  It was easy to put together and it was sturdy once assembled.  (It comes with a divider in case you are training a large-breed puppy.  So you only have to buy one crate instead of a series of larger and larger ones as your puppy grows.  Instead, you can just move the divider.  I am not using the divider since I bought this for an adult dog.)  The door is easy to open and close and the coating on the bars is smooth and unbroken.

In the end, I was really happy with this.  It was exactly what I was looking for.

2215,"Bathsheba, the final book in The Wives of King David series written by Jill Eileen Smith, is the ultimate example of God's forgiveness. Most people know the story of David and Goliath, but how many actually delve into his life as King? I can honestly say I didn't think much about David's life after the defining moment in battle against Goliath, although I did hear Bible stories about his adultery and following misdeeds to relieve the guilt he felt about his sins.

Throughout the book, we first come to learn of the relationship between Bathsheba and her husband, Uriah, who was one of the 30 counselors to King David. It seemed like their relationship was ideal, although they had difficulties as does any relationship. Uriah was often gone at battle and he forced strict adherence to the laws. As Uriah was away at battle for a long length of time, King David decided he wanted to have a relationship with Bathsheba. She did not deny him, and she soon learned she was pregnant with his child. Upon hearing the news, David attempted to have Uriah come back home and incorrectly believe he was the father of the child. When Uriah would not return to his home, David instead sent him to the front lines where his death was inevitable. Upon Uriah's funeral, David took Bathsheba as one of his numerous wives.

The remainder of the book focuses on David and Bathsheba attempting to find forgiveness from God, as well as learning to forgive themselves. Many battles ensue, where David's own sons attempt to usurp his throne, but, in the end, God's will is carried out and the heir God deemed to be King is placed upon the throne.

I really enjoyed this book, and it was the first one I have read by Jill Eileen Smith. I cannot wait to read more of her books in the future, especially the first two books in The Wives of King David series which look at his earlier wives, Michal and Abigail. The format of the book was easy to understand; although I often find stories that are based on Biblical occurrences to be confusing, that was not the case with this book. The characters were well-developed, as I felt for Bathsheba even though I did not agree with her actions.

It is a nice texture and color for our buffet in the fall. It will also be used as a runner over a table cloth a times. As with any jute product there is a distinct scent which dissipates with time and is not at all unpleasant in any case.
This is a nice product with an excellent price.",4,"[-1.8183279071182463, -1.5287772354580456, -1.0728595430182304, -1.0459367732439757, -1.1377300507304156]",-1.0459367732439757

4590,"For the second book in this series, the author tells the story of Callum, a rough, young, homeless man that is known for his street art, and Sophie, the estate manager from an extremely wealthy family. The two could not have come from more different worlds, but are drawn to each other. This is a X-rated, opposites attract love story.

Sophie is drawn to Callum because of his tough, savage nature. As a girl that gets off on pain, she craves the danger that Callum emanates. She's playing with fire when she hires him to be her ""security"" during her hotel room trysts with a Dom that she met online. All the while, she's really just trying to raise his interest.

Finally, her antics work. From that point forward, Callum and Sophie are consumed with one another. Their sex life was hot and  definitely dirty.

Meanwhile, their relationship was growing increasingly intimate. What started out as just sex and physical attraction, quickly morphed into something far more emotional in nature. In no time, the two are playing house and all seems perfect.

Of course, just when things seem to be going perfect, something will happen to mess it all up. Sophie's fear of her overbearing, and highly judgmental, family drives a wedge between them. She does something that opens up old wounds for Callum and nearly ruins everything they built together.

Ultimately, things work out the way I wanted. There is a HEA in store for these two. It all works out nicely in the end.

I really enjoyed this dirty tale. It was surprisingly sentimental. Yes, it was definitely dirty, in an ""eating from garbage cans"", gritty sort of way. However, there is a real compelling love story here, with fantastic characters and a great storyline. If you aren't turned off by a little crudeness and filth, then this book is definitely worth a read.",3,"[-2.1842452274791535, -1.6925451895854473, -1.077180591502831, -1.0519384942132692, -1.0536827047318569]",-1.0519384942132692
572,"Alera is threatened. It's aging First Lord has named no heir--and the major lords grow restless, waiting for a chance to strike, to seize the throne for themselves. Meanwhile, external enemies push the First Lord hard with continued storms that sap his strength and make him less able to respond to hidden threats. And there is a hidden threat. An alien race has taken root. With its ability to take over the bodies of its victims, the alien swarm-race intends to rot Alera from within--and then to take over the entire world. Against these forces stand only the aging First Lord, his page Tavi and Tavi's two best friends and fellow students, and Tavi's aunt and uncle. Tavi's uncle must confront one nest of the alien vord while Tavi's aunt races to the capital for rescue--only to find assassins, with the First Lord in no position to help.

Author Jim Butcher creates a fascinating alternate Earth--a land where the forces of nature are personified into beings (Furies) of power that certain humans can call upon, and a land where scholars cast scorn on any who believe that civilization was even possible before the discovery of the great furies. The power of the furies has stiltified scientific progress and war is still fought with legions, sword, and spear--along with magic.

Tavi, in particular, makes a vivid character. His school traumas, made worse by the absence of any Fury talent whatsoever, provides a backdrop on which the greater political struggle takes place. Butcher's military scenes ring true, with legions going up against alien bugs, and with Tavi's uncle, Bernard, wrestling with his failure to protect the very people he is sworn to serve. I found Butcher less convincing with his female characters--Isana (Tavi's aunt) being whiny and annoying and Amara (Bernard's lover) not much better. The mysterious Kitai is a welcomed exception, being an intriguing and capable female.

ACADEM'S FURY is compelling reading--and Butcher's smooth writing, strong world-building, and continual danger and adventure, add up to an addictive mix.",4,"[-1.9363028732233416, -1.8420114636788583, -1.1888976856151796, -1.0530536840390132, -1.0954628144805]",-1.0530536840390132
