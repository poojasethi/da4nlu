First off, the writing wasn't bad, but there were quite a few mistakes. If there was an editor, they clearly did a poor job.

Secondly, the characters weren't anything to write home about. Lyric is naive and boring. She claims to want to be a senator but she spends more time sleeping with inappropriate men than she does doing anything revolving around her ambitions. Royal is very stereotypical and macho. Nothing he did impressed me. Lyric clearly put up with far more than I would have from him. I didn't really see any chemistry between them. The sex scenes were average--definitely nothing hot enough for me to rave about, like some of the other reviewers.

The plot was boring. The author tried to cook up plenty of suspenseful plot devices, but it actually came off contrived and kind of silly. Lots of backstabbing and double-crossing and violence for the sake of violence.

The third issue was the fact that the slow cooker was never capable of fully cooking the food placed in it. My wife cooked chicken breasts, but after the suggested time was reached, the chicken pieces were still raw in the middle.

In the first book, Dons quirkiness (somewhere on the Aspergers Spectrum) was a major player in the book, but it wasn't the only player.  The other characters seemed to have more to contribute.

In this book, Dons behavior seems so forced and so contrived.  Every single thing he says and does is tainted with his quirkiness, to the point of absolute annoyance.

For example, a woman is about to breast feed her baby.  Here is the quote from the book:

The discussion was interrupted by the arrival of a nurse carrying a baby which I assumed was Sonia and Daves.  I was well aware from the Antenatal Uproar that social convention took precedence over maximizing immunity through the sharing of breast milk.

Sonia commenced the nutrition and immunity-improving process.

That last sentence was just annoying.  I cant see Don looking at every single thing like this.  I just don't remember the first book being so constantly over the top like this.

So I watched this movie.  And I have no idea what I was supposed to like about it.  Cool cars, okay.  But after about ten minutes of watching non-actors doing some non-acting (except for Warren Oates, who, well, drives a lot), I could not figure out what I was supposed to like about this movie.

I also grew up watching movies like VANISHING POINT; DIRTY MARY, CRAZY LARRY; CANNONBALL (not THE CANNONBALL RUN); AMERICAN GRAFFITI; heck, even SMOKEY & THE BANDIT...and those may have been cheap drive-in movies...but they at least DID SOMETHING.  Characters, plot, dialogue, gags, stunts.  Low-brow and obvious, but I didn't scratch my head and wondered what the heck was even going on like I did suffering through TWO LANE BLACKTOP.

I went into this book expecting a new fantasy series to enjoy, and instead got served a watered-down Chronicles of Narnia. I dislike ""Christian fantasy"" in which everything is too obvious of a Christ metaphor and there are too many lessons to be learned. I wasn't expecting that with this, which is what made my dislike all the stronger.

There's nothing technically wrong with it, so if you're fine with Christian fantasy, you may enjoy it. Just be aware that that's what this is: religious fiction.",1,"[1.838491750079413, 2.1951748155204003, -0.5549782426440149, -1.0381668773328443, -1.8340760057271912]",2.1951748155204003

5557,"Apparently this book follows in the great French tradition of large books.  Unlike some of those large books, this one I had a hard time getting into.  I admit that I honestly was confused from the start and that helped nothing moving forward.  There are too many non-moving parts at the beginning.  Too much background without plot.  The one thing I can attest to is that the research has been done on the author's part based on the extensive bibliography at the back.  Maybe part of the problem is that this is a translation and something is being lost for me there.  The sentences are short and choppy in construction at times which meant I skipped over whole sections without realizing it and several pages later wondered, briefly, what I missed. I also found that I could not keep the characters straight for very long.  Too many of them with names that were too unfamiliar for me even with the help of the glossary at the back.  Had this been a straight nonfiction narrative, I think it would have worked better for me personally.  The fictions of the story just aren't doing it for me.
After the second attempt at reading this, nothing was much better.  To me, this book just needs the right readers to find it.  I like my action and plot to begin when the writing begins, not halfway through the process.  The Prologue was interesting despite the fact I had no idea who ""he"" was half the time since that was a constantly shifting pronoun.  I guess I just needed more clarity at times.  But then the first chapter started and the whole experience just fell apart.  So, this one is probably more for fans of slow moving character pieces than the plot and action driven narrative.  Also worth looking at if you're really interested in the time period as it is excellently researched, if not as well executed as I would have liked.",1,"[0.7416572849838048, 2.1800234287759483, 0.026705523050717384, -1.028129112114548, -2.258781638628296]",2.1800234287759483
8775,"As a huge fan of Entangled Publishing, I am always thrilled to receive an ARC e-book from them via NetGalley.  Unfortunately, the gamble I took in requesting Gambling on the Bodyguard did not pay off.  My romance book-loving friends, the author simply tried too hard on this one.  Instead of a realistic romantic tale, it came across overly sentimental with its at times stilted/overly drawn out dialog and the too frequent, overly long, sometimes even weird, racy scenes which hijacked any hope of an actual storyline. The weird comment is directed at the use of bacon and syrup, by the way. Throw in the too unlikely coincidences regarding the heroines occupation (ski instructor) and the circumstances surrounding the heros sisters death, which he blamed himself for, and I was ready to bail about 40% into it.

Wait, theres more.  The heros constant I want to be with you but you deserve someone better than me felt too sappy and redundant for this reviewer. O.K. Thats enough. There are a few more things I could mention, but I think you get the point. Since I don't like writing critical reviews, it pains me to be so brutally honest, but thats my job.  To give an honest, unbiased opinion in exchange for this ARC generously provided by this great publisher.  Unfortunately, this one just didn't work for me.

Do yourself a favor.  Consider reading Book 6 of this series, Tamed by the Outlaw by Michelle Sharp, instead. I do highly recommend that one.

This book was better than the first in the series. However, I have to say, David, toward the end of the book and the stuff that went on with his ex was soooooo dumb. Like, beyond dumb, I considered dropping this book a whole star because of it.  I didn't even start to have any problems with the book until then.
His sense of obligation even when he has no feelings for someone is quite unrealistic IMO and just plain.. as I said... stupid.
Also, in the beginning of the book David and Raymond discussed their fantasies of what they really got off on... and wanted to do sexually. We sorta saw them fulfilled but not. Because one of them wanted to screw, be filled, then return the favor. I was very disappointed that wasn't written at all.
So between David's relationship and major overthinking issues... and Raymond's lack of motivation there were parts of the book that drove me crazy.
However, that's how people are in real life and I can appreciate that aspect of the story. The sex times were hot. The building of friendship and then relationship was nice.

In this book I found the hero too much of a villain and the female lead too weak to walk away.  Alpha heroes are great, but not when the women around them are shown as bodies to be used without much backbone or self esteem. Enough is enough.

The prologue was great, and many of the flashbacks to Locke's childhood were interesting, but the rest of the novel was not good. The book is based on one big scam that Locke and gang are planning on a nobleman, it comes to fruition pretty early in the novel, leaving the other 3/4s of the book to throw problems and trouble in Locke's way. In addition to the plot not keeping my interest, the writing style was strange. An event would happen, then we would have to go back in time and read about how it happened, just to pick back up at the event happening. An event would happen, there would be a twist, then we have to read about how exactly the thieves accomplished the twist. Just explaining the twist was enough. I really wanted to like this book, I could have given up much earlier but since I spent so much time on it I felt compelled to finish. This book is mostly dialogue, but the characters weren't interesting enough for me to enjoy that. The capers weren't funny, fun, or exciting. In my opinion, a failed attempt at something that could have been good. If told a little differently, and rearranged a bit, this book would have shown promise.

337,"It seems I am the lone voice here because this novella did not work for me and certainly wasn't 5-star-worthy IMO.  But let me say up front that perhaps that is because I had not read the books that came before and therefore I was struck by the strange parts of the story that didn't get resolved (won't put in spoilers but I am referring to all the stuff that happens to Eli's family...)  So my first recommendation is not to read this as a stand-alone because it just doesn't work unless it's a continuation of some other story.  Quite apart from that aspect, I found both H and h unbelievable:  adult platonic ""friends"" sharing a bed regularly  and being so involved in each other's sex lives felt both tacky and immature.  Then came the last 1/3rd of this novella which was just a bunch of sex scenes.  Don't get me wrong, I have no objection to sex scenes but they are usually more interesting when they are part of a  plot and/or there is a plot-related reason they are included.  At first it was interesting but I kept wondering where it was leading and the answer was nowhere that hadn't been made clear between H and h, before they eventually fell into bed together.  So, it just felt like padding.

When I tried to push it down into the area it was supposed to go, it wouldn't fit. It wobbled and slid off. When this black ring fell to the floor upside down, I saw two little rubber prongs on the underside. Then I saw the holes on the metal base where they fit into. Perfect fit and rubber ring stays put. I still don't understand why the ring is higher on two sides and lower on the other two, Perhaps this is how it keeps the paper towels from unraveling. One handed? Yes, sometimes one sheet at a time. Heavily weighted? Yes. Even the cats can't head butt it off the counter. (Yes, they pushed the other one).  Best of all, it matches my stainless steel and black kitchen.

I know it was very popular at the time, but it still is really awful.  I had a difficult time sitting through the whole thing, and it was rather sleep inducing.  I wanted to see at least one of the Friday the 13th films, so I watched this one.  Many of the murders were ripped off from Mario Bava's superior Twitch of the Death Nerve (aka Bay of Blood), so the film wasn't even that original.  As we know, there were roughly around 1000 sequels, 500 TV shows, Jason dolls, Jason's official murder tools, Jason's hockey mask, etc., etc..  The film was one of the biggest hits of 1980, the year Hollywood started to decline.  Coincidence?  Who knows?

9416,"One of the other reviewers compared the movie to a combination of Legally Blonde and Revenge of the Nerds.  That is pretty accurate.  Fans of Anna Faris know that she has very good comedy acting chops (from the scary movie franchise and Waiting).  She is definitely not afraid of saying or doing something totally stupid and ridiculous.  She pulls off the ditzy Playboy Bunny, with a kind heart and smarter than she seems quality very well.  There is definitely not a lot of depth to the character she was trying to play, but what depth there was, she played it well.

The movie has mix of stars who have become A list or B list (mainly Emma Stone and Kat Dennings which the movie did an awesome job of making look plain and downright unattractive respectively before the ""makeover"") with reality tv stars, musicians and lots of cameos from celebrities.  Even though it was not meant to be a movie that was going to win the actors any awards, the fact that at least some of the stars had the ability to act made it as good a movie as it is.  It is definitely not a movie designed to make you think, and it is definitely making fun of the whole fraternity/sorority culture.  It did not try to do too much and pretty much stuck to the comedy that it was meant to be.

This is not a movie that will appeal to everyone.  It is for the most part a mindless comedy that is not meant to, or try to make you think very much.  It had a lot of cute girls in skimpy outfits and/or showing lots of cleavage.  If that is not the kind of movie that entertains you, skip it.

And goodness didn't he recover from his alcoholism quickly - only a couple of weeks in rehab and it's all better, can't remember any liver damage mentioned, and the problems with his family virtually disappear after a few ""sorry"" words.

The alcoholic is, of course a billionaire and so gorgeous that the counselor takes one look at him and throws her reputation and job to the winds, risking her whole career and future study. There's sex everywhere, even on the stairs - can you imagine anything more uncomfortable?

58,"My review is based on my purchase of the CD.  As much as I wanted to give 5 stars for the content and insights, the reader was so subpar that I could not.

Advertisers have known all along that economic decisions are often heavily based on social, cognitive and emotional factors.  We can know too.  Author Dan Ariely gave incredible insights into ways that people commonly make irrational decisions.  Sure they were based on college experiments, but we learn a lot about ourselves from the results and Ariely's interpretations.

From knowledge gained studying irrational decision-making, I wonder to what extent we can rationalize behavior.  It seems the complexity of decision-making might be increasing, and the irrational biases are apparently hardwired.  For example, even though we know based on Ariely's research that we put energy into being penny wise and pound foolish regarding certain purchases, it seems likely that smart people will continue to do so.

The solutions posed in the book are really separate from the value of the knowledge gained.  Obviously, government has a legitimate role in consumer protection.  Consumers, working constantly and with no time to research the fine print of every type of deal, should be protected to some extent.  Even so, there is no way government can protect citizens from every pitfall.  It makes me wonder if a type of training could be devised to help me, and all of us, override most irrational impacts on decision-making.",3,"[1.7500910192214658, 0.26718958505560175, -1.228877345686223, -0.9843915701907385, -1.2412345914497651]",1.7500910192214658
1609,"I was annoyed and frustrated through 80% of this book. The reason is, that by my standards, the author does not play fair with the reader. Here are two examples. The book opens with the protagonist having a breakup fight with his girlfriend. Some of the characters in the book know the reason for this fight and how it relates to another incident, known by almost all, they discuss but which is held from the reader. Instead, they make oblque references to both.

This leaves the reader ignorant but the books players informed unlike, say, an Agatha Christie novel where the reader is invited along to solve the mystery with the protagonist and both parties having equal information.

Then again, this withholding of information results in a final 20% that has an enormous impact on the reader. Ive rarely read a book that has this much power, excitement and satisfaction in the wrap up. Its plainly masterful. All the loose ends get tied, plot get mysteries solved and were finally clear or at least less muddled if were reading a thriller, a mystery, a horror novel or a supernatural tale. I wasn't sure until the end and, in a way, still am not.

Another issue is that the protagonist isn't likable  even in the least. By the end, many will have sympathy for him while others will detest him. Im in the latter camp, but I do understand the fellow maybe more than I wish to.

I can recommend this book without reservation, but wish the author would have somehow avoided creating that sense of annoyed frustration I had through a good deal of the books length. Ill leave this off now to comment that in the evening and days after finishing this book, I was enormously gratified that Im married to my fantasy babe.

The action and the thriller part were practically non-existent.  There were several opportunities for great action, but they were spoiled by the author skipping the action part and having the characters mostly describe what happened.  I WANT TO READ THE ACTION!  The main character had potential.  But this potential didn't develop because I was so distracted by the comedy that the author tried to insert and that fell totally flat for me.  I was also distracted by the romantic shenanigans by several of the characters.  I mean really, characters meet, fall in love, and plan to marry all within this ""action thriller""?  And thriller?  I think NOT  I definitely wasn't thrilled by any of the action, character development, or plot.  I was not invested in the characters.  I didn't worry about them being in peril.  And really!  Cold Mountain?  This nickname for the main character got REALLY annoying!  Will I read this author again?  Not likely.

4930,The concept of this book caught my attention and reviews said hot steamy sex.  Hmmm.. Not sure what others consider steamy but it was more like a slow burn. He was crude and showed no feelings. It was a wham bam every Wednesday. He hit it and quit it. Yes their secret rendezvous were taboo especially the day of the funeral but after a year - kinda made no sense to keep it hid. Felt author tried to make it an issue after that long.  This book could have really been a hit if the story had developed the characters a little more.

I didn't find any of the characters to be particularly exciting and on a scale of one to ten as far as the sizzle factor between the characters I would give this a one. The setting is pretty cool and kind of quaint and cute, but unfortunately I found the setting more exciting than the characters and the plot. I don't think I will be reading another one of these books any time soon. The worst part of this book for me, was that there was really nothing happening in it that made you want to go on.

8698,"This was a typical (new style) regency romance with sex and terminology that might not have existed in that era and the old terminology, arse was combined with newer terminology, cock. The non-virtuous heroine was lucky not to be pregnant from any of her (two?) encounters. While the claim was that there was only one in the past, the language and the descriptions strongly suggested that there were more....The grammatical and spelling errors were relatively few but quite notable, as neckless instead of necklace. It was not made clear how the poor heroine got money, except vaguely from her uncle--it would have taken only a few words to clarify it. It was very predictable. I knew what was going to happen. Overall, not a horrible read, but unless and until there is a thorough edit, I won't read another in this series....and I was really in the mood for a well done regency romance.

I've mentioned in my review of ""Tusk"" that I've been a fan of his movies for over a decade and I have all of them and like re-watching them often.  But his work lately has just gone downhill.  Watching this movie wasn't funny, it wasn't action packed, it wasn't scary, it was just messed up.

The movie is always either disturbing or boring, or completely predictable.  I don't know what Kevin is trying to do with these movies that he's making these days, but he really isn't making good movies anymore.  Maybe he just just go back to the Jay and Bob movies, or even try writing comics again.

--I now call dibbs on Slade, Cale, and Hemy!! They are MINE!!--

A man lost in his own darkness and who uses sex as a weapon to drive away his demons.

A woman with a secret who just might be the remedy he needs to see the light.

She's different than other girls. She's more than just a f*#ck. She's addictive, but the right kind of addiction.

She makes me want to be a better man; makes me want to be the old me.

Because I love it when you touch me, It makes me feel as if I'm breathing. Makes me feel...alive.

Can she be the salvation to his darkness? Will Slade overcome his past and fight for his future? And with parties breaking down all of their own rules and barriers, will their romance take flight? Or will hinderances deter them to ultimately walking away to the walk of shame?

Read and you will find out!!

He's like an addiction. Everything about him just calls out for me; my body needing him to survive.

It was unstoppable and I knew I was screwed in the best way possible. I wanted to know more. I wanted to help ease your pain. I wanted to cure you.

This man completely owns me...I am almost willing to give him everything; not just my body, but my heart.

My thoughts: It's like how I said in the beginning. This book was a fast and easy read and just captured my attention through and through.

The only downfall though is, since it is a novella, it didn't have a whole lot of plot. Otherwise, it was over all an extremely satisfying read and looks like to be a standalone for this couple I think.

I don't re tell story lines in my reviews, and for good reason regarding this book... because, I don't know what I'd say?
It could be that this read was WAY outside my genre, which I will readily agree, since the only reason I picked it up was due to what I considered it to be the best choice of October's reads as a Prime member. In the aftermath, all I can say is ....OK, I won't say it again.
I read a lot, most notably police and legal thrillers. I'm not a fan of psychological thrillers and that is probably why I didn't get this book. I can appreciate the comments of the other reviewers, that delve into this genre, but even after reading those I still could not figure out what this book was about. I read it. Every page, hoping that somewhere along the line the story line would open up to me, but no dice.
I thought at first that I would not even pen a review, but after shaking my head some, decided to do so.
I gave it 3 stars, but honestly, had 2 stars stated ""didn't get it"", in stead of ""didn't like it"" I would have done that, but otherwise considered 2 stars to be unfair.

In a land where they're doomed to be roasted to death, they show optimism. They build a plane ,dance aroud to radios that appear from nowhere. There are many loopholes to this plot. It didn't seem that the moderate sized plane that crashed in the desert could carry as much as load as they somehow bought out of it.

906,"It probably goes without saying that writing good parody is very difficult.  How closely do you follow the source material?  Should the humor reference the original, or should the parody be humorous and entertaining on its own merits?  And what's the point anyway?

Bored of the Rings, first published in the late 1960s, takes on one of the most popular and beloved works of fiction in the English language, J.R.R. Tolkein's Lord of the Rings trilogy.  The Harvard Lampoon authors stick close to the original story, compressing it while squeezing in lots of silliness.  I was reminded of the old Mad magazine parodies I used to read (although those were done in comic book format).  The final product is sometimes funny, but comes across as a bit stale and dated.  I think Bored will best be enjoyed by fans of the Tolkein's books and the movies, probably not so much by those readers not familiar with the original story.

9397,"the film and the extra scenes fail to make mention of what became of the son?  Did he finish college? Is he happily living with a family of his own?  Does he work for his dad, or what?

He was a central figure afterall.  I didn't read the book, and maybe this has been addressed by someone in the other review postings, but I find it odd that the real son was left out of the ending.  This movie would not have been made if it did not have the son figure.  Did he not want to participate and why?  I fear that maybe he and his dad had a falling out.  That would be incredibly tragic and put a damper on the story.

As for the movie, my lower than average rating is because I found the movie to be sooo depressing.  A good drama builds to a climax where the action requires a ""drop-dead"" event, decision or encounter, then a resolution.  Here, 90 percent of the movie was at a climax stage.  It was one horror after another.  Okay, maybe that was the real life, but I needed a break-a few actually.  My wife and I agreed that we were glad to have not seen this at the theater as it would have been too draining.  Also, the resolution was nice-although expected-but, the movie almost immediately ends.

The premise of the story was silly, there was no snappy dialogue, no interesting descriptions, no compelling --and generally believable-- plot.  Instead we are treated to the most ridiculous story ever.  I am willing to suspend my disbelief when reading historical romance but this was so far out of the realm of the believable that it felt as if all restraints were off and the author was just writing whatever, with absolutely no effort to keep within even broad parameters of historical accuracy.  The story was unbelievable, the Hero came across as ridiculous and the heroine was a cardboard figure who was TSTL, and marched through this embarrassingly unlikely story with little real charm or anything to make the reader empathize with her.

7637,"So I recently bought a projector so that my wife and I can watch movies outside on our deck and the thing came with a tiny speaker built in. So when I had the chance to try out this Bose Soundlink I jumped at it. In short it sounds amazing and I recommend it if you are looking to spend $300 on a speaker.

Here's where it shines:
1. Bluetooth: the wife and I have android phones and we were both able to pair our phones to this speaker with little trouble and start playing our music. The music was clear and really sounded pretty amazing.
2. Battery: this thing has an internal battery you charge via the included AC adapter. I am not sure how long the battery is supposed to last, but in my testing I used it for over 5 hours and never had a battery issue.
3. AUX input: the projector I bought doesn't support bluetooth buth this does have an AUX input so I was able to plug in a cable to my projector and then to this speaker and it allowed me to play the audio through it, the movie came to live and this was great as that meant I didn't need a power cable thanks to the internal batteries.

Where it falls short:
1. Cost, While it sounds great at $300 it's on the high end of the cordless bluetooth speakers available today. It is VERY good, but it comes at a premium cost.
2. Protection: This speaker doesn't have any type of protection. Previous generations of this speaker had a cover that was built in. This one does not, although you can buy one from bose for an extra $35. Really? If you are already spending $300 for a speaker the least Bose could do is give you a standard case/cover for it. Because of that I am knocking off one star.

All in all, if you have $300 and like Bose you won't be disappointed with this speaker. It's clear and both music and movies comes to life when played over this speaker regardless if it's via bluetooth or a cable plugged into the AUX input jack. I really like it.",3,"[1.5577644908801125, -0.5476058979639677, -1.0002045645831896, -1.0227677918255818, -1.608900516766762]",1.5577644908801125

The problem for me on this one is a couple things though...1) the downshift from Jace wanting to be this no strings attached, all fun, not commitment player to this totally consumed, totally dedicated boyfriend happened way too fast for me.  That could have been drawn out a bit more to show the transformation that Avery had on him.  Other than that I think that everything else was waaaaaay too drawn out.  This could have been 200 pages shorter and still been really great and gotten the same message across.  I felt like the book could have ended like 2-3 times and then I look down and am only at like 65-70%.  The last 15% of the book was totally not needed and could have all been wrapped up in a short epilogue.  I used to be a HUGE Toni Aleo fan and Taking Shots is still one of my all time favorite books.  The thing that has steered me away from her over the years are these almost 600 page books that just go on and on with no real need.  Last, **TINY SPOILER ALERT**, I actually felt like this book was too similar to her previous book Taking Shots.  In fact the scene where we find out who her dad is could have been practically plucked right out of Taking Shots.  The insecure heroine, the heroine having the horrible verbally abusive family, her hiding secrets about her past from the hero, and I could go on and on are all way too similar.  I feel like Toni's books try to drag in too much plot line instead of digging into the main storyline.  Overall, not a fan.

So I know, if I see her name associated with a book that I am going to read it ASAP and I know I am going to love it! The degree of love changes a bit with every book some I obsess over and cant wait to either reread or hope and pray she comes out with another book that is connected to these people that Ive fallen for already. I know, I shouldnt be so partial to a particular author but once youve read an Emma Hart book you will get it!! Prepare yourself, because Miss Fix It is a book that I NEED more from!! Im thrilled to see an upcoming Miss Mechanic book in December! I have found that her RomCom books addict me the most they are so funny so swoony so heart-warming so darn hot and sexy that you will NOT be able to stop reading! Im warning you all now!

Brantly didn't stand a chance after he had one look at Kali! I mean, we have a woman who can fix anything! Talk about a total role reversal! I loved how passionate she was about working with her hands. She loves her job. No Brantly had his work cut out for him in getting Kali to fall for him! She loved his twins almost immediately how could she not?! But Kali wasn't in to dating her clients and she didn't want children. Brantly had two strikes against him going in. He worked her over though!

Yall have to read this one! Its such an entertaining and engaging read! Emma Hart pulls you in with her perfect writing! She writes such a fun story! The banter the main characters had was so great! The sass Kali emits is so darn amusing! Her sassy, snarkiness is her tough exterior for that big soft heart she hides inside! This is one funny and sexy story that you don't want to miss! #OneClick this bad boy now and enjoy a fun night of witty banter and sexy heat!",4,"[-3.095283388764561, -2.8060758201581133, -2.2980921180199285, -1.0255517207415286, 1.5161139220571338]",1.5161139220571338

1167,"I was really excited for a new David Levithan book. I've read several of his previous novels and have always enjoyed them immensely. I was intrigued by the writing style, very personal with lines crossed out and rewritten all over the pages. The photos interested me, as well. They seemed peppered throughout the novel, obviously heavily tying into the story.

I was, ultimately, extremely disappointed. To be honest, I couldn't even make myself finish the book. The writing was disjointed and strange (but not in a pleasant manner). It was actually frustrating to read through the crossed out portions, then read the ""correct"" portions. It threw you out of the story instead of sucking you in. The pictures didn't really help along the story, but seemed to just confuse the plot and muddle the story. The characters were boring. The main character wasn't anyone I could enjoy reading about. There was a ton of needless angst that wasn't at all fun to read about. Some authors can pull off angst without making it a chore to read. This book is not of those.

I will read David Levithan books in the future, but I'll definitely be more cautious about trying ""new concept"" books. The premise is still interesting, as well as the overall concept behind the book, but it was poorly executed and ultimately unenjoyable.",1,"[0.417993975494509, 1.5062268104305527, -0.39697039101652676, -1.0273117052141338, -1.6176735932047128]",1.5062268104305527

I started out really looking forward to the story, and it was certainly inventive. On the whole,I didn't understand the diagrams, but perhaps they added to the story for some. Taking into account that it's fiction, I'm willing to suspend disbelief...... To a large extent but eventually became too bizarre. Also, the stamina of the lead characters was totally unbelievable, think super girl on steroids. She never slept or even slowed down and even without rest her brain was beyond MENSA capability.

2026,"When I first began this novel, I was a little disheartened to think that it might be similar to Klassen's most recent novel, The Girl in the Gatehouse, but I soon found that the similarity was just that, a small similarity. From the novel's beginning, I felt totally pulled into the story. There was such a depth of sacrifice and a tangible quality to the emotion in the story, but none of it was overdone or too dramatic. From what appears to be a setting and a situation that was devoid of hope, Klassen created a powerful story of love and sacrifice.

It's obvious that Klassen made researching for this novel a top priority. Having never read anything about wet nurses or a novel that deals directly with the life of unwed mother's during this particular time in history, I found all the detail to be engrossing.

The plot was steady and realistic. It held my interest the entire time. Just when I thought I knew what was going to happen, a new circumstance would appear, but it all felt natural to the flow of the story. In a genre that has issues with predictability, Klassen kept me guessing the entire time. I wasn't entirely certain how the story was going to end.

Speaking of the ending--the ending also worked so well, in my opinion. While it was happy, not everything was perfect. As in real life, not every relationship was mended, and the characters did not achieve their happiness without some regret along the way.

I was already a fan of Klassen, but this is by far my favorite of her novels that I've read thus far. She is definitely one of my favorite writers in the Christian fiction world and historical fiction, in general.

There's very little about this movie that I didn't like.  First of all, Adam Sandler's voice was just plain annoying when he was doing the voice of the monkey.  I wanted to say to my television, ""Adam, you're trying too hard.  You're better than this!""  Also whoever did the voice of the giraffe was just PAINFUL to listen to.  I wanted to mute my TV everytime I saw that damn giraffe but I didn't cuz I didn't want to miss part of the story.

Also at the end when Kevin James is running around trying to find Rosario Dawson's character cuz he doesn't want her to leave the country before he can talk to her, when he's doing all this running around and trying to catch her...  Why doesn't he just call her?  I'm sure she has a cell phone and since they worked together for five years, I'm sure he has her number.

I hadn't seen ""Live at Pompeii"" in many, many years. I didn't even know that a new ""Director's Cut"" had been released, so I was quite intruiged by this.

""Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii"" (171 min.) starts off with the ""Director's Cut"" (91 min; in 16:9 widescreen). I was a little surprised to see all the additional space footage, I mean how weird is it to see International Space Station footage from (I'm guessing) the 1990s in a concert film that was filmed in late 71/early 72! I also couldn't quite understand the logic behind adding footage (not concert footage, even) from the band messing around at Abbey Studios on various ""Dark Side of the Moon"" material. All rather strange. The original film (60 min; in 4:3 full screen) is also included, thankfully. While I prefer watching the widescreen ""refit"", the original shorter movie makes a lot more sense musically and thematically. ""Echoes Part I"" and ""Echoes Part II"" bookend the fantastic Pompeii-filmed set.

Am I the only one to think that as it relates to the Pompeii-filmed footage, Nick Mason had an inordinate amount of screen time? I'm thinking as much as the other three combined. You can't as much as catch a glimpse of Roger Waters until well into ""Echoes Part I"" for some reason. The DVD contains a 15-20 min. interview with the director Adrian Maben, and it's interesting hearing him talk about the intent of making this the ""anti-Woodstock"" film, with no spectators instead of the ""million"" at Woodstock. In the end, contrary to some other reviewers here, I don't mind all that much that Maben made a ""Director's Cut"", since thankfully the DVD presents both the old and the new versions.

586,"On average, I read one book a week, so it's amazing to me that I would spend roughly four weeks reading this very magnum opus.  OK, I've been drowning in work and haven't had much time to curl up with any book, good or bad.

Speaking of good and bad, the good news is that I didn't put the book down. Faber creates a complete world of characters, time and place.  His London of the 1870s is extremely real; you can almost smell the dog turds he writes about, taste the bland food he comments on and hear the cacophony of the city.  The characters, too, are profoundly real; I never once doubted their existence.  And while I wouldn't say that the book was gripping, it did hold my interest throughout.

The bad news is that there's very little plot.  In fact, if you read the back cover (of the paperback version), you get the whole story - prostitute lures a wealthy man into keeping her.  The book doesn't end there, but that's what keeps it going for most of its 890+ pages.  And [SPOILER ALERT] it leaves the end, well, undone - you don't know what happens to the characters, or if (or how) they will survive.

241,"Upon first read of the synopsis, you would think this is a dystopian similar to Aguirre's Outpost Series. But in actuality, what we have here is a loosely written and moody dystopian without the violence.  The story is interest

The plot involves Marina - the only person to survive an attack by the Fade (parasitic creatures existing in darkness).  She will spend most of the book coming to terms with why she survived and who she is (which may or may not be a surprise to readers).

There are some dystopian tired plot devices - evil leader, misunderstood enemies, even a love triangle. But they didn't bother me considering the originality of the rest of the book.

What keeps this from being a 5 star read is the writing - there wasn't enough expository filling in segues or actions.  One minute someone is doing something then they are doing something completely different without any kind of bridge. It meant that I had to stop and go back and reread to see if I missed something.  It was bad enough that about half way through the book I just stopped trying to figure out the utterly confusing descriptions or action scenes and rushed to the ending.

More often than not, Dream Theater sounds like they simply borrow bits from all the other prog rock bands out there, and try to mesh into their own style, but it doesn't work at all, at least not on this CD/album.  I recognise the influences here.  When I'm listening to the album, I can hear Metallica, Rush, ELP, Yes, Pink Floyd, and even Ravi Shankar/Indian influences.  But, unfortunately, the influences don't really mess.  They're all over the place without becoming cohesive, and the album doesn't work at all.  The musicianship is generally very good, but it feels cold and mechanical.  The lyrics are tremendously pedestrian and borderline stupid.  The lead vocalist is desperately trying to bring emotion to the awful lyrics, and he ends up making them worse.  There is one tremendous song that I have played over and over again, and that's Beyond this Life.  Even though the lyrics and singing aren't very good, the music on that one track is fantastic.

This Train Station story was being offered at a bargain price so I thought to give Bush books another shot. Well, now I know.  Holly Bush and I aren't a good fit.  It seems that OLIVE was the only exception.

This book has good bones.  The story, unfortunately underdeveloped, could have been excellent, perhaps if written with a lighter touch and a tad more care and talent.  Instead almost everyone here was an exaggerated caricature and the story was predictable and exasperating.  For example, how unkind and mean-spirited can one family be?  Based on the Crawford family here, the answer is limitless unkindness and meanness.  And how stupid and spineless can one heroine be?  Based on Julia here, the answer is limitless spinelessness and stupidity.

The hero was 90% OK except for his one big moment of failure.  The mistaken identity and subsequent wrong couples paired at the beginning was not used to any advantage, the city girl acclimating to country life was underdeveloped, and, frankly speaking, I didn't like anyone in the Crawford family, including the heroine.  The hero deserved someone with more sense and more spine.

Ironically, I really struggle reviewing books that touch me deeply. I just don't have the words. I am not a writer. My job is to read and then leave a few words here and there relating what I thought about the book before moving on to the next one in the pile. Unloved cannot, under any circumstances, be broken down into simple words and sentences. It is a book that you must read to appreciate the depth of the characters, the brokenness inherent within Cassidy and the futileness of a relationship between him and Brynn.

Never have I felt more deeply for a hero than I did Cassidy. From the beginning my heart broke for him. Over and over again. Even when love was right there where he could touch it, taste it, embrace it, he was never free to do so.

This story didn't even come close to where I thought wed eventually end up. Why did I expect the predictable from this author when I know she doesnt do predictable? I refuse to go into any of the storyline because, amazing as it is, this book is so much more. This is a true showcase of Ms. Regnerys abilities to form, create and share her characters with her readers. As a fan of her Fairytale set, I only thought I had experienced her best work. With Unloved I realized she had only been whetting our appetites.

If you are going to read only one book this year it must be Unloved.

5386,"In my review of Bad Neighbor (Book 1 in this series), I said that I thought that Abby sounded like a nightmare.  And for much of this book, I really didn't like her as a character.  She seemed to me to be a bit of an arrogant, spoilt brat.  By the end of the story, I will concede that she had grown on me somewhat.

I should also say that I was surprised by how very different the tone was in this book.  I expected more of the same, given that this is part of the same series, with the same characters (albeit leads switched around).

With this book, the menace is very subtle, for the most part, even with some of the more explicit scenes.  But there is a counterpoint to this, which is a low grade, restrained pull of attraction between these two which lifts the narrative up a notch.

This was not the story I was expecting.  But it is a story which I thoroughly enjoyed.

The storyline was incredibly good. Very convincing. The lovescenes woww very hot but also very intimate and honest and full of love.
Their journey written over ten years Woww Woww and Woww. I did work so good the way it was written.
It was sometimes deep and very heartbreaking. While i am writing this review im still overwhelmed.
The characters were.... Strong, broken, deeply beautiful and soooo great

667,"I can't say exactly what drew me to this book in the first place. It's not my typical read, but the title sucked me in with promises of Houdini facing off with the great medium of his time.

I wasn't disappointed.

The writing flowed well and kept me captivated. The story is wildly interesting. I had no idea that spiritism was such a big thing in America and that such prominent names were involved with it.

More than once, I got a bit freaked out after finishing a chapter. The seances could be quite spooky to read about and I can only imagine how much spookier they were for the people experiencing them. Even though mediums were routinely exposed as false and their tricks discovered, that didn't diminish the eerie feeling that permeated throughout the book.

When it comes to complaints about the book, I have only one. It was too long.

The historical account was enough to raise the hair on the back of my neck and make my arms break out in goosebumps. But it took so long to get anywhere with the story that I got frustrated. There are a lot of in-depth backstory about people that don't have much, if any, relevance to the story.

Length aside, The Witch of Lime Street is fabulous. It's a well-researched and fascinating account of a time in our history when science and spiritism nearly joined hands.

3192,"This is my third book by this author, the others being ""Hell Bent"" & ""The Chosen"".  I think she writes a good story but somehow so far hasn't totally satisfied me but I'm still persevering.  I admit to buying her books due to the low price but also based on the reviews.  ""The Heat"" had very, very many 5 star reviews and a few very bad reviews. I ended up somewhere in the middle.

I liked the strong characters, the alpha werewolves being their stereotypical arrogant, brutal selves like most of the genre. There were a few new twists and turns to their mythology which was well done.  As in the other HKW books I've read, the action scenes are very suspensefully written and the sex steamy.

Along with other reviewers, I wonder why there are so many typos, misplaced words and grammatical problems with Kindle books generally?  Why can't they be edited properly?  Is this the author's fault?  The errors can distract you from the story quite easily.

While there are other paranormal romances I've enjoyed more than this one, I will go on to read the rest of the series.  It's not as bad as some of the reviewers say and there is certainly something that still attracts me to this author.

8575,"I have to say that I liked this book a bit better than the first.  Wasn't so rushed to sex when they first met.  I had a big problem with Molly's character.  She was kinda rude and very inconsiderate.  Just to show up like that after one or 2 emails?  Not even a phone conversation?  Of course I felt bad for Kellan because he was shocked by her behavior and the way she acted.  She was very demanding and he honestly didn't know whether to scratch his watch or wind his butt.  What did she expect when she showed up unannounced?  She seems pretty desperate for a 19 year old.  Her character just didn't mesh well with this story.  She's self-centered and has the gall to call HIM a jerk....not sure if she actually said jerk but its implied.  Give the man some breathing room!  Kellan is supposed to be this alpha werewolf...yeah he's a lone wolf but he seemed more like a beta or something.  Never acted alpha like at all kinda wimpy!  Owen kicked some ass though.  Kellan at times seemed about as immature as Molly sometimes.  Their ""relationship"" seemed too rushed.  We got details about everything else going on around them but nothing much in the way of Kellan and Molly.  I know its a short story but you have to be more thorough than that.  Characters need to make sense and be somewhat likable.

2835,"Too Bad To Die is described as a WWII thriller in which British Naval Intelligence officer Ian Fleming races to foil a Nazi plot to assassinate Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin at the Tehran Conference. Since I am a big fan of historical thrillers and especially those set during WWII, I was certain Too Bad To Die was going to be a big hit with me.

To its credit, I enjoyed the rich historical detail Francine Mathews packs into her latest book, and I learned a lot about many of those people who were world leaders and influencers of those leaders during WWII.

Unfortunately, however, I felt that Mathews spent so much of her book packing historical details into it that they overshadowed her ability to tell a tense and enthralling thriller. For me, Too Bad To Die moved at such a slow pace that by the time any real thrills and actions occurred they were too little, too late. Further, while the tidbits about many of the 'real people' characters were interesting and, at times, juicy, Mathews' ability to present richly developed characters -- including her main character, Ian Fleming -- was just mediocre. As a result of these flaws, on several occasions I came very close to giving up on this book.

I then noticed that the sink had a very small hole in the back inside which did not go entirely through the sink. It was likely just a bubble in the granite mix that came to the surface and remained unseen until it got to me. The hole was about a quarter of an inch in size. I didn't want to take out the sink and replace it for two reasons: one it is a lot of work and two it seems like such a waste of materials in the environmental sense.
I called the company and they would replace the sink free of charge (not install). I asked them if I fixed the hole in some way if it would void the lifetime warranty. They said ""try it"" if it doesn't work we will still cover it. That is where the J-B Weld comes in. The black color of the epoxy is almost a perfect match for the black sink. Since I've used the J-B before I know it is strong. I carefully filled the hole. Later I asked my wife if she could find the repair and it took her some time to find it. It has been about a year since the repair and it is still perfect.

7499,"After looking at the selection of RFID wallets, I decided on this make and model. I have been unable to find anything wrong with this wallet as outlined in some of the negative reviews. I chose the brown color. The wallet is  made from very thin material and , yes, there is a crinkling sound when the wallet is opened and closed or the bill separator flap is moved. I don't see this to be an issue and just people nit-picking. I've only had the wallet a day or so and it is holding my stuff firmly in place and I don't see anything that would indicate the wallet is fraying or coming apart..., yet.
Now, this wallet is definitely overpriced by about $10-$12 dollars in my estimation. It does feel cheap and I guess the RFID blocking works. I have no easy way to check. I did receive an email asking me to give the wallet a 5 star review for reasons I find unworthy and objectionable.
This is not a 5 star wallet if all factors are considered. I 've had expensive wallets from Italy and this is not in the same class. My review is taking into consideration the price, workmanship and what it is supposed to accomplish with RFID blocking.
In conclusion, the material is thin and the wallet feels cheap and the price is high. On the other hand, I think t was the best pick from the Amazon RFID wallets. I don't expect this wallet to last more than one year at the high end.
If I could get an Italian RFID wallet, I would not resort to such an inferior looking wallet but right now the RFID made my sale.",2,"[1.320734180274555, 1.0983715115248112, -0.5943039530758212, -1.0212205749644334, -1.7010557971033897]",1.320734180274555

3183,"*I received a free copy of this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.*

When I first starting reading Beyond Limits, I wasn't sure if I would like it. My main concern was that I felt like I was missing something, like I should have read all the preceding books in the series. My other concern was that I didn't expect so much of it to be related to the military, which worried me because of how a lot of books often portray military men as demanding jerks.

I have to say that those concerns evaporated very quickly. By the second or third chapter, I could see that I didn't have anything to worry about. My concern about having missed something was short-lived, because everything I needed to understand the current story was right there on the pages.

My other concern was also short-lived, because I learned that isn't how Laura Griffin writes her military characters. I was relieved and impressed by how she handled it. The men have the good qualities like protectiveness, physicality, and bravery, but none of the expected bad characteristics like egocentrism or excessive arrogance.

One thing that stands out in my mind about Beyond Limits is how incredibly real everything felt. I have no military or law enforcement knowledge, so I cant attest to the accuracy. However, it seemed very well researched.

If you like a book with exciting action, hot sex, a satisfying romance, and solid investigative work to track down terrorists, you should give Beyond Limits a try. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.

There was this fantastic build happening as this exciting world and all these interesting characters were introduced. Loved all the suspense! I loved Mia and Nico so much. But Mia, she was fantastic! So strong in this world where she had to fight so hard and endure so much. I just loved the strength she had and how she persevered through such a hard life. And Nico. Hello Mr. Mob Boss! He was so powerful and commanding, sexy and hot. Their chemistry together was so fantastic. It was like an electric connection. I loved their animosity and that push and pull they had with one another. I thought there was great character development and I loved watching all there drama unfold and them come together. There was conflict, ups and downs, and so much heat. It was all awesome!

This was such a fantastic introduction to the Ruin & Revenge series series. There are a lot of different characters to in play, different dynamics and things happening. It was so exciting to read and I can't wait to see what will come in future stories. So much ground work was laid and I'm hooked! I love that it was told from three different perspectives. It added such a great and intriguing layer to everything that was happening. I thought it was a really fresh element that had me rooting for everyone's HEAs.

This world was raw, gritty, and violent and in the midst of it all, there were also these wonderful moments of levity woven in that I found perfect and very needed in the midst of all the drama. I thought there was a great balance between it all. I was just so into everything!

I wasn't sure what to expect when I cracked this open but I am thrilled with the fantastic story I was able to lose myself in. If you need some sexy suspense with really hot mob guys thrown in and a tough as nails heroine, definitely give this a shot. I highly recommend it. It's a crazy world and an intense ride but so worth it!

And if ever a movie deserved a Special Edition DVD, it's this one.  I've watched the movie plus the 13 minutes of deleted scenes and the documentary on the making of the film and I'm still hungry for more.  It deserves every second of attention.
(I'd liked to have seen more discussion of the novel but, as has been known for decades, author Ken Kesey never saw the movie and distanced himself from it.  He said it would have been like ""watching his child murdered"" or something.  Go figure.  How many novelists would have given their writing arm to see an adaption as good this one?)
One thing that struck me watching the movie after all these years is how director Milos Foreman never misses an expression in every scene.  From the documentary, we find out that he filmed without letting the actors know who was being filmed, so the acting and timing and editing become a marvel to watch.

8390,"I'm truly sad that I didn't enjoy this book as much as everyone else. It was just an OK read for me. Mostly it was the first half -- I had a hell of a time getting into the story, and almost put it away. I felt like the writing didn't flow as smoothly or something...either that or I was just in a mood.

I'm also big on characters, and I was only so-so on Courtney and Clay. Not sure if I just didn't get a good read on them, but it took me a bit to warm up to them. They had their funny moments, but I guess I was just missing some depth....which is funny, b/c I think I'm in the minority for this opinion.

I also had a hard time wrapping my head around the speed with which their relationship moved... I mean, they talked about it themselves and how sometimes you just 'know', but I guess I just had a hard time suspending my disbelief that you could move on after less than a week. But that could be just a personal thing....

Lastly (on the con side -- which this review is feeling super negative and I really hate that), I was missing some sort of conflict...or climax...or something. It just felt very sweet and everyday. Which is not a bad thing, but I guess it's not what I was looking for, you know? Maybe I just wanted more from the conflicts we were presented with (Mike, Nicole, Grant, Maggie).

On the plus side, the sexual chemistry between Clay and Courtney was off the charts. And I really enjoyed the secondary characters (from Clay's parents to Courtney's Mom, to Maggie, Luke, Jenna and Brad).

It was humorous where it needed to be and who better to be humorous than Ryan Reynolds, totally love this guy, always and ever but that is not why this got 4 stars from me.

They try way too hard, let's have a bit of a story and let's highlight some of the background characters. Parallax was way too big and it reminded me of Galactus in the Fantastic Four movie.

163,"How to review an extremely random novel and yet be cohesive?  Well, first of all I wish I had been able to give this one 2.5 stars because it really did not earn a full 3.  The characterization was terribly weak and the plot was a hodge-podge that was, so often, not credible.  The blurb on this book states that Kyle is a 14-year-old when his father dies and the story takes place 12 years later.  The opposite is true, however--Kyle was 12 when his father ""died"" and the story takes place fourteen years later.
Kyle's ""father"" is never developed in a credible way and the dialog attributed to him is quite lame.  In fact, most of the dialog in the novel is contrived and unbelieveable.
The plot takes twists and turns that are almost suspenseful one or two times but fall flat the remainder.  I was not familiar with this author and the ""New York Times Bestselling Author"" on the cover definitely got my attention.  After reading the book, however, I would steer clear of other Lashner books.
I would recommend passing on this one. Random + poor dialog = DON'T BOTHER! Additionally, the syntax was really inventive and, um...annoying. I am happy to finally be done with this novel.",2,"[0.5168413302579433, 1.2331019959505838, -0.48558348304517696, -1.0283205063144627, -1.9597144592667597]",1.2331019959505838

I think by now their story has been told and we are all ready to move on. With that said I am glad they did have a third book and the two getting the ending they deserve and I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Dean. He is all kinds of sex.

I think my problem with the third book is by now I realized that Dean and Liv have way too much sex. I was starting to think all there is to their relationship was their physical relationship and I never thought that until this book. I was double thinking everything about them. Maybe that was the authors intent but I do not think it was.

The book was 60% sex scenes and I was skimming through the pages. I really wanted to feel connected to the married couple but I couldnt. I just kept thinking Really, sexy AGAIN?!

Liv to me in this book was just annoying. Still with everything she seemed too independent on Dean. I was proud of her though when her mother came around and she stood up for herself but she did that before Dean came into the picture.

I do not know how I feel about this book. It was needed for an conclusion but I felt it did not do the couple justice at the end. I liked the ending okay but it was predicable; I was hoping to get more from Dean and Liv at the end. I also would have liked Deans family in this book. I really enjoyed them in book two maybe because they were so dysfunctional they made an interesting story.

They are biodegradable which is excellent.  They are light and pretty strong.  I put a 2lb weight on it and held it up with my hand.

I did not put my hand under the weight to put all the weight on my hand.

I used it to microwave a burrito over the course of several days several times a day.  The burrito would sometimes not stay closed and the interior would leak onto the plate.  The plate would stay in shape and work fine.  The interior did not warp the plate and cause it to fall apart.

I put desert on it and it worked fine.

633,"I read Everybodys Fool by Richard Russo immediately after reading Nobodys Fool.  I hate to say it, but I enjoyed Nobodys Fool much more.  But even with that being said, Everybodys Fool is still a fine book.

Russo brings us back to North Bath, New York.  This time the story is focused on Doug Raymer.  Doug was a supporting character in Nobodys Fool, but now he is front and center.  Doug is the chief of police and spends most of his time trying to find the man who is wife was about to leave him for when she fell down the steps and died.

The novel is filled with slices of life that Richard Russo does so well.  He weaves humor expertly through the whole novel.  You really start to feel like you know these people as people not just characters in a book.

The only thing that I didn't like about the novel was that Russo kept trying to get the reader up to speed on what had happened in Nobodys Fool.  It reminded me of how they talk in soap operas, where they try and keep the viewer up on the story, like Oh, theres John, he looks well even though he fell in the well after chasing the thief who robbed the bank last year and then married his daughter.

I also credit the film for what seems to have been an effort to infuse historical accuracy in the characters and atmosphere of those times.  But, I don't understand why the movie was split between 2 disks, why it was as long as it was, or why anyone still thinks that DiCaprio can act?
Daniel Day Lewis performance was excellent.  Scorsese would have done well with more subtlety and editing.  Apparently, he believes that viewers are too dumb to connect the dots on our own.  The blood scenes are stomach turners, and the sex orgies were gratuitous.  The scenes of prayer before the climatic violence was lifted out of the Godfather, and Cameron Diaz looked too clean and pretty for a character from that neighborhood.  I liked one reviewers attempt to analogize the plot to Hamlet, but DiCaprio lacked any of the Hamlet inner turmoil.

The cool part about this book and what sets it apart from other romance books is that it is all told in the guys point of view. I actually really enjoyed hearing the book from his point of view. I didn't agree with some of the stuff that was said by Cade. It wasn't his talking per se but what he was thinking. I found it unrealistic that he would be so sensitive to Hannah. You can tell that in his thoughts that it was a guy talking but it was what a woman would want him to think and feel. I don't believe that to be that case in real life. I also don't believe that he would have waited as long as they have to have sex (which still hasn't happened). I know this book is fiction and I shouldn't compare it to real life but if you are gonna have the perception from the guys point of view, you need to be able to actually sound like a guy and not a guy written from a female.

1623,"I really really wanted to like this book. I haven't heard anything about teenage witches since Sabrina, so I definitely wanted to give this a try for it's uniqueness. Unfortunately, I found the characters unlikable, the plot predictable, and magic uneventful. There is a little bit of witch magic in there with the elements, but mostly the magic system is based on Talent. A Talent a special ability that you are born with, not something you can learn. There are plenty books out there with characters with special powers, and the blandness of it takes away from my enjoyment of Once a Witch. The main character whines often, and is very moody. She is not very intelligent, and acts extremely childish, more so than any other YA character I can think of actually. When someone tries to explain something to her or suggest something, she doesn't listen and stomps her foot until she gets her way. Her family friend Gabriel was not much better. His humor is not funny to me, and if he is romantically interested in the main character it's not very obvious. Even with bad characters, I can still enjoy a book if the plot is interesting. This one kept my interest, barely. The bad guy was obvious from when he was first introduced, and his task takes up about 3/4ths of the novel. There is a little info about a family feud thrown in there to spur more novels, but overall Once a Witch was just too short for me. The beginning was well paced, with good detail, but the ending was too fast and the details were too sparse. Another 50 pages or so of detail and epilogue would have really helped me enjoy this more. Usually it's the drama that turns me off from YA books, but this one is full of problems, and it is the first low on drama YA novel that I really didn't like. It's not unreadable, but I'm very unimpressed.",1,"[0.8991118116108938, 1.1764771428572964, -0.9727714383939532, -1.0392264079281386, -1.1571220892624012]",1.1764771428572964

Some characters were not thoroughly developed and then it was a struggle to keep the story line straight. It took me 2/3 of the book to get into it then maybe the last 30 pages flowed. There were too many unbelievable things that happened. The end just kind of through all the loose ends together. I was really disappointed. I did my due diligence and hung in there to give this author the benefit of the doubt but I don't know if it was worth reading the whole book when my gut kept saying try something else.

Amanda Hocking is well known for selling, well ... quite a few self-published novels, but having not read any of them, I wasn't quite sure what to expect with Wake, the first book of a new trilogy.

I'm touch and go on stories with mermaids/selkies/sirens. They are so awkward to write about, to try to figure out logistics and such. I mean - it's not like you can actually be sexy with a fin for your lower half, right? So while I think Hocking did an admirable job trying to make this strange, mystifying race alluring, I think it all kind of got lost in a strange loops.

Because, honestly, I finished the book yesterday and here's what I remember about it: girl swims, girl falls for guy, sister falls for guy, girl swims, something bad, the end.

Was I entertained while reading Wake? Sure. I mean, I wanted to finish the book, it wasn't difficult to read, but it was a sort of morbid curiosity that ultimately led to me finishing it.

These are the elements that John le Carre has worked and reworked in admirable prose and which are all in evidence in this book. lf Mr. le Carre were some other writer, I might conclude he was growing old and tired.

Part of the author's appeal is his disinclination to rely on the graphic violence that has become a staple in current suspense novels.

This was a big mistake. I should have read the reviews here first since it seems most were not big fans of this novel. It was boring, repetitive and seemed to drag on forever.

It seemed to take forever to get to the point of the book and when it did, I was either completely bored and ready to quit, or the ending was really that anticlimactic.

352,"I had uncommonly high expectations prior to reading this account of the Great War. I consider myself a devoted reader to authors such as Hazel Gaynor and Lauren Willig and so I knew the storyline was something that I wanted to analysis. Truthfully the novel didn't necessary meet the presumptions that I had regarding the material.

At the introduction of the novel I found myself lost. The story is not at all written, with the subject matter and concerning a large amount of absent detail. Such details that are mentioned are those that involve a destructive violence that I would prefer not to be included in any book. So almost instantly I was turned off by the novel, but I continued anyhow only to come to the sad conclusion that none of the stories thrilled me.

Each of the stories seem to ramble about with leading characters that really do not have to survive after the Great War. I both hated and admired the traits among the characters as putting one's life back together following a war is never easy. The determination to continue moving forward with their individual lives is something I favored with each story. Still, from a reader's point of view none of the stories were well-written due to the lack in detail.

2030,"Unspoken by Dee Henderson was one of the slowest moving books I've ever read. It was so mundane. Over 440 pages-many of which I skipped because they weren't necessary to the story-of things like, ""Do you want cookies?""
""Yes, and some milk.""
Seriously mundane stuff.
I've read Dee in the past but hadn't picked up any of her work in years, this is probably why. When I lose interest in an author I should probably just stay away.
I wanted to love this story, but so much of it was the two main characters talking about her millions of dollars to give away, or the coins that she had to sell.

There was some romance and mystery thrown in there, though it was easy to figure out the connections. The ""who done it"" wasn't as easy to figure out, mainly because you don't read about him until he's a suspect.

I was quite disappointed with this one and forced myself to finish it, the ending wasn't satisfying-course I did lose interest at about page 150.",1,"[-0.7715758653605574, 1.1496610384920176, -0.9998579489986362, -1.0325044757798918, -1.5423989283249884]",1.1496610384920176
9158,"I wish I'd read the fine print closer on this one.  It started out well enough and I was getting into it but it quickly digressed to less story and more sex play.  Porn really.  I like a little erotica with my romance bordering on soft porn.  But this was straight out hardcore porn.  Same sex play, sharing and menage, as well as dual couple participation disguised as instruction or teaching lessons.  I thought this was going to be about Payton McCreary (23) quitting her job at a BDSM Club and finding her strength as she builds a new life for herself. Instead, it's about her finding passion and learning to trust while overcoming her fear of relationships.  It could've been a good story if it hadn't been overpowered with contrived reasoning to insert hardcore sex.  It became boring and tedious with one sex scene after another.  On top of all this, there's no reiteration through the story of what these two characters looked like other than Dom having aqua blue eyes.  Ms. Sloane...keep them alive in our minds!  Refresh. Reiterate. Repeat the characters details. Subtle reminders go a long way in forming a solid connection.  I never had any idea what Payton looked like other than her killer body.  No visual, no connection.  Anyway, all told from Payton's POV.  It would've been nice to hear from Dominics voice.  The controversy is forced, contrived, and ridiculous.  No turmoil.  No drama.  Two stars for great wording and sentence structure, and the perfectly detailed visual of Tokyo.",1,"[-0.015620847488408529, 1.1494412847892352, -0.8999739603596646, -1.044665437186072, -1.6046623943215268]",1.1494412847892352

4180,"I don't understand the people who were freaked out by this book.  I did not find it too dark at all.  Then again several reviews had bad spoilers so I knew some of what was coming. It is a typical Pepper Winters book - unusual, dark, strangely compelling, and did I say unusual?  Her stories ARE unusual.  This one really wasn't as bad as I was led to believe.  I enjoyed the strangeness and twists (hate cliffhangers, tho, but if you have to have one, this was a lulu!!).  If you like Pepper Winters, this book will NOT surprise you with its content.  You will still like it even if it is unusual.

The hero WAS awful but I can't figure out how the other reviewers missed his slight little bit of humanity that poked out just a wee bit. THAT is what gave this book a good taste in my mouth - the hope that maybe he can redeem himself in another book.  If not, then you're gonna hate him (which is the point - he's an anti-hero - or maybe an anti-villain?).  The heroine (in my opinion only) was pretty stupid at first.  I hope she can find a brave place because I suspect the next book is only going to be darker.

I don't think it is fair for someone to give a bad review and low star count because the book is exactly what the author writes - dark with twists.  You have enough spoilers in the other reviews so why did you buy it then give it a bad review because it was what they said it was?  Give this book a chance, especially if you are used to Winters' writing style.  It is a well-written book with a strange and different story line - and I, for one, wanna know where it's going!!",4,"[-0.02521257152181744, 1.1480052547749091, -0.297983606772944, -1.0471821777355848, -1.7768905725730404]",1.1480052547749091

This is a FABULOUS CHRISTmas read and if you've followed the series it CAN NOT be missed!!!!!!!  Focusing more on sweet kids instead of the animals this time, I truly enjoyed all of these characters!  There's a touch of suspense in the mix with this one and a touch of gritty reality that has been flowing through this whole series!  This story is about change, hope, family, and love!  What a year these siblings have been through!!!!  Completing the four siblings tales, Levi picks up the plot and finds what his siblings have already found!  Continuing also with Tess I really LOVED her stories continuation!  There's a scene where she and another character are so open and honest about what they are feeling!  I LOVED it!  It is so refreshing among the suspense and turmoil of hidden secrets and feelings from other characters!  With the characters coming together in REALLY GREAT scenes and their pasts colliding with their present, this is a highly entertaining read and became one of my favorites of the series!

5166,"I really enjoyed the last JD Hollyfield book I read, so I jumped at the chance to read My So Called Life. The book teasers and synopsis make the book sound like a hilarious romantic comedy, however, I didn't find it funny or engaging. I blame that mostly on the characters.

Penelope Summers, known to her friends as Penny, is not the sort of heroine that compels me to care about her story. She is whiny. She complains a lot. She drinks tequila like it is water, and it's not clear that her alcohol-infused decision making is sound. She blatantly states that she is never on time, and yet she is considers her boss a troll for noticing that she is all too frequently late for work. She is concurrently portrayed as an intelligent professional with significant job responsibilities, however, every action and word out of her mouth screams immature, entitled, and dissatisfied. As a character, she was not only unlikable but unreal or poorly defined. Her endless angry ranting quickly became tiresome.

The story follows Penny from the office to being dumped by her aspiring-politician boyfriend to a cruise to a new beau. This Cinderella-like story has its own prince charming who is delightful, engaging, and a much more interesting narrator. Time again, I wondered what attracted Sam to Penny, but in the end, he makes it work and the two get their HEA.

I already guessed what was going on by the time it was revealed, though it doesn't deflect from the story, there were still some twists I didn't see coming and I can't mention what I did see coming or I'd ruin it for everyone else.

Also, the British language for the cops was over-done a bit and everyone seemed to be shouting at everyone which was extremely annoying. The writing style was great and the character personalities were well outlined but I can't get past the over dramatic British lingo and the fact they shouted (exclamation marks everywhere) all over the place.

I did like the story and the storyline though, that's what kept me hooked to the end.

791,"Blame is a novel that takes us through two decades of the life of Patsy MacLemoore.  In 1981, Patsy is convicted of killing two people while driving a vehicle under the influence of alcohol.  She was in a blackout during the incident and has no memory of the event.  She is sentenced to four years in prison for the crime.  The book deals very realistically with the concept of alcoholism as a disease.  ""After a certain point, our disease takes us only to hospitals, jails or morgues."" (p. 27).  During her time in prison, Patsy becomes involved in Alcoholics Anonymous and is a firm convert to 12-step programs.

The book has a secondary plot which I found interesting and poignant.  A lot of the novel takes place in the early 1980's.  Several of the key characters are gay men and they are integrated into the plot very naturally as Patsy's friends. The onset of AIDS begins in the early 1980's and the novel deals with the losses and grief associated with this disease.

Approximately two decades after Patsy's incarceration, she is given information that turns her life into a tailspin.  She has to deal with the typical alcoholic's issues of shame, secrecy and silence in order to integrate this news.  To say more about what she is told would be to give too much away.

The book deals quite a bit with Patsy's love life and her inability to choose healthy lovers and companions for herself.  She works with a therapist to try to understand why she keeps repeating old patterns that don't work for her.

I liked this book but I felt that there were too many issues not dealt with sufficiently at the end, especially in relationship to Patsy's marriage and her own sense of self-esteem.  I think the book does an excellent job on educating the reader about alcoholism while also telling an interesting narrative.  All in all, I'd give this a 3.5 if I could.",3,"[1.129774190180567, -0.08622416699894975, -1.2222809480939887, -1.0326046606327899, -1.367137617712353]",1.129774190180567

The main character played by Tom Cruise is a selfish magazine owner born with a silver spoon in his mouth. That's OK, even though he's not a very likeable character, he does have enough redeeming qualities to make you care what happens to him. Penelope Cruz is a sweet, enthusiastic character who doesn't fall for his tricks, but falls in love with him and he falls for her. A stellar performance by Cameron Diaz as a woman used by the main character for sex, takes the ultimate revenge and scars him for life. What ensues after that is a twisted maze of continuously changing storylines, leaving the viewer completely confused at what's going on. Worst of all, you don't even care. I agree with the other reviewer who said this movie is disjointed. It's so disjointed that half-way through the movie I almost shut it off. Still, I stuck it out. My persistence wasn't rewarded as the story became more and more convoluted. At the end you are left with an even more disjointed ending that leaves you saying to yourself, ""what the hell was that all about!""

The set up for the ROKU was relatively easy, once I placed the ROKU directly in line with the router. However, I did have to go through the set up more than once. Issues that were problems involved synching the remote to the ROKU along with the ROKU having difficulty connecting to my network. Once these items were resolved, I thought it would be clear sailing, until I tried to download my first movie.

That's when I spent what felt like an eternity waiting for the movie to download, and when it began, it was constantly interrupted with the loading message.

Since my Internet connection tests well above the required speed, and since my laptop, using the same router signal does not experience the same problems, I can only assume that the problem exists between the router and the ROKU, especially with the original set up issues.

To test my theory, I connected the ROKU using the ethernet cable, and immediately everything sped up 100%.

Now that it is hard wired, all is well, including speed. As a result, I am particularly grateful for this version which permits the Ethernet connection.

I am all for having to suspend disbelief when watching one of these movies, but things like the killer being able to movie bodies around in a short period of time, and leave no trace of blood is just stupid.  Unlike the plot twist revealing the killer in the first movie, this one was easy to spot a mile away.  Plus we are subjected to Jack Black as a dreadlocked stoner.

The two things that this one had going for it is that the dialog was not as schlocky and stupid as it was in the first one.  And, despite the tease at the end of the movie, they thought better of making any more of these.  Like the predecessor I do not think this is a must see or must own.

There does not seem to be a ""main"" plot; the focus of the story is giving backstory to the other Nina Reilly books.  It's like one long chapter in a book-to-come. It did make for a pleasant evening's reading, though.

I agree with the reviewer who could not recognize Nina.  Usually I find her a little too cold and hard for my taste; here she exhibits superhuman stamina, but way too much emotion.  It's a little harsh to say she acts like she's in heat, but she does seem surprisingly interested in sex for someone as exhausted as she must be.

More importantly, I cannot believe that a woman as intelligent as Nina could ""accidentally"" become pregnant in the 1990s.  Affordable, efficient birth control has been easy to come by for DECADES; I do not think the accidental pregnancy plot is acceptable any more without a pretty strong story explaining how it could happen -- like maybe a poor teenager from a fiercely religious background and a weak self-image.

I can't quite put my finger on one specific reason, it just seems to have been a lot of little ones. The sex between them was the same, and the sub-plots were there, but I just couldn't get emotionally involved with any of it.

The prior stories were filled with gut wrenching drama that sucked you in and left you wanting more.  This one just seemed to tie up everything a little too neatly, maybe it was due to so many sub-plots going on that left the author stretched too thin to touch us as she did in the first three books.

I see that there is another book coming out in 2015, ""The Baby"", if I was basing my desire to read it on this story alone, I wouldn't be excited at all.  I hope it proves me wrong.

And Kirra, who had already become a favorite character of mine from the last book, is an amazing character that overcomes hardship and heartache and who learns to heal!  All of my favorite characters come back as the McKennas band together to solve their final mystery!  Using the Iditarod for a backdrop Dani's writing is so expressive there were times I had to stop reading before I got frostbite! LOL!  I LOVE the messages of Faith and love, I enjoyed the suspense and mystery, and as always I adore the characters!  Fast paced and filled with great scenes, it makes me wish this wasn't the end!  I wouldn't mind if Dani comes out with another book with all of these characters centering more around any kids they might have...hint hint Dani! ;) LOL!  Overall this is a fabulous series filled with action and adventure that shouldn't be missed!

While the premise of a teacher who hates her students is definitely serviceable, I was annoyed by two things:

1.  In the movie, the teacher's supposedly brutal sense of humor was too soft.  She really should have been much crueler.  I think this is because the film was going for the wrong sense of humor.  It was going for the shock-joke nature of comedy, while it should have been aiming at a sardonic, ironic kind of humor.  I kept waiting for her to unload some nasty, soul-crushing comments on the students or other faculty, but instead she was just a paper tiger.

2.  While her character was well-sketched, she underwent a complete, unprovoked reversal at the very end that betrayed everything that had gone before.  Quite apart from the fact that that ending could be seen coming from a mile way, the movie hadn't ""earned"" it.  It felt abrupt, felt like they had just done it because her renouncing her big goal abruptly at the end of the movie and starting to love teaching was what was expected by the audience.  But the movie would have been tons more effective and memorable if she stuck it out through the end, got her plastic surgery, and then given everyone the finger at the end of the movie.  It would have been much truer to her character and the nature of the film in general.

One minute she could never trust anyone again, and then the next she was in tears because she'd lost her chance with him forever. Ugh. Craziness, even for pregnancy hormones. She was inconsistent in other ways too--at the beginning of the story, when she's planning on seducing him as part of her great ""get the cheating ex out of her head"" plan, she knew that Garrett had a thing for her in high school. She was counting on it. But later on when Garrett mentions the same to her brother/his best friend Mike, she acts amazed. Why? It made no sense. Garrett was a more steady character on the whole, but even he did the lightning-fast emotion change thing a time or two.

About halfway through the book - maybe a bit further, the story went from an interesting fiction novel to more of a paranormal/science-fiction type story.  Now, normally I love these stories, but I dislike having it sprung on me after I'd already become fairly entrenched in the historic aspect of the novel.  But, this is personal preference.

I've mentioned the ""bad guy"" aspect.  Honestly, I think the book could have done without the villain.  There were enough bad guys.

The writing is musical and easy to read.  However, I grew annoyed with the attempts made by the author to input the accent of the upper east into the conversations being held.  It was great to read the old way of speaking in the historic story, not so great to read the ""r's"" constantly replaced by ""ah's"" in the newer story.

Overall, it was a fun read and not quite what I expected.  I did get reasonably spooked out and it gave me some pretty funny dreams last night.

Pretty sure everyone knew, but them.....so obvious. I absolutely loved when these two came together, hotter than hell.....I mean wwwoooowwwww. Just wow.

2060,"As a confirmed Scalzi fan, I have to say that this is the second outing from this author lately which has disappointed me. The other was _Fuzzy Nation_, and both imply a certain laziness or uninterest on the part of the author for his later works.

_Redshirts_ starts out with an intriguing premise but never develops that premise beyond the most superficial treatment. Instead of a brilliantly executed completely resolved convoluted plot, such as in his _Android's Dream_, _Redshirts_ adopts a tone which can best be described as all participants shouting at each other constantly while on a rushed through poorly explained resolution.

Even the resolution isn't fully expressed within the body of the plot. Instead Scalzi resorts to the lame gimmick of 'codas' which aren't really different endings  or variations, but rather tacked on plot resolutions two of which are reasonably interesting (if uninvolving) to read but one of which is more shouting cranked up to 140 dB. Yes, these elements add to the story but they also could have been worked into the main plot bringing a good deal of added texture to this shallow novel, but that would have taken some effort. Instead, (refer back to laziness) they are just thrown on at the end to lengthen the book by about a third and it's left to the reader to shoehorn them into the main narrative.

I have enjoyed previous Scalzi works so much I will surely give him another try if he chooses to produce another novel, but I doubt I'll pre-order as I did this one. I held off reviewing this work because I feel rather sad having to give two three star reviews in a row from an author I have always held to be a solid five star, but that's the way I see it.",2,"[-1.0078290973692805, 1.0372773075322095, -0.24927980810958217, -0.9939764809349595, -2.7144548844366203]",1.0372773075322095

9930,"I know that my house is wired for a doorbell. Or I suspect it is. But do I want to mess with that? And the possible zaps I might get in trying to get it working again? And hey, that doorbell has only one volume option, and I can't turn it off. No, I want something much easier and more flexible.

So I affixed the transmitter to the outside of the house, put one receiver in the main living area, and the other one in the basement. The basement one is turned up LOUD (to transmit over laundry, furnace sounds, etc.), but the main floor one is set at quite a low volume, because I'm typically sitting right there.

Just save yourself the time of trying to click through all the awful chime sounds. The default one, the first one in the list -- that's the one you want. Ding dong, ding dong. Beats the heck out of getting songs stuck in your head all day.

Yes, you might have to replace the transmitter battery. But worst case scenario is that the doorbell stops working, and people have to knock on the door.",4,"[1.0162608500020778, 0.149747134984492, -1.2449074271314566, -1.017270388003679, -1.269244266800339]",1.0162608500020778

The Prologue hooked me right away. Then after that the story was fine. Just I kept reading. It was not until I was about twenty two chapters in that I was wondering when the story was going to start. What I mean by this is that Brenda was the only person of any real interest. Everyone else including Birdy and Kendall bored me and unimpressed me. Plus all of the other secondary characters got on my nerves. After a while longer of reading this book, I jumped to the ending, which was so, so.

This one touches me on a soul piercing level. This couple's journey is complex and deep. This is the story about two people that love each other but have lost their way as a couple. Everyday life, half truths, secrets, lies, lack of communication, fear of rejection effect their day to day life, intimacy and love for each other. They are soul mates but life is making it so hard to believe in that, it rips at their fondation of love.  It is the promise of steadfast love that holds your heart in a strangled hold of anticipation, hope and fear for them. Can they overcome all these obstacles, doubts? Will they trust each other enough to move forward and hold each other's hearts close? To treasure the love ? I can not wait to see where the conclusion of the story leads.

The information contained in ""The 4-Day Diet"" is nothing new.  Anyone who has gone through a weight loss program from Weight Watchers to Jenny Craig to Susan Powter have all heard about the mental preparation of losing weight so Smith's approach isn't new.

What Smith is good at it is taking the process of weight loss and breaking it down into workable bites (no pun intended) or modules.

I liked the idea of modules, although when I actually tried the diet, I was so hungry by the 5th day and no amount smooth-talking Ian Smith coaching could take away the hunger.

That said, I found that while I might not use Smith's exact model, I can modify and tweak it so it fits for me.

I was never able to find the extra recipes on the final disk but that may be a restriction of my copy or I am looking in the wrong place.

I have to admit that I did find listening to Smith a bit tiresome after awhile and perhaps I would have been better suited at reading the book rather than getting the Audio CD, but that's just me.

1) The book was more literary criticism than memoir, and I frequently had to rummage through my shelves to re-acquaint my poor memory with the novel she was currently discussing. I can't say I agreed with all of her literary analyses, but it was very thought-provoking.

2) The descriptions of everyday life in Tehran were deeply moving - it is truly horrifying what they were forced to endure. I had nightmares (more than once) about being picked up by faceless black ghouls and thrown into prison for wearing pink socks or some other ridiculous offense.

3) The author skips backwards and forwards in time throughout the book in a very disorienting manner. It was impossible for me to keep the names of her students straight. She seemed to have a more intense emotional relationship with ""her magician"" than with her husband.

4) Because of its place on bestseller lists, I assumed it was a buy-it-in-the-airport-and-read-it-on-the-plane book. Not even close. It took me about ten times longer to read this than a fiction book of comparable size.

1882,"REVIEW OF: THROUGH THE EYES OF A LION: FACING IMPOSSIBLE PAIN, FINDING INCREDIBLE POWER

I'd like to thank Amazon for the opportunity to review this  miraculous book that I received as a complimentary sample.

Pastor Levi Lusko has written a truly remarkable book that is very simple and beautiful in its honesty. He and his wife experienced the horrific pain of the sudden unexpected death of their beloved daughter.

We readers can be very grateful to Pastor Levi for giving us the strength and courage to go beyond our grief, no matter  the personal circumstances that brought us to this place.

In his healing, soothing words,  Pastor Levi teaches us a helpful way to allow our grief to strengthen our ability to face the many challenges of life. The book is written plainly and kindly.  The reader will no doubt appreciate the organization of this book into discrete chapters that focus on a specific theme (e.g. ""Pain is a Microphone"", ""Run Towards the Roar"").  Throughout the book,
one finds hope and inspiration and helpful ideas that enable us to find solutions to our problems.

As unique as we all are, we do share many things in common.  Most people do have it within themselves to meet challenges as they come. But clearly, sometimes it can be overwhelming and we might not see so clearly.  Pastor Levi becomes both teacher and guide and empowers us as we learn from his experiences.

Through The Eyes Of A Lion may be helpful reading for someone you know well who is confronting obstacles in their life. Certainly, it is inspirational and helpful on many levels.

This is a remarkable book. The lessons and insights contained within stay with you. You may reach for this book time and again.",4,"[-2.3742762511093014, -2.1553572455736436, -2.2122183450753266, -1.0522795680377768, 1.0010803126073113]",1.0010803126073113

When the story focuses on Anita and her ""projects"", then it is great, but when the whole book is about sex then it is boring. I am almost through with this one and I am bored to death with it. She has gone into yet another vampire club to save one of the wereleopards and been bitten by him. She may become a wereleopard (I'll find out if I can make myself finish the book.) In the meantime she has let Jean Claude ""marry"" the marks (this was done on stage at the vampire club and had everyone all hot and bothered...except for the reader who was appalled). After the marks ""marry"", she starts having sex with everyone in sight and it's one sex scene after another. While she is doing all this, the wereleopard is still waiting to be rescued. 2 books back the storyline was pretty much like this, but the last book was good, but that is because Anita was in New Mexico helping out Edward. Hopefully the next book will have a plot line and more action. If you like orgies though, you will probably like this book.",1,"[0.9988729124465314, 0.9622275497417544, -0.6543634170926711, -1.0304953950911844, -1.773370627767021]",0.9988729124465314

I almost gave up on it in the beginning, the premise of one auctioning off their virginity was weird enough but it starts off pretty slow and I put it down. It was hard to get into but I am really glad I picked it back up because the author really made a story out of it all. At that point I couldn't put it down. There are a few little twists that make it really sweet but not unpredictable. Mia decides to auction off her virginity to help pay for medical school and save her mothers home and business. She is barely surviving with her blog and orderly job. Adam is the CEO of a gaming company and wins the auction.

93,"I normally don't (ever) read apocalypse/horror stories but this book captured my attention and I decided to give it a go. I was not disappointed. No zombies or anything here, just a very unsettling feeling, a fear for the unknown that is so well-done I am surprised he really could get to me, Ms. Im grounded in reality and won't let a book get to me. The story is told in alternating chapters between Malorie ""now"" and Malorie at the beginning of the event. It all began years ago with news stories of suicides. A lot of suicides and seemingly coming out of the blue, happening to random people who were leading a happy life until that moment. Malorie, first sceptical, is forced to believe that its caused by something you see. Anyone who steps outside with their eyes open goes insane, doing violent things to themselves. We follow Malorie as she, pregnant at the time, finds refuge in a house with other sole survivors. In the present time Malorie is still living in the house with 2 young children (who have never have seen anything outside the house, just imagine that) and she is thinking about leaving the house behind and going somewhere where it might be safer. This means blindfolded, for the entire journey, with 2 small children, while something could be lurking, waiting for you to take off your blindfold. She has trained the children all through their lives to hear everything, every motion and emotion there is. But will it be enough, won't they be tempted to take off their blindfold? Whereto is not very clear either, and what happened to all the other people in the house is not hard to imagine but still, the mystery remains for quite a while. The author really creates a believable and frightening world, it felt real to me. He captures the claustrophobia of so many people in one house, how each responds so differently to whats happened, the fear and dread of the unknown, so good.",3,"[0.9964683123331037, -1.0749799916696443, -1.3149629854933471, -1.0300107012798358, -1.1465323572341612]",0.9964683123331037

1197,"It took me 1/3 of the book to finally liking it.  Perhaps it was because the author read the book herself.  Her voice is not professional therefore the book suffers from a monotone at times and whine at times.  Once I got used to her voice.  I started to like the book better.

The pros:
1. she's brave in examining her own skeleton.  I don't think she was lost or promiscuous in her 20s and 30s.  Like most young women, she's search for identity and finding her own path.
2. she's good at analysis; her own mind and the minds of her 5 women.
3. she's intelligent, which is obvious in her word choices.  Although the big words she's fond of using can feel too pompous at times.
4. I find it refreshing to mix autobiography with biographies of others.  She jumps from her own life and feeling to correlate with her 5 female subjects.  It makes a rather interesting read.

The cons:
1. she can come across as lost and whiny at times; a privileged person having first world problems.  thankfully her candor saves the book from being unreadable.
2. she adores her 5 female subjects therefore I get a feeling that her assessment was rather biased at times
3. the book needs a better editor.  It can loose about 1/5 to make it tighter and more cohesive.
4. The title ""Spinster"" is misleading.  It's not really about being a spinster but being a woman in search of her own life and identity apart from the typical societal roles assigned to women.

Ms Bolick is an introspective and intelligent woman.  I don't think we should be too harsh to judge this book.  With time and aging, I am sure she will blossom into a better writer.  I do hope that she would write a followup to Spinster when she's 65 or 70.",3,"[0.7146944935255519, 0.9950452450787785, -0.9471975944420543, -1.01364828120455, -1.6562039983792978]",0.9950452450787785

It plods along about her awful parents and her splintered upbringing and the constant moving from place to place. She marries Winston and is pregnant constantly with children she doesnt seem to care for. His political career is where she shines as his conscience and advisor.

802,"First of all, how can you read this title and not want to read this book? I fell in love with the title so much that the book almost didn't matter. Okay, not really, but still...you have to admit, it is pretty great.

So begins my review:

Sheesh! Don't read this book if you have anything else you want to accomplish that day. This is one of those laugh out loud, carry-the-book-everywhere-with-you-even-into-the-bathroom kind of books. If I hadn't been reading the digital edition it might have even had a bath with me. Couldn't put it down!

Once I started reading this book it captured my attention completely. The writing is modern and a times a bit risque (there are a few F-bombs but they are rather funny.) I fell in love with the main character on the first page. I did, really. She is about to get married when all Hell breaks loose and she must make a decision that will forever haunt her. It must have been tough and I think I could identify with her indecision, even if I hadn't lived through quite the same situation.

This novel is just an overall joy to read. The romance is paced perfectly. You never know exactly what to expect and the tension is just right. There is a feeling of comfort in these pages, like you have settled into your favorite pair of jeans and cuddled up in your most comfortable chair.

I loved that the main characters had such a long and developed history between them. This made the story feel somehow more logical and gave me another reason to care about what happened between them. The variety of choices the main character had on who she would choose and where she would end up kept the plot interesting and unexpected.

I didn't really see the ending coming, and I liked that I had to guess even at the last couple of chapters. Well played author.

If you are looking for a perfect book for a lazy Saturday afternoon and want to laugh, smile and just have a lot of fun, this book would be a great choice. I have found another author that I must add to my list of favourites.

2455,"I love books that surprise me and in The Palace Job, the surprises just never stopped coming. The story twists and turns and things rarely turn out the way you were expecting them to. I like the author's writing style, as well. The book flows quickly along, with lots of action, sharp dialog, and a clever sense of humor.

One thing that might not work for everyone is an overall lack of detailed explanation. Often, things happen or characters appear that aren't explained and, as the story whips along, you've either got to figure it out on your own or just accept it and go along. I have complained about this in other books, but with The Palace Job, it didn't bother me. I thought it was consistent with overall style of the book, which was is lean and spare, pared down to the essentials.

However, one thing I did miss, and the reason for the 4 star rating rather than 5, was really getting to know the characters. For the most part, the characters were still Women and Men of Mystery at the end of the book.

Although I think this movie fell a bit short with its story that is a bit lacking, I like Wilson and Harrelson's performances.  Unfortunately, the movies plot that fell into the same type of storyline that is often repeated in many animated films.  There are some moments of laughter but this movie is probably more enjoyable for the smaller audience than it was for us adults.

2064,"This was a fairly good novel but I found the author's style to be a bit trying.  Chapters alternated between Claire and The Hermit.  Nothing wrong with that.  However, within a chapter the author jumped all over the place.  A paragraph about the Hermit jumps to a paragraph about Ted Kennedy, followed by a paragraph about what the Hermit thinks, followed by a paragraph about Chappaquiddick, and then a paragraph about the Hermit.  This style appears in many of the chapters and, quite frankly, it detracts from the story. Another detraction was the detailed culinary play-by-play.  It was a novel and not a cookbook so the over-the-top descriptions were irritating since each meal was wrought with details that were so unnecessary.
The character development was quite good and that is a postive element.

**Copy received in exchange for an honest review**

Where to begin? Have you ever read a book that is impossible to put into words? A book that came into your life at exactly the right time? A book that changed how you look at life? I book that you are convinced will be a New York Times best seller? Well, THIS is that book, for me? Giving it 5 stars just isn't enough! I must warn you that you WILL cry. I have actually heard people say that this is the first book that made them cry. You will cry tears of laughter, joy, and sorrow. You WILL cry!

This is a NA book, but is SO MUCH MORE! It is a romance, a book about coming of age, a book about overcoming life's obstacles, about mending relationships between a mother and daughter and a father and son, and a book with so many lessons to be learned. The most important lesson is probably to not judge a book by it's cover. Rivers and Delilah learn this only when faced with tragedy. For me, this book spoke to the motherly side of me. I am a recent empty-nester and have struggled with the relationship with my daughter. Without giving too much of this book away, I will say that I now, after many tears, look at our relationship with a different perspective.

There are some authors I admire for their clarity. They seem to think deeply at all times and make it seem so effortless. They are the authors I go to when I need clarity in my own life. Paulo Coelho has always been that author for me, but I just added Lindy Zart to that list!

Sometimes when I'm in the middle of a less-than-fantastic book for a review, I look longingly at that shelf and then hurry myself along (I'm also a one-at-a-time kind of girl). So, when I finished the book last week and needed something to read, it shouldn't have been hard to pick something. I surprised myself by reaching for my Nathaniel Hawthorne collection and opening up to The Scarlet Letter.

I read (or skimmed) The Scarlet Letter in high school.  B-O-R-I-N-G! After I fell in  love with The Peabody Sisters  (which I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys biographies and literature) several years ago, I was anxious to try some more Hawthorne (he was married to the youngest Peabody sister). I started The House of the Seven Gables but put it aside when I just couldn't get into it after fifty pages. Even though I really really wanted to like Hawthorne, I figured it was hopeless.

Perhaps I just wasn't ready or mature enough then. I devoured The Scarlet Letter this time. I was enthralled and fascinated with the story, themes and the beautiful language (makes reading most novels now seem like fifth grade work). I almost wish I was back in high school college so that I could discuss it with a group. I definitely have some ideas to contribute this time. And I apologize to my mom's friends--I shouldn't have laughed when I heard you were reading it for book club.

I wouldn't call it cute as some others have described, but I also didn't find it the least bit boring. I've never read a similar story and thought this had some freshness, which I appreciated.

I also liked that when the women should have been pissed, they were (except for that one time). That may sound like that means the book was predictable, it wasn't actually. I mean you know it's a romance, so you figure all will come right in the end. However, my comment is more so addressing some books I've read of late where the women are silly, doormats who take whatever is given them and lack any backbone. You won't find that here, especially not in the heroine.

It does read a bit more like a new adult romance if that classification helps. All said, I found the story very much worth my time.

9563,"This movie is one of those that for me is hard to give an ultimate rating because I can see why it didn't do well in theaters but at the same time has some things going for it that make it better than most bad movies.  This movie is one that almost feels like it is out of time, kind of like its theme with its very classic Disney feel.  In my opinion, this movie would have done better if it had been released a few decades ago with its overly optimistic and a bit preachy theme that it has as this seems to me to be a bit too much for todays movie audiences.  I am not saying that I didn't like the film though as it does have some redeeming qualities that made it ok for me to watch.  The visual and special effects are outstanding and you can see where the big budget was spent with the fantastic effects.  Cassidy as Athena also plays her role well and I think was the highlight of the actors in the movie.  The story and plotline to me was a bit scattered and lacked a bit of focus.  It was hard for me to figure out what type of audience the movie was trying to go for because at times it felt like a kids movie and at times seemed to be trying to please adults as well.  That back and forth took away from the cohesiveness of the movie and trying to please both kids and adults falls a bit flat at times.  The movies final scenes were a bit anti-climactic as well.

Is the movie as bad as some say? No I don't think so.  Nor do I think that this is a great movie.  Tomorrowland falls somewhere in between as an average one that had potential to be much more but falls a bit short of its ambitions and of its big budget. I enjoyed watching the movie; I just think it falls a bit short as a blockbuster.

9402,"""Let's Go Shopping."" This is a true story based of a group of teenagers in California who became obsessed with celebrity and fashion. After Rebecca (Chang) breaks into an empty house and takes clothes and purses she ups the ante. When she hears that Paris Hilton is out of town she talks her friend into ""shopping"" her house with her. When her friends hear about this they want in as well and soon no celebrity is safe from the thieving kids known as The Bling Ring. Going in I wasn't really looking forward to this because it didn't seem like my type of movie. Being a 34 year old man a movie about 20-somethng girls stealing famous peoples jewelry didn't sound that exciting to me. I do have to admit that this was much much better then I was expecting. I do remember hearing about this a little when it was going on which helped my enjoyment a little. The thing that really kept me from getting too involved is I didn't like the kids who were stealing but it was hard to see Paris Hilton, Audrina Patridge, Orlando Bloom, Rachel Bilson and Lindsay Lohan as victims. Overall, the movie wasn't really that bad but again I'm not the target audience.

9247,"I hadn't seen this film before watching the remake, and I gave the remake a generous 4 stars ( I say generous because it was undeserved) and after seeing this film and seeing what the remake had to work with I'm appalled the remake wasn't better.  At least the ending to this film make sense.  The acting here is decent, for a 70's film, and Hackman (who is always top notch) and Winters both did wonderfully.  The action and adventure is this film is high intensity, and while the remake did copy a few of this films best scene's the brilliance was lost in the translation.  Point being that the original, in this instance, is much better than the remake and should be enjoyed by all who haven't had the opportunity to see it yet.  The story is similar in both, both involving a cruise liner flipping over due to a rogue wave, each set in their own time periods, but what makes the films differ is the people aboard.  In this film you have a priest (Hackman) struggling to make his way right with god, and he is the one who ushers everyone to safety.  He wants to help everyone.  In the remake you have a professional gambler only concerned with his own safety.  Not that that is the main reason this film is better, for this film also gets you involved with the cast of characters, understanding all of them, knowing all of them and so you thus can be concerned about all of them.  I guess all that really needs to be said is that if you're like me and you've only seen the remake, please rent this movie and see the masterpiece that inspired the flop.",3,"[-1.5105427779607963, 0.9525513172338577, -0.4078104162668421, -1.0452529392144159, -1.674486518556939]",0.9525513172338577

579,"Reading this book was a very unique experience, and I give Mr. Martel props for his interesting style and format of the novel, if for no other reason. I enjoyed the book while reading it, was not bored by it, and yet when I was done I was not blown away as I expected to be.
First off, it is not a good idea to read this book because you loved ""Life of Pi"". It is not that text, and to expect it to be is patently unfair. Secondly, the reviews on Amazon trashing the writing of the book are absurd. Mr. Martel is clearly a proven gifted writer. To say he isn't is ridiculous.
The book is an allegory about the Holocaust, and deals with a famous writer and a very talented taxidermist. I won't go into any other plot points here, but I will say that Martel successfully interweaves elements of absurdist theatre, allegory, extended metaphor, philosophy, theology, and existentialism into an entertaining work. That is no small feat. And the book is only about 200 pages long! I am loathe to write much more about the novel as one needs to be familiar with it, to understand any honest evaluation of it.
Frankly, I think this text would best be enjoyed by a group and I heartily recommend it for book clubs. It will give you much to digest and talk about, regardless of positive or negative. I also think it is best absorbed when one can discuss its many aspects with another person. As I talked about the book with others and we compared perspectives and analysis the text became a richer experience.
One huge quibble I have with the text is that the ""big reveal"" of the book is not that big a reveal at all. You would have to be clueless not to see where the novel is going by the time you hit page 100.  The obvious impending conclusion does detract from the work a little. Still, Martel manages to make the journey thought provoking and interesting.",3,"[-0.2527613269061384, 0.9474764508969661, -0.957045425008348, -1.0566086451207914, -0.7888478641449822]",0.9474764508969661

While the plot is far from complex, its setting is an intriguing one--New Orleans in the latter part of the 20th Century with a hurricane brewing.

He write in such a way that you feel every single emotion almost all at once. This book started out a little more hopeful but eventually reality struck. Autumn and Hank both loved Summer and came together in mutual grief over her loss. Two misfits who completed each other and fell in love. Autumn has a tendency to push away the good in her life because she doesn't feel worthy of it. Will she push Hank away forever or can he overlook her insecurities? Will thier mutual love and sorrow for Summer keep them from having a future? Can these two broken souls heal or will they destroy any chance at happiness? Seth King writing is so beautiful and full of sorrow at the same time. It's highly reccomened that you read The Summer Remains before reading Autumn Rising.

this is such a pretentious phony movie, just like all bill murray played. he just got a free ticket to do, to play what he liked to do and used to do. there's nothing to do with the others, they were just walk-ons, background supportive settings. no matter what the movies titled, bill murray could only play with his own trademark: a cliched, formatted, stereotyped, fixed character, with deadbeat expressionless poker face, exactly like those faces of all the tropical fish in the fish tank, different species but all with similar expressionless, careless faces. this is not a personal attack but an impression of every movie with him in it. after twenty minutes, i simply fell into a deep coma and slept like a piece of deadwood. the life aquatic with steve zissou or...zizzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz? who cares??!!",2,"[-0.09859735824825155, 0.937404819561772, -0.7687274728157323, -1.0279647494048938, -1.5113085778624469]",0.937404819561772

Like the annoying neighbor who traps the main character in his driveway over and over again, I went into each scene wondering if anything was going to make me laugh.

Jason Bateman's character is nearly vacant enough for Paul Rudd to play.  He owns a company and he doesn't get much from his wife...basically, he's a normal schmuck who isn't all that interesting.  He employs bickering employees who aren't that interesting either.  You would not want to hang with any of these people during or after work.  Milas Kunis is a smokin' hot chick but she's such a despicable person, stealing and scamming from everyone in her path, that I hated her.  So what that she's hot?  Was her hotness supposed to offset what a terrible person she really is?

Ben Affleck plays a shaggy, stupid bartender who somehow tends bar in a Marriott or some upscale place--obviously a place that would never hire an unkempt moron like him.

There's a workplace plot that involves a character getting his privates mutilated and the impending lawsuit that could upset the sale of the company.  Then there's a domestic plotline of a husband setting his wife up for adultery that has absolutely nothing to do with the workplace plotline...and none of this would matter if the film was remotely funny.

You'll see a lot of good reviews here but look for the key words, like ""understated.""  That means that the movie is ""not funny.""  ""Subtle.""  ""Not funny.""

2272,"About 5% of this book is straight memoir. Another 90% is a shaggy dog story told in first person and involving people and some events in Norm Macdonald's life, and the rest is a kind of post-modern wrapping involving commentary from Macdonald's supposed ghostwriter, who has grown to loathe Macdonald and wants the reader to know it.

The parts don't all mix well. MacDonald is famous enough that people will know the highlights of his career  Saturday Night Live, Dirty Work, the Norm Show, but not famous enough for people to know whether or not he's joking when he describes some very dark elements in his childhood, we don't know whether or not he's serious. And while the very idea that child molestation, for example, might be a subject for humor is typical for Macdonald, it doesn't work well in print.

Best sections of the book: a role-reversed description of Macdonald's firing from Saturday Night Live, a catalog of his favorite lines from Weekend Update (one classic from Chevy Chase and the rest Norm's own), and an ironically exaggerated description of Norm's defeat on the television program Star Search in 1990. The book visits some territory familiar from his previous work, including gambling, meeting Satan, and a bit of gay panic.

Even for fans of Macdonald, this might have been best as two books  one with the shaggy dog material and the other more purely factual. The postmodern commentary could go with either, or both.",3,"[0.4172497934366515, 0.9339284351863087, -1.147007189276644, -1.0180709112865367, -1.8661947711302398]",0.9339284351863087

414,"In John Grisham's latest legal thriller, The Confession, he takes on the tough subject of the death penalty.  While it soon becomes clear, as one gets into the book, where Grisham stands on this touchy subject, The Confession is an interesting and entertaining exploration of Texas and death row and what happens when the wrong person is headed for lethal injection; at times the reader is left reminding themselves that this is a work of fiction.

Dont Drumm is an African-American high school football star who in 1998 was accused then arrested for the murder of Nicole Yarber, a white cheerleader whose body was never found, in Sloane, Texas.  It's almost eight years later and he's been on death row even since, and now stands but a few days away from receiving the lethal injection.  Enter Travis Boyette, a creepy old guy with a rap sheep of multiple sex offender convictions who has a massive brain tumor and knows he's not long for this world.  He reveals himself to a Kansas minister, Keith Schroeder, confessing that he killed the girl.  Boyette goes into detail about how he killed her and where he buried the body.  And the race is on to get Boyette to Texas, to get all the lawyers involved and see if they can stop the execution of an innocent man in time.

Grisham does little to defend the death penalty in The Confession, making the book more of a political statement than an entertaining thriller, and yet for readers who wonder what might happen in a situation where the person on death row is clearly innocent, this book will provide a lot of the answers.

This is the lamest show I've ever watched. It's all appearance, no substance.

First of all, we have a lead character that's hardly even likeable; it's a selfish, mean and paranoid guy.

Then, we have plot holes larger than anything I've ever witnessed. Check that bad guy Gaines, for example: to obtain the ID card, he pays one million dollars to a highly professional female killer. To kiddnap the annoying girl Kim, also a substantian part of the bad guy's plan, he hires two stupid and intoxicatd teenage boys! How clever!!

So for the first part of this book, I was really enjoying it. Funny, witty characters, and the mile high club in the making was pretty interesting and entertaining too. But at about the half way mark in the book, you kind of began to get tired of the statement ""it's only a one night stand, doesn't mean anything"".  It also seemed like the characters started to have some disconnect from when the story started out. Just started getting confusing on how the characters were being portrayed, which was a bit disappointing because I was really enjoying the book up until that began. I really liked the horse carriage scene. Gage is pretty dang hot, and given he's a great uncle, he was even a bigger draw.

I loved the well developed characters and their backstory, from another series by the same author ....the friendship and love between them all was charming.... furthermore the relationship between the two main characters was at times romantic and sweet....but here is the thing although this should have been an enjoyable experience in the end I was left dissatisfied for the following reasons...

Firstly, the female antagonist, a strong, successful woman is portrayed as being sexually naive and unfulfilled  but talks openly about sexual matters in settings and with people that seemed unlikely and inappropriate... furthermore many of her decisions and reactions were based purely on her selfish needs and professional status regardless of anyone else's feelings..

Secondly the male antagonist a dominant, successful sports star, who has suffered a great personal tragedy, appears to be reckless in terms of the commitment he puts into his relationships.....and in addition he appears to have some trust issues but conversely is  willing to explore the sexual fantasies of his partner regardless of the content...I can not say anymore without giving the plot away...needless to say, in my opinion, the two main characters were not believable or particularly endearing and in the end this spoiled my enjoyment...

Overall this book was a well written romantic and sexy read but unfortunately there were too many faults with the main characters and the scenario's they were placed in for me to really find it enjoyable...I finished the story but sadly I was disappointed

The snappy dialog was still there and a hero, Trip,  I really liked, despite his womanizing ways and overly cocky attitude. But Kelsey was an issue for me. She was obsessed with marriage and children, but she was her own worse enemy where relationships were concerned. Then, she resented Trip for being exactly what she knew he was...not interested in a relationship.
I also was less than impressed with Avery and Grey...who I assume were the H/h of book one? Grey gave Kelsey a really mean-spirited nickname, which Trip let slip. And Avery seemed judgemental about Kelsey and Trip, even though there were hints to her less-than-stellar relationship with Grey at first.

It was unrelentingly tense for the entire movie, and I came away from it more exhausted than entertained.

""The Dark Knight Rises"" did not make the same mistake. While much of the movie is tense, and often depressing, the mistakes of the previous effort were avoided. There were plenty of tension breaks and brief moments of humor in this film, even during the most critical dramatic scenes. That saved it from being a beat down of the viewer, and allowed me to enjoy the movie without the exhaustion I felt from its predecessor.

This story is epic in scope, and puts the Batman through some paces he's never faced on film before. It certainly reminds me of some of the Limited Series in the comics where he faces failure, both in action and in mind. There is depth here to go with as much action as any action junkie could desire.

Ms. Zanetti picked the perfect heroine, Nessa Lansa from the Council of the Coven Nine. I did not see that pairing, Lol. This is a breathtaking roller coaster ride from the very first page and the surprises just kept coming. Nessa is a healer witch unable to form fire, like the other witches in the realm. She comes up with this bright idea that if she can heal Bear,(because he is actually two forms and he really shouldn't have changed into his other form, but he did to save his sister Simone, and ended up hurting himself on a physiological level) then he needs to mate with her. Bear was like, say what now? Lol. Bear doesn't like witches because there are always hidden secrets, agendas and politics with them and boy was Nessa's secret a HUGE ONE! I won't spoil it. Suffice it to say, I did not see that one coming at all. Great Job, Ms. Zanetti. The action was riveting and I simply could not wait to get to the next page. I hated being interrupted and having to put the book down even once. It is that good! The sex was off the charts and the dominance that Bear showed to even attempt to get Nessa to submit was wonderfully sweet. He is a typical bear, named Bear, too cute, right? Lol.

1679,"I was torn between 3 and 4 stars.  Yes, the book has some flaws, but I enjoyed it more than most ""urban fantasy.""  I should perhaps admit that I do not read vampire books -- the whole vampire thing leaves me cold.  I agree with the comments made by other reviewers:  Eugenie seems to run around without planning ahead or thinking things through.  She is astonished to discover that turning her kingdom from a temperate climate into a desert has caused hardship to its inhabitants.  Hel-lo!

I had a problem throughout with the author's use of time.  Why does everything happen in a day?  Time should elapse more normally; for example, weeks, if not months, should have elapsed between the end of the prior book and the beginning of this one; when Eugenie brings textbooks to the Otherworld, a month or so should elapse before innovations begin to built.

 I could do without the long sex scenes (mostly they make me laugh), but I know that  a lot of people like them.  I actually prefer the ""foreplay"" scenes, such as the  quasi-romantic scenes with Dorian.

On the plus side, like other reviewers, I enjoyed the cast.  Eugenie is sometimes childish, but she is young, and I think part of the story is her learning and making choices (not all of which will be right).  I don't understand why so many readers hate Kiyo.  I don't find it at all off-putting that he is excited over the birth of his child and concerned for Maiwenn; I would despise him if he didn't care.  Eugenie is acting like a child when she complains about it.  And he is not to be despised for being peaceful, and worrying that she will be corrupted by power.  It just comes down to the kind of life one wants.

The world-building was also good as far as it goes (maybe a bit derivative of Amber) but it could use elaboration.  Its rules are not clear.

In sum, it's pretty good, and I hope there is another in the works; Thorn Queen is a whole  year old.",2,"[0.15460440139557163, 0.8886399505929329, -0.289607788321373, -0.99526857620765, -2.4526427303456604]",0.8886399505929329

""Scat"" was my one, and only, foray into Hiaasen's young adult literature and I was sorely disappointed. I imagine this book would not entertain a bright kid. The characterizations are weak, the plot is absolutely ridiculous, and the author tries (unsuccessfully) to pander to his audience. The novel is filled to the brim with references to the latest pop technology (Facebook, YouTube, texting, iPods, etc.) and it gets nauseating. It comes across like the stereotypical geezer trying to relate to those ""darn kids and their rock and roll"". It seems forced, and as a result, ineffective. There is also a lame attempt to integrate the Iraq War and a not very subtle environmental message. It comes across as cloying and obvious, and as I mentioned earlier, a halfway sophisticated young reader will not buy it!
I would recommend you sending the kids to other authors, and letting them come to Hiaasen's adult work later in life. There is much better young adult literature out there.",1,"[-0.43816363555051174, 0.8852406600493771, -1.048865146987009, -1.0337940235435161, -1.4268150913327042]",0.8852406600493771

I'm not particularly a James Patterson fan (I'd only read two of his books previously) but I decided to try this one.  It will make you stop and think about our perilous relationship with animals (domestic and wild) and also with the environment.

The book has Patterson's trademark short chapters...LOTS of them.  It does heighten the suspense because it gives a feeling of fast paced action.  There are a few places that the action seems a bit disjointed and often you feel that interesting parts of the book are raced through and/or not completely resolved.

But given all that, it is still very interesting.  I'd have to say it is not for the squeamish or faint of heart.  If it is made into a movie, they will have to tone down all the ""limbs chewed off"" and ""faces bitten off"" parts!

I did have a problem with the cover.  It shows the Eiffel Tower and the tag line, ""Something bad is happening out there.""  The line is fine.  BUT...while the shadowy Eiffel Town looks ominous, Paris is not an important factor in the book at all.  I kept waiting for the action to go to Paris!

395,"I used to read a lot of these sorts of forensic thrillers, but I guess my tastes have changed as I've aged, because now I read them and can't help but notice that it's a whole genre basically dedicated to the death and mutilation of women and I'm just so very very over it.

Other than the fact that the vast, disproportionate majority of victims in books like this one are female I also struggled through D&eacute;j&agrave; Dead in other areas. I found it dry and a bit on the slow side. There are a lot of technical info-dumps as Temperance talks to various professionals. I thought Temperance did an amazing number of truly stupid things. She was bordering on To-Stupid-to-Live territory. I thought it unlikely that the police would allow her to come along with them as they did. I thought the book's attempt to be edgy by including prostitutes and such just came across as stereotypical. And the book is quite dated (which is not really something it can be faulted for, but still bothered me a bit).

I did really appreciate that Temperance and the detectives were all older people. It's so refreshing to find professionals as experts in their fields who are written as actually old enough to have earned their degrees and the requisite experience to become experts. Not to mention having and dealing with true adult problems. I liked the anthropology. I liked the characters; even the jerks had their moment of redemption. I liked that it's set in Quebec. So, in the end, I'm gonna call this a so-so read and not make any effort to continue the series, but also not boycott it or anything.

I am all about watching a different kind of sci-fi movie and this movie's premise and trailer interested me enough to make me watch.  It had flashes of similarities to a similar story line of ""Hunger Games"" or ""Divergent"" yet had a unique enough premise to draw me into it to watch.

Unfortunately this movie fails to live up to what it promises.  I can get past the whole train setting as kind of nonsensical in the first place but this movie the script itself wanders off the track too many times that it derailed to me early on.  Sometimes books don't translate well into movies and although maybe my lack of familiarity with this story makes it a difficult translation to me, I don't know.  I would just hope that the book has a more cohesive story that what the movie showed.  It is almost that the movie tries too hard to stray out into weirdness territory just to be different.  The basic story is there and underneath the layers it has a lot of potential to be good, but the strange action sequences, weird dialogue and shaky camera shot sequences just left me more annoyed than amused.

This is going to be a movie that some people are going to like for sure with its off center storyline and overall strange feel. It has its messages that it is trying to send, but like the translator in the movie, it didn't get the message very clear to me. I will give it credit for being original and different as for sure that is it what it was.  If you are looking for something out of the norm of the standard type sci-fi then this you may enjoy.  For me, this isn't a terrible film as movie starts to get interesting toward the end but the movie is really hard for me to rate as there were so many things, especially early on that made me dislike the film.",1,"[-0.21362696546587423, 0.867476919445752, -0.5378497669570865, -1.040631749630276, -1.791267367561907]",0.867476919445752

The story was good and the characters well developed. However, regardless of the title, I never found a wager involved. Hmmm...stranger and stranger. Still worth the read.",3,"[0.865950467194194, 0.6459794174164798, -0.3854231785801392, -1.0427571917444036, -1.9744680827748287]",0.865950467194194

9394,"I, like most other viewers, didn't have very high expectations here but was hoping for some good suspense and some scares.  This movie was supposedly based on a true story and I can believe it is.  If you were to write down everything that happens on paper in order it does make sense and could have made for quite a good movie but it just didn't fully succeed.

It grabbed me in at the beginning with the 4 friends videotaping themselves.  I thought it really showed the closeness and bond between them all.  Then we go ahead 5 years and there is a reunion.  I didn't find the characters to be stereotypes but agree you found out little about them.  I thought the actors did very well with what they had.  I did believe the love and commitment between the married couple and found my concentration centering on them and their child.  I found their acting very believable and I felt for them.

I think one reason this film does not work is because a viewer knows it takes place on the sea and danger happens.  One does expect scares but nothing much happens here.  When they first end up in the water with no way back onto the boat I think the film succesfully shows their growing terror and taps into all viewers fear of water and such a situation.  It had me for a little while.  But then the movie was just too long, very little happened and the suspense did not remain.  I believe if the film was better written it could have held the suspense throughout but it just lost steam.

It grabbed me enough that I watched the whole thing and I certainly don't think it was terrible.  The premise was good and as I said before I think the actors did quite well with what they were handled.  But it just could have been so much better.",2,"[-0.7483016946472788, 0.8645558589423438, -0.5646420980061204, -1.0223176382295949, -2.070876314620026]",0.8645558589423438

I was on a complete high with this book.  Ruckus totally blew me away!

Not only was I not expecting for Dean Ruckus Cole to be such a kind, caring gentleman, but he was the best a woman can ask for.  Let's not forget that he was one sinfully hot alpha!

This gut wrenching book had me almost in tears at the end and it was a beautiful ending I wasn't expecting.  I was almost on the verge of cursing the author out when I thought the inevitable had happened.  But she came back and gave me that beautiful HEA.

This book will have you hooked from beginning to end -- no lie!

This series has become one of my top reads of all times!!

What started out as a hot guy knocking her down, turned into a love story that Raven never wouldve imagined! I love how they all have such close friends and they are just as important to the story. Just as you think its gonna be happily ever after things get crazy scary and you're worried about whats going to happen. I cant wait to find out what happens to Raven, Declan, Finn, and the rest of them.

3517,"I came to this book after reading ""The Prettiest One"" by this writer. I found that book quirky and so wanted to see if this one was in the same category. It is.
This book read like a veritable ""Perils of Pauline"" type read. It was in places a laugh out loud read. One l would not be surprised to learn was at times a tongue in cheek odyssey by the author more than a serious read.
For that reason I'm not even going to comment on such things as plot, character development, etc.
But that should not keep you from reading it. You will have a good time. I guarantee it.",4,"[0.8632677639021027, 0.18812751112732806, -1.1130026682762004, -1.0404010405305495, -1.0351081417220114]",0.8632677639021027
