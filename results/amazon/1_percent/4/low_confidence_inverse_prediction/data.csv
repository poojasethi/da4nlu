From the refreshingly romantic cover to the steamy, engaging, heart-melting storyline, this book has it all:  handsome alpha protective hero, beautiful strong, sassy heroine who meets her knight in shining armor.

In fact, this book is what rekindled this avid romance enthusiast interest in reading this genre. Im proud to proclaim myself as one of Bella Andres biggest fans, especially when it comes to this amazing series. Yes, Ive read all 14 books and Im anxiously awaiting Book #15, Now That Ive Found You. With each a stand-alone complete with a HEA, you don't have to read them in order, folks. Just jump in anywhere, but I guarantee you will find yourself wanting to read each and every one..

2022,"First, I would like to extend a heartfelt Thank you to Melissa Jagears and her publisher for sending me a copy of ""A Bride At Last"" to review for them. I am truly grateful for this generosity. I really appreciate the time, effort and expense it takes to make a reviewer copy available to me.

'A Bride at Last' by Melissa Jagears starts as an emotionally charged work of fiction from the very first page which transports the reader back in time where life seemed very different than it is today.  Kate Dawson adores her student, Anthony, and has been caring for him during his mothers illness.  Now that Lucy is gone, Kate is expecting Anthonys father to arrive in town to take the boy and make a home for him.
Silas Jonesey shows up and puts Kate on edge as she confronts the fact that Anthony is going to live somewhere else, but when Richard also shows up and lays claim to the boy, Kate aligns herself with Silas even though Lucy had less than stellar things to say about both men.  Silas and Richard were both summoned by letters from Lucy, so they both believe they are the boys father.

This is a touching love story of a man, a woman and a child with lots of humor.  I laughed out loud as the story played out in my minds eye.  I was also choked up by the touching sentiments expressed in the building of a family.  But the story dragged in spots and there was more conflict than I usually like in a book Im reading to be entertained.  Still, A Bride At Last contains valuable life lessons about love and forgiveness.  I do recommend it.",2,"[-0.8017142384678038, -0.6496357970275072, -0.7610144382663672, -1.0362907637955983, -1.2981499451941745]",-0.6496357970275072

8522,"M/m romance is my current book obsession.  Can't get enough of it.

Tony is that hunka hunka burnin' fireman that any woman (or man!) would want warming their bed.

Dom is the successful businessman, content with his lot in life, though events from the past weigh heavy on his mind - and heart.

When this duo have a chance meeting, they have no idea how much their lives are going to change.

They have that instant attraction/insta-lust thing going on strong.  Both unsure of the other but keen to know more.

Boy, the sparks between this pair fly!  When they find themselves thrown into the same social circles again, you just know that things are going to hot up.

Everyone around them can feel it too, but so much denial between them.  Come on fellas, get your act together and get it on!!

Of course the road to true happiness is never a smoothe one, and boy oh boy do Tony and Dom have their work cut out for them!

Dance with Destiny is more than just a m/m romance.  There are so many other things going on with them that makes their story so believable.

It is more a story of hurt, healing, acceptance.  Ms Johnson deals with these issues in a compassionate and natural way, things don't feel forced and it draws you further into the story. Your heart just hurts along with our lovelies.

There is a complexity to the relationships of all the characters in Dance with Destiny.  Nothing seems to come easy for our pair - mostly through their own distrust, miscommunications, lies and secrets.  Nothing good can ever come from secrets.

One of the biggest things you will get out of this story is what is really family?  Are those that are supposed  to love you unconditionally the ones that always do?  Or is family more than blood

So, can Tony and Dom get past all their issues and forge ahead in their relationship?
For that, you are going to have to read for yourself.

2950,"I loved SHACKING UP so much! It kept me laughing and swooning throughout the book. I saw this one available for download on NetGalley and decided to give a new-to-me author a try. Soooo glad I did. Helena Hunting has a new fan in me!

Ruby Scott was a really strong female lead... a bit zany, quirky, artsy, but tough. She knew who she was and what she wanted and wasn't afraid to get out there and go for it no matter what it took. She also had a soft side which really shone through with how well she cared for Bane's pets. Especially Francesca, who manages a bit of scene stealing. Ruby is the total opposite of Bancroft Mills in so many ways, but one thing they have in common is they both come from wealthy families with expectations for them that neither of them is interested in complying with. Ruby may come from the right kind of family, but she rebels even more so than Bane does, she's not willing to be controlled by anyone. Because of this, and their crazy and instant attraction, they get each other and are perfect together.

Bancroft may be working in the family business now, but he spent seven years rebelling and playing professional Rugby in Europe and only came back to the states because he busted his knee. He's still not willing to settle in with the women his parents choose for him... the ones from the right families, despite their pressure for him to marry. He's a sweet guy at heart, who has a dirty, sexy streak that loves to come out to play. He goes after what he wants, or who he wants, namely Ruby, and he tells her exactly what he wants to do with her. These two just really connect right off and then as they text, call, and video chat so Bane can ""make sure Francesca and Tiny are doing good"" their bond grows even deeper.

Shacking Up is funny and very romantic. I loved Bancroft and Ruby. The banter and the dialogue is perfect between them and with all the characters. This book is just really well-written with a steady pace and excellent supporting characters. The sexual tension really builds while they're an ocean away from each other so when he finally comes home? Wow!! They have some adjustments to make once they're in the same city again, but Ms Hunting works it all out for a beautiful HEA ending. 4.5 stars",3,"[-1.1929841771580505, -2.142161880664665, -0.6537591407648837, -1.0094636805038877, -1.429080385409451]",-0.6537591407648837

Choosing to See is a very touching and honest tribute to little Maria's life and a powerful testimony of God's love for His children.  It is hard to imagine going through the loss that Mary Beth went through and I know it took guts for her to write so honestly about her life and how she dealt with life after Maria.  I was inspired by this family's ability to go on living and for their ability to use their grief for God's kingdom.

Aside from Choosing to See being an inspiring book, it is also very well written and hard to put down.  Mary Beth's story is interesting and you will find yourself wanting to know more about her and how she has dealt with the pain.

1272,"As an unmarried woman of a certain age, Minna needed to earn a living as a ladies' companion or some similar occupation, but when she is relieved of her post, she has no choice but to go live with her sister, Martha, and her brother in law, Sigmund.  As in, Sigmund Freud.  As Herr Doctor Freud is in the midst of his life's work, he begins a passionate affair with his sister in law.  Is Martha aware of this affair?  If Minna must choose between her sister and her lover, who will she choose?

I have to admit, I was completely swept up in this book.  While Freudian theories are no longer in vogue, I have always found them fascinating, and wondered how much of Freud's personal life factored into his work.  I was fascinated by the descriptions of various medical treatments, both for physical ailments and mental health issues, used during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  It really makes you appreciate how far medical science has come, but also how much we were aware of, even so long ago.  I had to giggle at the scenes about cocaine use, particularly how Freud called it harmless and impossible to become addicted.

I really loved the writing in this book.  As with all historical fiction, a lot of liberty was taken with the storyline, I am sure, but I was really enraptured with Minna and Sigmund's characters.  Freud was really written exactly as I would have imagined he would be, and even though he was infuriating, I was really drawn to him.  But I was really enamorate of Minna as a character.  I love that she really pushes back against Victorian female stereotypes.  She refuses to marry out of necessity.  She drinks.  She is an intellectual.  I would bet anything that she would have been a feminist, despite the fact that she falls prey to Freud's spell.

The book does a great job of weaving both fact and fiction into the overall tapestry of the story.  It will appeal to fans of historical fiction, but also to students of psychology, to learn a bit more about Freud from a human perspective, even if it is fictional.",2,"[-0.8510875292276991, -0.6561187474450345, -0.7835085200235625, -1.0123264810049781, -2.09571387852438]",-0.6561187474450345

3411,"Second novel by the two authors about the adventures of a Seal Team that has been deemed ""rogue"" by the U.S. government.  In the first book the team rescued a female downed helicopter pilot from the hands of the Taliban in Afghanistan.  It was done against the direct orders of the president and in spite of it's success caused the members of the group to become outcasts.
  In Target America a Chechen group attempts to smuggle two suitcase nuclear weapons into the United States.  The first one explodes in the smuggling process when the outlaws are caught by U.S. agents attempting to bring it in through a tunnel under the Mexican -U. S. border.  All of the smugglers are killed in the blast, but the American government is made aware of a second one enroute.  The ""special ops"" black unit is activated as one that could have a chance to find the remaining suitcase.  Gil Shannon, the leader of the group and his team utilize any means at their disposal to find the suitcase, and toss out rules stopping them in order to proceed.
  A very well written portion of the book is dedicated to an attack by the terrorists against Gil's ranch and although he is away with the group shows a gathering of citizens running to the defense of his wife and mother in law.  The sacrifices Americans will make to protect each other in time of need is delineated by the authors and is the true American spirit.
  The authors were never Seals, but work with agencies that help those brave men, and via interviews have put together two fascinating books that are as probably as true to life as possible.

Book Two in the Suspicious Hearts series, Waiting for Tuesday, is written by author Taylor Sullivan.  This is a stand-alone novel with a few, small supporting characters from the first book.  Tuesday has not had a stable home most of her life, constantly moving, living the life as a wanderer with her mother.  Shes on her own and wants roots, she wants consistency, a family, love.  The daughter of a single mother, she craves to live her life with the promise of a full family.  John doesnt do relationships, he lives week to week, just pushing through.  His past has deeply impacted him and it follows him.  Yet, when John meets Tuesday, everything changes.

This book certainly pulls your heartstrings.  Its touching, fully emotionally.  It touches on several topics to include: sense of loss, abandonment, abuse, disappointment and more.  Taylor Sullivan ties these all up nicely with a little bow within this novel.  What happens when you have a secret that you know will shatter what you feel is your happily ever after?  Then when it does exactly what you think itll do, how do you move on?

I would have loved to have seen more character development of Tuesday and John, but it doesnt reflect poorly on how this story is written.  I did enjoy reading this story and I thought that Tuesday was definitely a quirky character to go with her name.  She has goals and ambitions, just like most of us and she struggles with making the best decision, though she also knows when she won't compromise.  I give Taylor Sullivan props for how she finishes this story, its not tradition, but its truly perfect for these characters.",1,"[-0.665006973710252, -0.7510445246365433, -0.9116647086777793, -0.9867560327265615, -1.4325450718484325]",-0.665006973710252

2163,"I have to admit that Dan Walsh is a favorite author of mine. His books always hit a special spot deep within, that make me think, and leave lasting thoughts, long after I have finished reading the book. This newest book was certainly no exception. It met every criteria that I have for a  meaningful storyline.

The characters were realistically and well described. In fact, they became part of my family. I easily identified with Judith and felt her every pain, challenge, disappointment as well as her joys and satisfactions. She was the mother that I hope that I become, one day, dedicated to her children . Her husband, Stan, was a sensitive, caring man who desperately wished for happiness for his wife. If this meant he would have to give up a dream, he was ready and willing. This love was evident in his every action. What a wonderful marriage they had!!

The plot moved slowly but steadily. There were just enough surprising twists and turns to keep the reader engrossed in the tale. I must say that I did wish at times that events would happen more quickly, however , part of the appeal of the book, was that you had to wait for God's plan to be accepted and He had to be allowed to work out the challenges in a satisfying way.

Any reader who loves happily ever after books would adore this book. It is a story which whom every parent can identify. We want our children to become independent, however , that comes with disappointments to a mom and dad. Should it???? No , but we are human . Dan Walsh addresses this difficulty in a sensitive and caring way.

I highly recommend this book for all readers of Christian fiction. Uplifting and restores our faith in human nature!!!

Penny couldn't be with someone who didn't trust her to tell her everything and that was why she walked away from the man she loved.

This is the second book in the Falling Fast series by Ms. Wainscott.  It's set in the small beach town of Chambliss, Florida.
It's been seven years since Gemma Thornton had left heartbroken and frightened. She's back because her dad was seriously injured in an accident and in the ICU.  She is extremely frustrated when she has a flat tire on her way into town. Gemma is struggling to get the spare out of the trunk when a Good Samaritan pulls up. It is one of the people she hoped to not see on her return to town.

Pax Sullivan finds a "" damsel in distress"" on the side of the road. He stops and immediately recognizes Gemma, the young girl now woman who.....""had wreaked havoc on him and his family."" They are polite to each other, he helps with the tire and she is on her way. Gemma remembers Pax when she was fresh from New York, shy, nervous and friendless. She is introduced to him at a road rally and is immediately attracted. Sadly, she  realizes if she wants to to make friends, she needs to steer away from the bad boys. She ends up dating Pax's older brother Wade, football star, popular and one of the in crowd. The boy who would ruin her life.

Gemma and Pax are thrown together a lot. Pax is partners with her Dad, Wade, and is taking care of all the arrangements after the accident. He and Wade are also working to get the old racetrack in town up and running. He is staying at Wade's B&B to protect the property and Gemma. They call a truce from the past, and actually start talking to each other. Suddenly, they realize they are not on opposite sides. Pax is seeing the real Gemma, she's not a liar, grasping for attention at all. Slowly they realize that this is more than just an attraction. He sees she is a little broken inside  and gently shows her what they have is the real thing.

This can be read as a stand alone novel, the characters from Falling Fast, Raleigh and Mia, blend into the story easily. It's a twist on a friends to lovers story and focuses on a serious topic, date rape. I highly recommend this thought provoking novel.

The saga which is highly astonishing and truly amusing continues with this amazing series ""The Chicago Syndicate"". The last book announced that Adriano is the boss and Luca is the underboss. The other books sparely mention Richard Wade( Logan), a CIA in ""For Fallon"" now working for both the Syndicate and CIA. Wade is a very handsome, dangerous, mysterious, forbidden bad boy seeking for a position in the Syndicate to support his Nana and I just love the mystery and arrogance that he possesses. Rosalia Calderon is the younger sister to Cam and guess who is given the position to babysit her? Yeap! Logan. Rosa is a party-hog, strong-will young lady with her own demons but was kept safely away from the family activities until she forced herself into it. The sexual tension between Logan and Rosa was sizzling hot at times like a grill full of hot charcoal. This story was so intense that I was totally enthralled by the adventure full of action violence, betrayal, secrecy, mayhem and destruction. James demeanor was a surprise and what a shock to the brain to see the change! The different angles the author took with this story was aberration from your usual mafia organization yet explosive!

This author has been consistently outstanding in plot development, character development, and rising action leading to anti-climax and resolution throughout the series. I don't re tell story lines in my reviews, but suffice it to say, chief protagonist Jack Swyteck, Miami criminal defense lawyer is as interesting a character as Harry Bosch is in the Connelly series.

This book and series deserve all the stars!

This book was everything I've come and know and expect from the lovely Lauren Blakely AND MORE. Patrick and Mia have been circling around each other for a while now and finally it's their turn to find their HEA. Why have they waited so long? Well, distance was the biggest issue as one lives in New York and one lives in San Francisco. Further to that, while distance was certainly a factor for them, there was also the minor detail of Patrick being Mia's brothers best friend. You may remember one of my (ahem, many) boyfriends, Max? Yeah, him.

As Chase and Max's sister, we've gotten to know bits of Mia: she's loyal, fun, a pocket-rocket! She's gorgeous and Patrick sees it! Patrick is our successful, cat-loving outdoorsman who is, in his own words, a unicorn. And no, he's not just talking about the length of his horn (suuuuuuure, he's not). No really, he's ready to settle down. He wants to be with The One. And that one is Mia.

Oh God. This book. So sweet, so lovely, such a gorgeous progression of friendship. I love that the romantic relationship between Patrick and Mia was built on a solid friendship with all the respect and love thrown in aaaaall the way through to the end. Hard Wood is the final book in the Big Rock series - all of which can be read as standalones. So being the last book, reading it was kind of bittersweet for me. The characters in these books have become like friends - no, family! - to me and to say goodbye to them leaves me feeling more than a little sad. All the characters we've come to know and love throughout the series make an appearance in Hard Wood and Blakely comes a full-circle, tying up all loose ends and finishing off a series beautifully.

6362,"Funny, sexy, heartbreaking and beautiful, Deliverance (NYC Doms #1) is a wonderful read and a very exciting start to this new series. To begin I loved this well written book and it's engaging storyline. It will grab your attention from the first chapter and not let go of it. The characters are well developed and have complex histories. Diana, is an amazingly real character. Feisty, strong and a loving mom to a special needs son. From the very first scene with her you can not help but feel a connection with her. And even if you have never taken things quite as far as she did, you will have felt her feelings and if you are honest at least fantasized about taking some kind of action because of them. Tobias, is a strong, sexy, determined and dominate alpha male. The way these two first meet is priceless. It's part heartbreaking, part laugh out loud funny with a heavy dose of awe inspiring train wreck horror tossed in. In my opinion this meeting alone is worth the price of the book. I adored the romance between these two. The attraction is intense, the chemistry hot and the scenes scorching. The book also offers plenty of emotional depth, mystery and danger.

This is the story of James Drake and Isabella Grayson. James is an early aviation pioneer trying to win the race to be the first to fly across the English Channel. Isabella is not a typical young lady for this time in history. She wants more than a home and marriage. She wants to be a journalist and write articles about all of the aviation pioneers. She makes a bet with her parents-if they let her write a series of articles for her father's newspaper she will get married in a years time. This is how she meets James and becomes involved in his aviation career.

But he's only recently returned to England to assume the title after the deaths of his father and older brother who were nasty, despotic pieces of work who left him with a lot of ill-will towards his name.  Lucien understands, he's not at all sorry they are dead and gone.  His father had kicked him out many years before and he's had to make his way from poverty in Shanghai where he built his own trading company and reached prosperity--with the help of his right-hand man Merrick.

The book opens with Lucien under a super-natural attack threatening to kill him.  He and Merrick learned about magical attacks in the Far East, so they seek the English equivalent of a Shaman to aid them.  Stephen Day is such a man.  Unfortunately, he has also an axe to grind against the Vaudreys.

The action is fast-paced.  Lucien/Crane has a distinct, amusing voice that is fun to experience.  The writing has an obvious ease and assurance.  I was pleasantly surprised.  This immediately felt like a book I wanted to curl up with and enjoy.

Julia & Jaxson are first and foremost friends, their bond is truly unbreakable and K.C Lynne develops their characters so well that when they blur those lines you're doing a cheerleading dance in your head rooting for them (or is that just me??) Julia has her heart shattered to pieces but she puts on her big girls panties and carries on with her head held high with as much dignity as she can muster!

When Jaxson breezes back into town all set to get his girl the results are both hysterical & HOT!!!
Julias no pushover but she's also no match for all that Alpha macho Jaxson has going on either #noshamethere
They are both fighting their own demons and issues but do they each have what the other needs to get their happy ever after, whilst beating back the drama that seems to be following them whatever they do?

Above the Bridge gave me a insightful look into this series and into the life of Paige MacKenzie as she arrives in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

5304,"Monica Stevens works for BelleCurve in Bellevue, Washington for the past 3 years. She guards her past tightly and hates to let many get close to her. She loves her job but seeks a more creative position within the company and is known for her artistic abilities.

Zachary Ryan is the NFL Quarterback of the local Seattle team and one of the most eligible bachelors. Yet something draws him to Monica no matter how much she pushes him away. Zachary knows that football won't last forever and knows he wants to be known for something off the field as well.

As Monica and Zachary begin to get closer and form a friendship, Monica realizes what is truly at stake for her. Unfortunately she is not the only one with an interest in Zachary and will her past be used against her and force her to lose everything?

I really enjoyed this book! This is the second one in the series and although it can be read as a stand alone I do advise reading Up In The Treehouse first as you get to know Monica better.

I really liked Monica in the first book and in this book we get a real sense of the anguish that she feels with losing her dad and where all the hurt comes from and why she feels torn with her mom. I felt so bad for Monica and completely understand why she keeps her heart guarded and why she was scared about entering a relationship with Zachary. I felt so bad for Monica with everything she went through with Meredith, Zachary's publicist and not knowing what was happening with her job.

Zachary was awesome and really overcame his own bullies and demons from Under The Bleachers. He did so with the help of Coach Reynolds who saw something in him and helped him overcome everything. Zachary also had a business that he knew he could fall back on and I loved through the story learning about his relationship with Desmond. He was definitely a great guy but I found him a little gullible with Meredith and I didn't see how he didn't understand what she was doing.

I did guess how everything was going to play out and then after I felt so bad for Monica when she learned the truth about what her mom did as well and the lies that were told. I hated that Monica blamed herself for so long over what happened.

This is a great series on forgiveness and learning to love!

Phoenix is a computer hacker and a money launderer, and although his contacts are mostly with criminals, he's a good guy at heart.

What starts like just a routine mission becomes so much more when sparks fly between Kennedy and Phoenix. But with so many secrets between the two of them, is their personal relationship doomed from the beginning?

One part spontaneous heroine, one part super meticulous and organized hero, and you've got the makings for a pretty spectacular read. Gracie is as crazy as her hair, and James just doesn't need that in his life.

He does enjoy bickering with her, though.

The thing is, his siblings are starting to take the bickering as sexual tension -- and while yeah, sure, James is attracted to the spitfire baker, but she does not need to know that.

These two were so much freaking fun. I loved the fighting and the bickering at the beginning, but my favorite, oh my, my favorite part, was when James finally lost his cool and unraveled, showing the man has moments where things aren't lined up so neatly.

...I also loved it when his brothers called him ""Jimmy"" because the moniker just doesn't seem to fit the professor, and it gives a little insight into the studious James, the Donovan brother who didn't quite fit in with the others growing up.

I loved getting inside James's head -- he keeps an awful lot about himself under lock and key, including the fact he can be pretty protective & possessive, two qualities I didn't think we'd get out of this man.

It is an epic love affair, spanning over 40 years.  So much honesty and devotion.
Avery and Kane are meant for each other.  The attraction is there, as well as a passion that moves them through so many points in their lives.  Happy and devastating.  Through heartbreaking lows and blissful highs the love is astonishing.  They are best friends and their banter is incredible.  Another aspect that felt real was how each of them filled the need of the other-always putting the other first,  taking turns being strong and needing the strength.  Neither of them is perfect-but together they are determined to make it work.

755,"Tenley and Birdie in many ways are versions of each other in another era. At least at their core. When it comes to love. When it comes to their mothers. Connected through time via one man, a host of novels and a writing desk, Birdie and Tenley have a story for all of us. And then of course there is Elijah. And Jonas. Two men, separated by time and about as opposite from one another as can be. Yet they too are connected through the women they love  and through the men of integrity that they are. Rare in Elijahs time. Rare in our own.

Two stories. Two women. Connected by time and separated by it, all at once. Tenleys wit and adorableness (in spite of her searching heart) endears readers immediately, and Jonas ability to wit right back seals the deal. Her growth through the story is skillfully and gently penned, the simplicity of grace vibrant against the backdrop of faith. The Writing Desk is fun, tender, heartwarming, and inspiring. All wrapped up in a captivating story that youll want to hug when finished reading. (Dont ask me how I know this.) One of Haucks best, and thats a high standard to meet since everything she writes is exquisite. This one will be on my favorites list for years to come!

To save her Clan, Mackenzie is to be married to Chief Kirkpatrick of Clan Tiegan;  she has to do her duty, but Chief Kirkpatrick makes it known that he will enjoy breaking her spirit.  Before he gets that chance, Mackenzie is rescued by Thor, who tells her that it was her mothers wish that she be part of the Clan of the Wolf.  Mackenzie has been born a wolf and it is Thors bite that frees her;  not only that she is his hjarta and he has spent a long time looking for her. Mackenzie somehow knew she was different, and finding out she is a wolf just seemed right.  Mackenzie goes back to her Clan to retrieve her mothers sword and shield and her father tells her more about the history of her mother and her achievements.  With the help of Freya, her wolf side, Mackenzie tames the Revenaugh, a great beast that roams the northern woods, slaying anyone that crosses his path.  Chief Kirkpatrick returns to do battle against her fathers Clan, but does not heed the warnings Mackenzie gives him, with dire consequences;  he learns that for all the pain and misery he has caused, she will take from him what he has taken from others  his life.

6207,"I received a complimentary copy of this book from the author. This is my voluntary and honest review.

With each of the Fractured Farrell books, the hero has been my favourite. However Nathan is DEFINITELY my favourite! Whilst Relentless follows the same pattern as the other Farrell books, it is in line with the legacy left them by their despicable father, Walter. The name Farrell and Trouble go together, so when Nathan decides to go and find Katy to reconnect with her, he immediately recognises the attempts at sabotage as being more sinister than at first appear. Katy is so busy trying to deal with the fallout, that despite the immediate flame of desire, really doesn't have time for an over-controlling Farrell in her life.

Nathan's catalyst moment when he realised that his life is meaningless, is interesting because it isn't dramatic or explosive. So many times it only takes a small but significant moment for a person to realise that something has to change. Nathan recognises his moment and goes  for change in the same way that he has pursues all previous activities - with determination.  Despite Katy's attempts to deter Nathan, he nevertheless recognises the answering flame in Katy's eyes and that gives him the courage to push through the barriers she puts up.  As the pressure increases, Katy finds that Nathan is the one person she can rely on, when he comes to her rescue. But, and it's a big ""But"", Nathan remains a Farrell and Katy isn't at all sure that she can trust him.

860,"This is so beautifully and skillfully written. Ursula returns again and again to the same life in pre-WWI England, each time meeting a different fate and demise, depending on slight shifts in her choices or events. I hesitate to summarize it this way however, because this is much like the descriptions I originally read, and that prevented me from ordering the book the first 10 times Amazon suggested it to me. I was afraid it would be too repetitious and tedious, and I look for enthralling reads, especially in the summer.

I am so glad I finally gave in and bought this, as I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and was pulled in every second. The author has deftly structured this so that she never repeats anything - even though we read about the author's birth countless times, each time it is from a different character's perspective, and this always adds something new to our understanding. Ursula's family members remain the same in all versions of her life, so we become attached to them, as we become attached to Ursula. As Ursula gradually realizes what is happening, she begins to take control of her fate, and choose the outcome to some extent (or really, the 'theme' of the book, such as there is one, is to what extent we can or can't control the outcome, and what a desired outcome is anyway.) The different versions of her life read like brilliant short stories, each one pulling you in. Then in the next 'story', she changes one thing, and the rest of her life branches out in a new direction.

It's all very hard to explain really - you have to experience it. It's not reincarnation, as she is in the same life in the same place and time period, and the larger historical events of WWI and WWII are the immovable backdrop that Ursula struggles to live against and within. You could say it's an exploration of how our own lives intersect with the larger world, and how much control each of us does or doesn't have over our fate, but this makes it sound more philosophical than it is. This isn't a theoretical book, it's an experiential one, and that's what makes it so great.",2,"[-1.2615448630072907, -0.7206376173409915, -0.7390140244267573, -0.9979666740476797, -1.6974073995706571]",-0.7206376173409915

I tore through this book once I hit the 65% mark I couldn't turn the pages quickly enough! I loved the pace to this book El Jefe doesnt just forgive and forget. He makes you work for his forgiveness. That first naughty scene at the pool was off the charts hot!! The struggle of Draco not wanting it and trying not to enjoy and Gia just taking what she wanted, what she needed. It was great!! Id totally rate all the scenes from an 8 to 10 with that first one seriously being off the charts HOT!

At 65% when Gia walks down the stars loaded down for war... Draco's response makes me giggle. A love struck idiot! Love it! Those little things lightened up the book at bit and, for me, really added a nice element to it. I think my absolute favorite thing of this book is the dual POV. I LOVED finally getting inside Dracos head its totally dark and cold in there though!

I love Jen!! She's so sweet. I'd be super interested to read a spinoff story on her. Now, Clark Clark was an acquired taste and it took a while for me to like him. Once we got the end and he showed a bit of a softer side for Patanza, that might have been when I started being ok with Clark!

They travel as a band on a tour bus, with Lizzies dear friends that are brothers, Jarrett and Rhett, along with her Uncle Bruce as the driver.  She lives for this life and the band.
  Cannon Blackwell comes into the story as a hot musician left alongside the highway with nothing but his duffel bag and guitar.  The band is in need of a musician so Lizzie saunters over inviting Cannon to be part of the band, as long as he passes a security check and drug test.  He is up for an adventure so agrees.  This is one outspoken, sexy, fun, flirty guy that can be pushy when required.  Could Cannon be real enough to help Lizzie let go of her past and move forward with her future and happiness?
  Lizzie is a feisty, hilarious, controlling lead of the band and over protective Mama Bear to the guys.  She becomes Cannons siren drawing him in and his effect on Lizzie is calming.  They start out as friends quickly moving a bit too fast to the next stage when you consider the timeline of the story.  She is still guarded but love and true friendship prevails.

Two families, one from Maine and one from South Carolina, end up having a connection.
The main character Merritt, after her husbands death, moves to South Carolina from Maine when she inherited his ancestral home. Here begins the story of many different lives, she, Merritt, trying to start over and wanting solitude, but others needing her to connect with them, help them piece together parts  of the past for reasons you will find out.

And then, a chance encounter with a beautiful girl at a charity ball leaves him smitten. Beverly Whitfield is a great girl, she went through a lot while in high school and is a bit apprehensive about other people (specially men) and their intentions. But after meeting Dane she realizes that there is something there she can't deny. There's one little problem she sees with Dane, while he loves golf, she hates it, thanks to her parents always putting her second to the sport.

I loved the slow build of their relationship and the changes we start seeing in Dane almost right away after he meets Beverly. When he defends her at the club....can we say a man worth swooning for? That was one major thing for me to love him even more. Also, you have to love a man who loves his family to the point you can feel it, and Dane adore his. And Beverly, that girl had a heart of gold, helping her kids at the school but also giving her time to the shelter was just incredibly sweet and made her more ""human"" to me. My heart broke for her because I understood exactly what she went through in high school, some things you tolerate them but you never forget the pain they caused and that never goes away, bringing some insecurities to the surface.

The sexiness that exudes from Dane, the magnificent beauty (inside and out) that Beverly shows, the angst, and the incredible love that you feel between them, make the story a beautiful journey between two people who didn't thing they could change their ways. This was a great read and I'm looking forward to Dane's sister story.",1,"[-0.9651335351625359, -0.8355889945061962, -0.729498463911384, -1.0240871619752099, -1.7981039495481734]",-0.729498463911384

The story line is well paced, and it revolves around two men playing Nan. She thinks both men are interested in her romantically when, in reality, she is just a job. They need information about a crime boss, Franco, and they think Nan can tell them what they need to know.

Its clear that Nan is not a beloved character in this series, but I couldn't help but feel for her as these two men toy with her affections. She desperately wants to find the love and intimacy that her brother, Rush, and his wife found in one another. However, poor Nan seems to look for love in all the wrong places.

Jason Guthrie is a good guy, who does a lot of things for a lot of people. He loves working with his hands, fixing things up, and hes good at it. But Honor is determined to do things on her own and while Jason wishes like hell shed let him help, he cant help but admire her tenacity to do things on her own. Shes nothing like the women hes known before, and everything about her intrigues him, but the secrets shes hiding make him leery to get too close and then determined to find them all out.

Though Honor and Jasons romance is the primary focus of this book, there is a side romance for Honors best friend Lexie and one of the other men living in the neighborhood. Youll have to read it to find out who, but I can safely say I enjoyed their romance a lot, too.

Another thing I enjoyed about this book was all the different kinds of relationships that went on in this book. From brothers to pseudo sisters, the love and support these characters each gave to one another was a true delight to read and once again reminded me why I love Lori Fosters work so much. Shes the master at creating meaningful relationships not only between men and women, but also between friends, siblings, and families, both the ones you're born into and the ones you make for yourself. And I love them all!

A wonderful contemporary romance with amazing characters, set in a fantastic community that I so enjoyed getting to know, Dont Tempt Me is a book filled with family, friendship, angst, passion, a sense of belonging, courage, and love. I thoroughly enjoyed the read and am seriously looking forward to the next book in this series.",0,"[-0.8443108383969058, -0.7340562739359026, -1.1284438066247608, -1.0165029758951938, -1.4097527024766419]",-0.7340562739359026

784,"The crime/thriller genre has expanded significantly over the years, seeing the development of some terrific authors. Steve Hamilton is one of them--a terrific writer with the ability to create memorable characters and compelling action. Hamilton's latest, The Lock Artist, is the story of Michael, a teenager who hasn't spoken since a traumatic incident in his childhood.

Michael may be silent verbally, but his story is a tremendously vivid one. Learning how to pick locks--keyed locks, combination locks, safes, etc.--at a very young age, he becomes a valuable commodity in the crime world. His first brush with the law brings him into contact with Amelia, a beautiful young girl whose father is in a great deal of trouble. Michael and Amelia fall in love, and in order to save her, he agrees to help those people whom her father owes. This decision sets him on a destructive path where he is forced to make some important choices that will dictate his future--and whether or not he will ever see Amelia again.

I thought this book was great. Although Michael is unapologetic about his transgressions, I still found myself rooting for him and a happy ending for him and Amelia. The story jumps back and forth between the past and the present, and at times it is a bit confusing to keep the incidents straight, but that is a tiny bit of criticism for a novel that kept me engaged from start to finish. Steve Hamilton is definitely an author worth following, and once you read The Lock Artist, you should definitely check out his series of books featuring Michigan PI Alex McKnight.",0,"[-0.7374071723980298, -1.3211742760958387, -0.7366977253711599, -1.0515860911935166, -1.3657948476850408]",-0.7366977253711599

The book starts with Tia and Nathan, Tia tells Nathan she is pregnant with his child, he wants her to 'take care of it', she gives it up for adoption instead.  Five years later Juliette, Nathans wife and mother of his two sons, finds out there is another child in the picture. Caroline and Peter are the adoptive parents. Caroline is a research doctor and Peter has his own company and they are happy even though Caroline has a hard time in her role as mother but they provide a wonderfully stable home for 5 year old Savannah.

The lives of Tia, Nathan, Juliette, Caroline and Peter are intertwined in this story of infidelity, love, and it all revolves around Savannah.

59,"Once in a great while an author comes along who writes such beautiful, elegant prose that it hardly matters if the plot of the book is at all interesting. When the story being told is also insightful and intriguing, the gift being given to the reader is beyond price. Thank you, Joseph O'Neill, for this wonderful novel.

In its relatively few pages (around 250, at a time when so many authors are so long-winded), Netherland includes an examination of love and loss, a vivid look at the New York City not seen by tourists, the exuberant and somewhat tragic story of one man's pursuit of the American dream, and much discussion of the game of cricket.

The plot: Hans van den Broek from Holland is a stock analyst working in London when he learns of the murder of an American man who was once his friend. He remembers the time when he was living in New York City and his wife took their small son and returned to her parents' home in England in the aftermath of 9/11. Lonely and adrift, Hans found some solace in playing cricket, the game of his youth, with immigrant Americans from countries where cricket is loved. He formed an unlikely friendship with Chuck Ramkissoon, a charismatic Trinidadian who introduced him to a different New York City from the one he had known.

O'Neill effortlessly and seamlessly moves between scenes from his youth, from his time in America, and his present in England. His Ramkissoon character has unmistakeable echoes of The Great Gatsby, but one has no sense that this is a ""rip off,"" more of a homage perhaps. The ending is impressive. I would give it 5 stars, but I try to reserve that for books which are, or should become, classics. The subject matter here is perhaps too esoteric for that. But otherwise....",0,"[-0.7785371340048677, -0.9190999847543783, -0.7410783202320739, -0.9980042016872701, -2.045972653440065]",-0.7410783202320739

Reading this novel, I remembered again that feeling I had when I once again gave everything, including my dreams to the Savior who loves me more than anyone could. I too, prayed that I could carry that feeling of euphoria into my daily life and that it would change the way I looked at life around me. And as I read, I determined once again to make that commitment without fear or anxiety.
We as a family just came through an amazing miracle ourselves when our Mom survived an emergency surgery after a colon in-fracture at the age of 86 years. Having spent 6 weeks in a hospital environment with her, I found the scenes describing the interactions of nurses and doctors as well as administrators  to be very revealing. Never having been to the Holy Land, I traveled there with Emily and Amanda and feel that if I ever did go, I would recognize the streets, the market places and most important of all, visit Bet Jola, and the house of Miriam.
Would I recommend this to my friends? Although I read this as an ebook, I will be buying the print version and making sure that everyone has a chance to read it.

2198,"Ann Shorey in her new book, ""Where Wildflowers Bloom"" Book One in the Sisters At Heart series published by Revell takes us to the town of Noble Springs, Missouri in 1866
From the Back Cover:  far will she go to follow her dreams?

The Civil War stole a father and brother from Faith Lindberg-as well as Royal Baxter, the man she wanted to marry. With only her grandfather left, she dreams of leaving Noble Springs, Missouri, and traveling west to Oregon to start a new life, away from the memories that haunt her. But first she must convince her grandfather to sell the family's mercantile and leave a town their family has called home for generations.

When Royal Baxter suddenly returns, Faith allows herself to hope that she and Royal will finally wed. But does he truly love her? Or will another man claim her heart?

How do we handle the trials and setbacks that occur in our lives?  Some of us just want to run away from them, go somewhere different and start all over with a clean slate.  However life just doesn't work like that as Faith Lindberg finds out.  God would rather redeem the place where we have had our pain and setbacks and show His power and mercy than allow us to run away.  This also allows Curt Saxon to deal with his post traumatic stress disorder from his days in the army during the Civil War.  ""Where Wildflowers Bloom"" also deals with women and how they are treated in the world of business and medicine and the prejudice they faced.  Ms. Shorey is an excellent writer and makes all her characters believable and you care deeply for them as she deftly unfolds the plot before us. This is a nice romance with great themes.  What a wonderful way to start a series.  I look forward to the next book.

The three novellas featured in this book were previously published in the other Amish compilation books An Amish Christmas, An Amish Gathering, and An Amish Love.  I have read all three of those books already and in my humble opinion I think these stories represent the best of all three of those books.

I have always had a somewhat iffy relationship with Amish fiction.  I either really love it or I don't like it at all.  I try to like every Amish story I read, but sometimes they just fall short.  Beth Wiseman is one of the authors that I find very enjoyable.  She writes in a relaxing and uplifting manner and all three of the novellas  in Healing Hearts are written in her signature style that appeals to readers like me.

Hilarious.
There is not other word to describe this book.
Soraya is colourful, funny and Graham is too serious and dark. She finds his phone on the train but when she tries to give it back to him, his behaviour is not the best. But he is intrigued by this woman.
This couple is a perfect mix. He reminds me of Christian Grey (insert sigh) and she is like Bridget Jones.
He has never pursued a woman before. And Soraya is determined to make him work for her.

My Review:

I had not read this authors work before so backtracked and read Unsettled as well as Surrounded.  Oh happy day, as I scored twice as hard!  I am stunned to see these are Ms. Ellingtons first novels as they are both excellent reads, well written, and expertly crafted.  I found the story to be moving as well as humorous, and to be far more than just entertaining.  The characters were well developed and people I would want to know - well - most of them anyway.  The first book was exceptional but the second was even better. The love story was touching, the family issues were relevant, the love scenes were sizzling, and the ending a perfect HEA  I am such a happy camper.",0,"[-0.8930007028756175, -1.3842754911964645, -0.758319203841883, -1.0433515355308813, -1.0551182192320936]",-0.758319203841883

8301,"Series:  Destiny #1
Category /Genre:  NA, Paranormal Romance
Received from:  Deanna Chase (in exchange for an honest review)
Recommended for:  18+ due to sexual content
Grammar/editing:  A  near perfect

This is the first book in the Destiny series.  It does stand alone (no cliffhanger).

In this unique world written by Deanna Chase, there is a soul mate for each person.  Your soul mate will be the other half of your magical team.  For Seth and Elena, together they create masterpieces in oil paints.  Seths parents are master gardeners.  For Lucy and Cadan, its music.  When they sing, the audience is filled with indescribable joy.  Unfortunately, being a soul mate does not guarantee happiness with each other.  Lucys mother and her soul-mate seem to only have the gift of discordance, Cadan is a grade A ass, and Seth has lost Elena in a car accident and blames himself.  How will Lucy choose between her soul mate and the man she loves?

I loved this story and could not put it down.  The story is kept at a quick pace and continually moving forward towards the decisions that need to be made.  Lucy has the largest decisions.  Can she take the leap of faith to trust another person or will she allow the past hurts by others flavor her life forever?  Can she choose love over destiny?

I look forward to continuing this series.  Im hoping the next story has Lucys best friend, Jax, finding her soul-mate.  She has been such a loyal friend to both Lucy and Seth; she deserves her own HEA.",3,"[-1.1105714866107408, -1.983118390426566, -1.2488292435713286, -1.045800025825484, -0.7594568638161899]",-0.7594568638161899

This is the first book in the Von Wolfenberg Dynasty and follows the children of Blythe FitzRam and Deiter Von Wolfenberg who we met in Carried Away part of the Montbryce

Brandt Rodermark is ordered to represent the Duke of Francony, Conrad Staufen and his brother at the wedding of Johann Von Wolfenberg, the son of the Duke of Saxony's most loyal vassal and the hero of two decisive victories in the war against Conrad and Lothair, the emperor, that lead to a reconciliation between them. He is wary as he knows that he could be a target for who knows what as even though there is peace there are still those who bear grudges.

When he arrives he sees Sophia Von Wolfenberg, the sister of the groom and this is where the story begins, I won't go into detail as I don't want to give any spoilers, all I will say is that from here you'll be swept away, follow them on their course, there is an injury and healing that bring them closer and so much more.

2777,"All This Time is the last book in the Walker family series, and while Im a bit sad that its over, Raegans (and Bears!) story wrapped things up beautifully. I usually say that Melissa Tagg is one of my favorite contemporary fiction authors, which is still true, but after reading this series and loving this family, I can honestly say she is one of my favorite authors, period. Her characters are so memorable; I love their interactions and have especially enjoyed the different ways each sibling interacts with the other. When Logan and Raegan had a heart to heart, oh my, it was just so sweet but also realistic.

Throughout the course of this series, Maple Valley became a real place to me and the Walker family real people. Their interconnected stories have been both humorous and poignant, and each bring up a unique issue or conflict within the story. Raeghans story is no different. Though Raeghan loves Maple Valley, she has been hiding a secret her family that has kept her tied down and afraid to leave. Bears past has kept him tied down emotionally, and despite traveling all the way to Brazil, he cant outrun his past. Something that really drew me into the story was the predicament of Bears family. His nephew and niece tugged at my heart strings. Ive also always found Raeghan to be the more mysterious of the Walker siblings, so I loved getting her perspective on things. The two of them separately are intriguing, layered characters. Together, they are just utterly adorable. Their bond feels realistic because they were friends for so long, and Tagg definitely captures the tender shift from friendship to something deeper.

There is just something cozy and lovable yet realistic about these stories. Tagg excels at creating characters evoke empathy, situations that feel unique but universal to the human experience, and romances that simmer with both tension and sweetness. Though sadness is realistically portrayed, hope is always present. I recommend the entire Walker family series to readers of contemporary, inspirational fiction. And do start from the beginning. While I suppose this could be read as a standalone, I think that there is something special to building up to the last book after being with the Walkers for so long.",1,"[-1.4097317894895087, -1.0016167723210043, -0.7631122981489238, -1.0304185469518745, -1.0789506854235729]",-0.7631122981489238

Shortly after the case gets underway a masked gunman  bursts into the court room on a mission to kill. Assuming the judge is the target, Crawford dives on top of judge Holly Spencer to try and protect her from being shot. Not realizing his instincts may have just helped him lose his chances of getting his daughter back...

After it's discovered that they got the wrong guy in the case, Crawford sets out on his own investigation to catch the killer still at large, and tries to do everything in his power to protect Holly and his daughter from the danger that is lurking...

They have such great care for each other though, even though there's plenty of sexual chemistry its easy to see that there is so much more than that drawing them together.

8839,"OMG!!! What an amazing start to a brand new series by Lauren Layne.

From This Day Forward is a novella and a prequel to Lauren Layne's The Wedding Belles Series. This is a series that is going to revolve around wedding planners in New York.

Being that this was a novella, it is a very quick read, but let me tell you, it lacked for nothing. We got laughs, hurt, sex, and love. This is also a second chance romance story. As always Lauren's writing was fantastic and I truly have to say I think this might turn into my favorite series by her. This novella sucked me in and I didn't stop until I was finished. I truly hope we see more of Jason and Leah in the future books of this series.

As I said this is a second chance romance between Jason and Leah. Leah and Jason are both wedding photographers in New York and work closely with the ladies of the Wedding Belles planning agency. When the head of the agency calls Leah to talk, she knows it will be important. Leah is asked by Alexis to help cover the wedding of the former president's daughter that weekend. Leah knows this is the opportunity of a life time and can't say no, even after she finds out that Alexis has also hired Jason....her ex boyfriend from a year ago. To say things ended well is an understatement. So to say that Leah isn't happy about the situation would be putting it mildly. Will Jason and Leah ever get past the past and learn to love and forgive each other?? You'll have to dive into this book to get that answer!!!

We are also introduced to Alexis and Heather who work for the Wedding Belles wedding planning agency. I am assuming that the future books will be about these two and one other that we didn't meet. I know I am looking forward to reading all the books in this series.

So if you are looking for that short, fun and sexy second chance romance book, pick this one up once it releases, you won't be sorry!! You truly can't go wrong with a Lauren Layne book!!! I know that when I read her books, I will be left with a smile on my face and new characters to love :)",3,"[-1.3110105668075347, -1.4795825483302134, -0.7702351946169179, -1.0162339077581453, -1.2323504433206014]",-0.7702351946169179

1768,"Great book, fast read and I enjoyed every second! There was just the right amount of intrigue to keep you on the edge of your seat and I loved the fact that it was written from two POV's.

I love how the book started off in the present but then did a flashback. I enjoyed getting to know Jonathon when he was younger and watching him change his arrogant ways a bit - he was just as sexy as ever! He was so sweet and caring with Cassie. Cassie was extremely guarded but it was wonderful watching her barriers start to come down as their friendship grew. I loved Jonathan, he's was so much more than what people saw or gave him credit for and I'm glad Cassie truly saw him. The flashback ended rather abruptly for me and I was slightly confused. Thankfully a lot of those questions got answered in the second half of the book.

I enjoyed the present day part of the story, there was a lot of intensity and animosity! We learned a lot about Cassie and I felt so bad for what had become of her life. I do wish there would have been more Jonathon. He was so bitter and sweet all wrapped into one... I found myself wanting more. What can I say, he's a Ferro and I can never get enough!

I loved all the different characters and how they were are interlaced from the other books. I totally enjoyed Sean and Peter and getting to see more interaction between the brothers. Some other characters from H. M. Ward's books also make appearances and I think everything is tied together well.

I really liked the ending and thought this was a wonderful love story. I was left with a lot of unanswered questions but there will be a Stripped 2 so I'm confident they'll be answered. I felt there was some closure at the end of this book but there's still a cliffhanger which creates the foundation for the next book.

Excellent story, I was hooked!

He also has an amazing gift of weaving tales that pull you in with intrigue and great imagination.  There is always a bigger message under the actual storyline with John Irving.  Two best examples of how he can create a unique modern day literary epic are THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP and THE CIDER HOUSE RULES.  He has had a couple of slight misses over the past years but here he returns with a literary piece that is truly John Irving at his finest.  I am not going to waste time on the plot or the hidden symbolism in this book as many already have.  I don't want to spoil it for the reader.  You can decide all that for yourself.  That is the purpose and the joy of a John Irving book.

He is a strong alpha but has no desire to settle in one place that is until he meets Margery. Rex is visiting his friend Grant, the alpha of the Kincaid pack, when he meets Margery, and he is instantly drawn to her.

And his days as an ER Doctor can be long. Yes, he absolutely is the ""full package"" but so is Josie. Josie is a fantastic heroine!  She is sweet,sassy, sexy and funny! She is also a very talented and creative baker.
I am a huge fan of rom-coms and also of best friends to lovers, especially the concept of best friends who don't even realize that they are perfect for each other and then they fall hopelessly in love. It is just fills me with happiness!! This was one-step better because when Josie needs a new roommate, because they are such great friends, Chase & Josie agree to be roommates and find out that they perfect together in every way. They take it one step further and give in to their crazy attraction for each other, but decide it will be a short term thing once they get it out of their systems so they can remain friends. But at one point it gets too real because Chase is already in love with her and doesn't think he can live with her and end their physical relationship.
They are 100% compatible and so many of their conversations totally had me laughing out loud. Their chemistry and passion is super hot so their sexy times are like a volcano erupting!
They are just amazing together! These two characters are just so incredibly likable!
I loved the recipes Josie creates and how she always has Chase taste test for her. It is so sweet how she incorporates her feelings for Chase into her recipes.
My favorite line of the book, although there were so many, is when Chase says to Josie, "" I'm crazy about you. I wan't Swedish Fish with you all the time.""

8871,"""You are supposed to be my perfect ending, but I'm just your beginning""

Tattooed Scars is the much anticipated sequel to Tattooed Emotions by Alicia Rae. We were left with that delicious ending that had most readers panting for more of Raelyn and Damien.

My heart broke for Raelyn, just as when she just found her great love and she was finally living her life to the fullest  she receives the most tragic news. She was torn between her options. If she were single, she knew what shed choose, but she has Damien now. And Im just so glad hes there for her when she needed him most.

I think I fell in love even more with Damien. I love how he took care of Raelyn and how he tries to fight for her, even when shes in the brink of giving up. You know its true love when he/she stays at the lowest point in your life and doesnt give up even if you push him/her away. Damien did just that, and because of it  he has my heart.

This time, we are gifted with Damiens POV, even if its just for a few chapters. We get to see what is inside his head. His thoughts, his worries and it were enough for us to know how much he values Raelyn.

Just like the first one, the steam wasn't lacking, it got even hotter and sexier. The love was just overflowing as much as the heartache. Nevertheless, this novel gives a lot of hope that anything and everything is possible, especially when you don't give up.

Im looking forward for the next book in the series, perhaps its the happy ending the two of them very much deserved.

1500,"I'm a sucker for reunited lovers, and I was especially looking forward to seeing Aiden get his HEA. In the previous books you could really feel how much he was hurting by the way he lashed out at anyone who took their potential mate for granted and tried to fight it. The poor man had everything and lost it, so my heart really went out to him. Let me just tell you, the raw emotion and shock when he felt her again? Staggering. And then once they were past that shock, lordy, lordy was the tension between these two hot! With her not remembering him mentally, but still felt the inexplicable physical draw, let me just say it made things rather interesting, and I loved every second of it. I especially enjoyed the way things were drawn out rather than rushed into. Typically I'm always in a hurry for the couple to get together, but this time around it was handled so well that I enjoyed savoring it. Bravo!

Yet again one of the best things about these series is the focus not only on the main couple but the side couples as well. I really love how closely all of the books are tied together, and it makes it easy to jump right in after the long break between books. I read a large number of books a year, so it's always a huge bonus for me when things are set up like this series where I don't have to go back and try to recap so I'm not lost. So from an avid and voracious reader, I thank you Ms. Reus very much for this.

HUNTER REBORN is yet another installment in the fabulous Moon Shifter series that I thoroughly enjoyed. It's sure to please fans of the series, and there's enough backstory for new readers to jump in, but I guarantee they'll want to go back and start from the beginning after reading this one.

Jennifer hit this one out of the park! Into the net? Insert-awesome-sports-metaphor-here.

Olivia and Ben met almost as soon as the book began, and I love when that happens. Their, shall we say, unique platonic relationship was certainly put to the test under the strains of their attraction, and Jennifer wrote this just beautifully. I was eagerly turning the pages to see how these two would finally get together!

What I love the most about Jennifer's books, this one absolutely included, is she really writes smart characters. I could actually envision Olivia doing the things she did and Ben saying things he did. Olivia's own unique personal ""quest"" was one that I've never read in a romance novel before, and again, I was GLUED to the pages to see where that went as well.

If you like a smart, emotional, pulls-you-in-and-won't-let-go-until-the-last-page contemporary romance, THIS IS YOUR BOOK!!! It's another reminder of why Jennifer is, hands-down, one of my all-time favorite authors!

I am somewhat familiar with the story from the book of Chris Kyle and his tragic death at the hands of a fellow vet.  Bradley Cooper played the role masterfully in probably his best performance of his career.  I have always been a Clint Eastwood fan as an actor but his movies as a director have given me even greater respect for his talent behind the camera.  This movie does an admirable job at showing the tough job that our military men go through day in and day out at protecting everything this country was founded on.  The story is well done; it is heartfelt, emotional and feels real with its action and scenery.  This is a movie that I will watch again and again.

Thanks for your service, Legend, and thanks to all your brothers in arms.

7342,"Bonded is not my first Autumn Sand book but it is the first I have read in her Twisted Hearts Love Story. I was able to jump right in and read this as a standalone but I will be going back to read the previous two books. Bonded is told in dual points of view and is quick paced. It will keep your undivided attention from chapter one and you will not be able to put it down until the very last page. It is sexy and thrilling. There are a few topics that might trigger certain emotions but it's nothing too graphic just implying.

We begin with Brenda who is running from a life she never wanted. Fast forward and we find her fulfilling her lifelong dream of helping to heal people. She is a pediatric cancer nurse and is compassionate and caring towards her young patients. She's independent and knows her job takes a lot of her time so long lasting relationships are not something she's after. She met Magnum through mutual friends and thought maybe they could be friends with benefits. But he blew her off and never returned her calls. No love lost to her but also no second chances for him.

Magnum has a gut-wrenching story. His childhood was robbed from him because his father only knew one way to love his son. Now Magnum lives with the memories that become nightmares when he sleeps. He has made a life for himself and that includes women at his beck and call. His taste in bedroom fantasies is not for everyone and therefore he keeps women at arm's length.

Magnum shows a side of himself to Brenda that should make her run but she is determined to fight next to him and with him just as he is doing for her.

These two will face danger and near death experiences but together they will fight for each other.

Bonded has its tender moments and Magnum's words are poetry. This book is suspenseful and keeps you on the edge of your seat.

4256,"HARD FALL by C.J. Lyons is an exciting Romantic Suspense. # 5 in the ""Lucy Guardino FBI Thrillers"" series, but can be read as a stand alone. Although, I would recommend reading the others in this amazing series, especially ""After Shock"",which ""Hard Fall"" continues the story.
Faced paced,action packed thriller. This is a high-stake adventure, with dire consequences. Romantic suspense at it's best!

Once again, Ms. Lyons delves into the human soul. This tale is not for the faint of heart, for this is a tale of dark human emotions, violence with realistic consequences,and very adult situations.

I love the way Ms. Lyons brings her characters to life on every page and beyond, her emotional tales are awe-inspiring. Ms. Lyons writes tales that not only holds you to the pages, but kicks you emotions into high gear. High-octane, heart pumping tale of sacrifice, romance and love. A must read for anyone who enjoys high-octane emotions with realistic characters and an intriguing storyline.

What is in Lucy's future? I see more coming soon. This is not the end to Lucy Guardino. An awesome read from beginning to the very last page. A must read!

I don't think I've read anything by Shalvis before but this certainly won't be the last! I really loved this story. Callie and Tanner are so much fun together. I love high school crushes that bloom later in life. It's great to see how they interact and how flustered Callie gets around him. This book had a little bit of everything you want in  a romance story. I really can't wait to get more books by Shalvis! She's definitely great at what she does. I highly recommend this book (and I'm guessing her others) if you like romance stories. Plus, Callie's grandmother is really funny (:

There are so many questions, so much tension and pain rolling around in Triple Play but once again SJ brings it all together and leaves me wanting more.

A couple of thoughts...

Who knew Bryce was such a bad a$$? Drew's mom and dad are awesome. I have a serious crush on Eric.

The way they are when they are together is amazing, each stayed unique yet improved and were able to lean on each other.  The character development was there, maybe more for Drew than the other two men, but still added much to their story. They found and embraced their own sense of normal. Again family played a big part in their story, both made and true.

With 7 theme parks in 6 continents opening at the same time, things seem to be going smoothly for Konrad, but monsters and theme parks don't mix!!

I thoroughly enjoyed this book!! It's fast paced, entertaining and a fun read. The author does an amazing job of getting us to connect with the character, even the monsters!! There is plenty of POVs in this and I loved getting to know the monsters more. It was fascinating to see the ""zoo"" from their point of view. Konrad pitches the Theme Park to the monsters as a safe haven from humans and from being hunted. But in reality they are being held captive and they know it!!

Wyatt and is friends were awesome too. They are such monster geeks and love arguing over which is best! This Theme Park is their dream come true and I adored seeing them in it. Could you imagine being able to walk through Vampire Village, or Ride down Werewolf River, or even walk through the Zombies?? Heaven for the boys.

In all, this was a really fun book. I wanted to read it because it reminds me of Jurassic Park, which is one of my absolute favourite movies!!!

It's hotter, sexier, sweeter, and more mature - indeed love is sweeter the second time around. This is much is true with Maddy and Reid. They had found love that is rare and true, but the past keeps on haunting them and an unexpected surprise awaits in their future.

The story picked up right after Let Love In ended. Maddy is pregnant and Reid had just walked out on her. Fears set in. She was young, alone and boyfriend-less. Reid on the other hand was shocked to hear the news. Although I didn't really pegged him for the type to run away - I guess it was expected when a bomb suddenly exploded in front of you without a warning. He just needed to regroup and settle himself. When he finally did - he was still a wonderful boyfriend who is ready to prove to Maddy that he can be a wonderful dad too.

They have a lot of issues to settle - most of which comes from Reid's past. We get to know him and his family in depth. Reid didn't care for his family anymore - but in order to get back to Maddy's graces, he needed to make peace with his mother. He just didn't expect what he found once he saw her. Things change, so does people.

The secondary characters are still awesome. Yes, Melanie is still in the story, and she has her own personal problems as well, but it didn't stop her to be the friend that Maddy needed. I'd love to read her story on the next book!! We get to know Katie too! And believe me if I say that you will unexpectedly love her once you get to know her.

If I enjoyed reading Let Love In, I fell in love with the same old characters in Let Love Stay. They had endured so much in life, and they face a brand new challenge. It wasn't a piece of cake - they had to work hard for them to be together. I love the changes in their character, they have come a long way since the first book. They still have problems and differences - but this time they face it head on, together, more honest with each other, more in love and at peace with themselves.

Let Love Stay is more than just a love story with a hot romance, and great sex - this is also a touching story about family, and forgiveness.

756,"I was excited to read The Loyal Heart, and while I don't really feel like the novel lived up to my excitement, overall, I still liked it and enjoyed the read.

My favorite thing about the novel is the brotherhood between former Confederate soldiers, which the series itself is build on, which is a plus. Robert Truax and his friends and fellow soldiers were captured in course of the Civil War and made a pact to always be there for one another, even after the war is over. The details of their time spent as prisoners of war is saddening and compelling, setting the groundwork for the friendship that would carry them through imprisonment and beyond.

I also loved the aspect of chivalry that is present throughout the novel. It's refreshing to have a male lead that's a bit rough around the edges but still determined to do the right thing. I also love the other men, Devin Monroe and Ethan Kelly. I was hoping that Ethan's story was next, but alas, it's one of the men that are not featured in this book, Thomas Baker. I do hope we'll see both of them again in future books.

Miranda Markham was not a main character that I connected with strongly, and that lack of emotion did color how I read the story. I actually preferred Belle, her maid, ha! I did appreciate that Miranda dealt with bouts of melancholy, but I didn't care for the way that people tiptoed around her when it was unnecessary to do so. The plot is a bit meandering as well, with mystery being focused on too late into the story. I thought the mysterious letters would be a big part of the story, but once all is found out, it kind of fizzles out rather quickly. I did like how once the men decided to act, they were very decisive with their actions and words.

Here in Bayside Desires we get to look at the first of this new series branch of the Love In Bloom series. In this first installment, we get to know Rick Savage and Desiree Cleary. Rick has come to the cape to get away from it all and yet not get away. Desiree was not prepared for what she found when she arrives just next door to her broody, pushy neighbor, Rick and Desiree together makes for the perfect distraction for them both from what they world has been reduced to.

These two have had their share of life being thrown their way. With painful past ranging from abandonment, loss, isolation, confusion, and heavy hearts and souls. They slowly bond with each other over their summer get away from their everyday life. I found the romance to be sweet and flirty with a slight edge towards the sensual and a very satisfying addition to the Love in Bloom world series.

I love that I got in on the very beginning of this new branch of the Love In Bloom series.

She fled 10 years ago after Nicks funeral, who was her high school boyfriend.  2.  Sophie is Nicks little sister.  3.  Jason Sloan is the best man.  4.  He and Katie have not spoken since she fled during the night and they use to be best friends.
  Now she lives in CA and is on the fast track to being a partner in a prestigious law firm.  She buries herself in work living her life in law, order, and being in control.  Has Katie truly moved on or does she need to face the truth she ran from?  Why cant she talk to Jason?  Will they both be able to talk through what happened 10 years ago?
  Jason has only wanted Katie in his life but both had great chemistry towards each other.  The flashbacks give you a better perspective of how their love grew but misunderstandings kept them apart.  Maybe she didn't lose her first love and her first love has been waiting for her all this time.  Wouldnt that be every womans dream to have a person love you that much!!!

This story follows Cole and Emma after they meet again for the first time in over a decade. However, we also get a taste of what these characters were feeling and experiencing all those years ago with flashbacks from the past.

Emma is one of those girls that seems unsure of herself. That is mainly due to having an attractive and popular cheerleader sister. She begins as an awkward preteen looking to find herself and evolves into a talented young woman. She is content and doesn't have the need for a man in her life.....

Cole...sigh...Oh, sorry!! Cole is one of those boys that you look at from afar because you know that you could never be good enough to claim him. He begins as the hot, popular football player that can have any girl he wants. He works hard at everything he does and becomes an attorney with little time on his hands to truly enjoy life.

Now, I know I said this was a sweet romance and it is. However, just when you are thinking ""What a nice, sweet, G rated book this is"".....BAM!! The author turns up the heat. Holy Heck! This isn't raunchy, but man is it hot!

5172,I really liked this story about Chris and Ash. It was about Ash getting a second chance at a happy fulfilled life and Chris getting what he always wanted someone to love. Ash and Chris met when Ash tried to jump from a window and gets badly injured. Chris is a fire fighter and goes to help but when he looks at Ash something in him lights up. Chris finds himself wanting to get to know Ash and Ash needs someone to take care of him after the accident. Chris moves Ash in with him and they become friends and more. They have a couple of ups and down but it was a sweet story how their love grew from a bad moment in Ash's life. Ash learns some people can be trusted. Chris and his friends make Ash feel alive again and he gets his life back on track. The ending was the cutest and I really liked the HEA.

2204,"What a delightful second book for Susan May Warrens Montana Rescue series. As Rescue Me delivers its action-packed romance, it swept me wholeheartedly into the drama, and I couldn't (or at least, didn't want to) stop reading. From the start, I enjoyed both Sam and Willow as main characters, both having many qualities to admire amidst evident flaws, and I cheered them through all the (heart-racing) adventure and dangerphysical, emotional, spiritual. These characters kept me on the edge of my seat, and I absolutely loved it. (Especially since Glacier National Park holds a very special place in my heart. An excellent setting.)

Rescue Me has perfectly reminded me of the reasons the Montana Rescue series belongs on my must-read list, and now, of course, I cant wait to pick up the next book, A Matter of Trust, in July. In the meantime, I highly recommend Rescue Mea perfect choice for readers of romance, adventure, and suspense, its a fast-paced and entertaining read!

There chemistry was off the charts. I love how Ryan could be rough with her, but so gentle the next minute. They were definitely meant to be together. The scenes in this book are SCORCHING HOT. Ryan is a total Alpha all the time, but in the bedroom he was totally dominant. I love that about him. He was a man on a mission and knew exactly what he wanted in life and business.

Kiss Me That Way by Lauren Trentham, book one in the authors new Cottonbloom series for St. Martins Press, is an incredibly engaging, well-written read. The characters, Monroe and Kirby, immediately grabbed my attention and pulled me into their story, and continued to keep me entertained throughout the book with their chemistry and almost soul-to-soul connection.

Cade Fournette and Monroe Kirby grew up on opposite sides of a town that straddles two states and they experienced vastly different home lives. Until one late September night when their lives intersected in an unexpected way. Now as two adults, their lives are intersecting again, and all the things that separated them in the past aren't quite as immense now.

A wonderful second chance at love story that tugged at my heartstrings more than once, Kiss Me That Way is a charming and touching start to what promises to be a fantastic new contemporary romance series. If you haven't read Lauren Trentham before, now is the time to startand Kiss Me That Way is the perfect book to start with.

She is in love, but is certain Church, the man she's been smitten with for quite some time, doesn't feel the same way about her. That's why his request to visit his family with him comes as such a surprise. Dixie takes whatever he's able to give her and says yes to the trip.

Church has been damaged by all the losses he's suffered in his past and isn't capable of letting anyone in. He's never even let a woman come close, but that changes when he needs to go back home together with a woman. He's admired Dixie from afar ever since he first met her, but he thinks he isn't boyfriend material and won't be good for her. That's why he's trying to be careful with her heart, but is that really the safest and least hurtful option for both of them?

Riveted is an amazing emotional story. Dixie is all smiles. Everyone around her sees her as their ray of sunshine. She has a beautiful loving personality, but like everyone else she needs someone who cares about her from time to time as well. She's perfect for Church. The darkness he has inside him makes it difficult for him to find the good things in life. He's been through a lot and is still grieving. My heart often ached for him and for the little boy he once was. He's protective and kind, but he doesn't let himself get close to the people he loves. That was sad to read about, but being with Dixie slowly changes him and that was beautiful to see. They have more than just chemistry, their connection is intense and special.

The two main characters are Dante who is the Phoenix packs Beta and extremely loyal to his entire pack as well a  to his alpha best friend Trey. He was there for his alpha in book one and now we get his story. Like the other wolves in this pack they all left home and followed their alpha while in their teens. They as a group had to make a place in the world for themselves. As a young man/wolf Dante 'imprinted' with Laura believing she was his mate. She broke that bond by cheating on him and choosing his older brother. It took its toll on him and made him close himself off to feelings. He is an excellent Beta but rarely takes any down time. After the end of the first book several members of their initial pack asked to join them. Gabe and his older sister Jaime joined their pack. Jamie spent her early years with all of the males in this pack until Trey and his followers were banished. Jamie and Gabe' s parents were violently killed and it has seriously affected Jaime' s wolf to the point that she's terrified to let her out. Jaime has always been drawn to Dante and he looked out for her when they were young. Many bad things go wrong for Jaime in particular in this book. Someone has targeted her. Sadly Jaime' s wolf is terrified and unstable and at times it looks very bad for her. It's a great book to read but I'm glad I read Feral Sins (book 1) first. It lines up who is in charge, who stirs up trouble and helps to see which wolves are dominant and which are submissive. I like the way the author describes the people, places and the wolves. The book draws you in at the very beginning and with the intrigue, suspense and romance it keeps you coming back for more. The book holds your attention and next thing you know you've read the book almost all night with hardly any breaks. This is the type of book I really enjoy and I look forward to meeting more pack members and reading more books by Ms Wright.",2,"[-0.8451983924626627, -2.2896156275125255, -1.0010876395357076, -1.0271980951039912, -1.1559088788364347]",-0.8451983924626627

Cade and Rebecca had a lust at first sight thing going that they both fought at first, but when they find themselves out celebrating in the same bar and the Fireball shots begin to flow... all rules about getting busy with coworkers go out the window.  These two are Hot. Hot. HOT together! I loved Rebecca's spunk and determination, and Cade's totally swoon-worthy, but I also loved Rebecca's roommate Chas and Cade's brother Trent. The ensemble just work so well together to make this a great read! Oh, and special mention to Petal Boo Bishop!! 4.5 stars

3377,"Excellent characters. Awesome story. Great build. Lots of humor. Great mix of emotion. A nice amount of hotness. A little drama. This story checked every box that I could hope for in an fantastic read. :-)

I absolutely adored Heather and Josh. I loved Heather, so sweet and determined. She was just so feisty and I loved her attitude and awesome comebacks. Josh was so great too. Guarded but so sexy and playful. Their first meeting was priceless! Right from the start I was so pulled in and was just excited to read their story. They're animosity is fan-freaking-tastic. Flirty, funny, and challenging. I loved Josh and Heathers building chemistry. I loved it all! It's a true romance building from friendship. Every single thing just had me smiling and rooting for them. I love that the author pulled me in, making me feel everything they were going through. There is such a vulnerability to Josh and Heathers characters that made them so real and endearing.

While there are lots of entertaining parts throughout, this story is also laced with emotion and it really pulled on my heart strings. I loved Josh and got him and where he was coming from but just wanted to shake him and give him a hug all at once because he was being all manly-noble at times. I liked the hints throughout the story about his past and how everything development.

There are so many little details to this story that come together that make it perfection. I loved Josh's mom. The relationship the Belles have. How we got more of Logan, making me excited for his and Alexiss story next. I loved Heather's back story and her determination to make it on her own. I loved the story of her working on a wedding and how that worked into her relationship with josh. Every thing together just made for this excellent build so by the end I was laughing, crying, and smiling! It was just wonderful.

Loved the writing. So many details pulling me in. Really likable and interesting characters. Excellent pace and build. I was just so entertained while reading. Seriously excellent read! I absolutely loved every single second of this. Heather and Josh's story was really perfect to me. 5 stars all the way!

Theres just enough naughtiness, heartache, and love to pull you in. Those love scenes are scorchin!! Gavin and Kat just seem so perfect for each other. You definitely go on a roller coaster ride for this duo.

Born to a prostitute druggie, Kat has never had an easy life, but she is resilient and tough as nails. Kat is a survivor. Gavin never intended to be the man to pick the shattered pieces of Kats heart and put them back together again. Both riddled with a complicated past, Kat and Gavin find comfort in each other. I don't have any problem with the student/teacher storyline. To me, reading is a fantasy. I go beyond my comfort zone and will explore just about any book. This book made me laugh and smile but you also felt the pain oh the pain!! I wanted to scoop Kat up myself and protect her and just give her hugs.

This was a fantastic first read of Laura Lees for me! From what Ive read, this may be her
darkest book thus far but I might have to look into the other ones. Lee just has a great way of writing and telling her stories. I think most people will enjoy this book even if they don't do the student/teacher storyline. This is so much more than just that!

Who has been waiting for Jax and Ellie to take the spotlight? Ever since that excerpt was released at the end of Until July, I have been craving this duos story. Jax has the mouth-watering potential to steal Ellies cautious heart but will she even give him the chance to prove they belong to one another?

The prologue of Until Jax launches the dramatic storyline that only gets more intriguing with each passing page. The idea that Ellie and Jax are practically strangers yet inexplicably draw to each other snagged my attention right away. He appears more invested in their future since he experienced the boom upon first meeting her but Ellie isn't immune to the heated chemistry. Her personality is naturally more guarded and hesitant, which makes perfect sense considering her upbringing. Ellie just takes a little longer to warm up and luckily Jax is a very patient man.

The variety of events that occur throughout this book kept me on the edge of my seat. There is underlying danger, threatening secrets, and explosive suspense beautifully mixed with passionate devotion, flirtatious dialogue, and seductive scenes. The inclusion of previous characters is always welcome and executed in this series extremely well. I love the family feel of these novels!

Determined to put her past behind her, Cassidy Peyton moves to the Big Apple. But New York has a few dark secrets of its own, including Serve, an exclusive BDSM club. It's a place she isn't sure she's ready for, until she sees him watching her. Hot. Intent. Knowing. With eyes that leave her stomach tied in knots, because the loneliness he's trying to hide matches her own.

Security expert David Cavill has more secrets than any man should. Secrets that forever shut down any possibility of love, marriage, or family. Yet Cassidy draws him in, an intoxicating combination of strength, candor, and sensuality that David can't resist. But as their bond deepens, Cassidy must decide if she can love a man whose heart is bound tighter than the form of bondage he craves...

Review:

Though it does not list it on the Goodreads site, this is part of the Serve multi-author series.  This is a total stand alone and do not need to read any of the others, though I have read quite a few of them and have enjoyed them all.  This is a new to me Author and I really liked her writing style and the story and characters in this book.  I am not sure how many pages there were in the story, but it flew by, I finished it my lunch hour.  The author did a great job of combining sexy and emotion in this story.  I particularly liked that David is into shibari and thought that tied (no pun intended) the characters together in the beginning and ending of the story.  Both characters know this is affair is on a time limit, but you know those emotions don't know anything about time limits.  David is hiding a secret about his family that he is afraid to tell Cassidy about because of his past relationships and Cassidy has to show David that she is not like the others.  When David gives up, I like that Cassidy goes and gives him a ""Come to Jesus"" talk and fights for him and shows that she is different from the rest.  Though, he is stubborn and it takes some manipulation to get David with the program, but the ending is very satisfying.

Great for when you want some quick spice in your day.

All my favorites are in this one plus John Smith, an FBI agent soon to be retired who asks for help from the Monkeewrench gang to help solve some murders that are being posted on the internet.  Some of them with clues as to where the next murder will take place.  He can't officially approve of their methods but is more than eager for any information they come up with.

Gino Rolseth and Leo Magozzi are back with their unique partnership.  Gino happily married and always looking for his next meal and Leo living his lonely single life and wondering how long it will take Grace (of the Monkeewrench Gang) to fully trust again.

The Monkeewrench's - Grace, Annie, Harley and Roadrunner - are doing their best, using methods suspect at best to help solve these crimes and doing it under the watchful (and suspicious) eye of John Smith.

This series has everything - intriguing mysteries, characters you really get involved with, a little romance and humor.  I particularly enjoy the Wisconsin references.

I know I feel like I'm right in the middle of the story laughing with my friends every time and GETTING OVER IT was no exception. I have wanted to know more about Hailey Conner since book one and the elusive Tyler Bennett, the only Bennett brother not to stay in Sapphire Falls. Turns out the two most mysterious people from Sapphire Falls have been having a secret affair for years.  But Ty's ready for the secret to come out... he just doesn't realize all the secrets he'll be bringing when he does.

I loved Ty and Hailey together! They were perfect for each other, both having some very specific needs the other was more than ready to fulfill.  Hailey desperately needed to be adored and put on a pedestal; Ty could only be satisfied with the very best, the ""Gold"" in everything he did. It worked out well that Ty realized at fifteen Hailey was the best, his dream girl, and she became a challenge he never gave up on even when he left Sapphire Falls behind. They had some tough issues to work through as a couple, but as usual Ms. Nicholas tells their story with plenty of help from their friends and family in Sapphire Falls. As a matter of fact my favorite scene was when Ty approaches Travis for a ""private"" advice on women... and the whole family joins in.  It was so easy to picture in my head. Of course, there was also plenty of steamy private time for Hailey and Ty which was balanced out by witty dialogue, a wonderful storyline and characters it's impossible not to love. 4.5 stars

Cassie has just been told who her father is and decides to meet him. Little does she know exactly how this will change her life in more ways then one. It wasn't easy trying to fit into her new family dynamics while her step-mother is trying to keep her away from her new sisters. Thankfully, she had Trey there to help her. Even if neither one of them were aware how interconnected their lives really were.

Trey and Cassie made a great pair and I liked that they both had something to lose if their relationship became public knowledge. Those two together were pretty hot and achingly sweet. Looking forward to reading more about these people.

The story revolves around Jane Steel who in many ways is fashioned after Jane Eyre. The story is profoundly interesting, great fun, and intriguing.

I still feel more of a connection between her and Adam though and am looking forward to how this storyline will unveil itself in the coming books...finally, I enjoy the strength, determination, independence, and loyalty that encompasses Mercy's personality...she does what she feels is right but not without thought as to the potential consequences not only to herself but those she loves...great addition to the series and am looking forward to the next one:)",0,"[-0.9058750855848117, -1.2336775984348187, -0.8750281736889406, -1.0249634535564465, -1.4810937771262798]",-0.8750281736889406

Poor Cash has been in love with Callie since his best friend Beau dated her in college and then married her. Now divorced from Beau, Cash is still there for Callie but he still works with Beau so his feelings tear him up. He tries so hard to just be friends with Callie but his heart gets in the way and he just gets in deeper. Yep thats right, hes screwed. There is no way he can keep from going down the rabbit hole with Callie. He's so sweet, amazing and lovable and is there for Callie always; hes the perfect man. Callie is so lovable, sweet and amazing too. See, they really are perfect for each other, but can they overcome the roadblocks life sets in their way?
One such roadblock has a name, and its Beau and things could get ugly.",3,"[-2.373649725902957, -1.1469154649676647, -0.8787450350623411, -1.0202551072171113, -1.6730443671233584]",-0.8787450350623411

He'd recognize her voice till the day he died. His brain had already found a safe place for its keeping.

...building a life is about taking the pieces that matter and figuring out how to fit them together.

You should know that want and should are having an epic battle in my head right now.

I'm going to fall for you Duchess. Hard. Don't know if it's just for now or forever, but if it's not okay with you, tell me now.

What if each thing I want is a puzzle piece, but they belong to different puzzles, and I can't figure out how to fit them all together.

My Review:

Katy Regnery writes amusing, sweet, and sexy stories with adorable, enigmatic, and endearing characters, even though I am highly envious and should despise them as they are filthy rich, remarkably attractive, and highly successful. I first fell in love with Ms. Regnery's English Brothers then switched up to the Winslows, and am now enjoying the Rousseau clan. I am ever so glad Blueberry Lane is a large neighborhood.",4,"[-0.999560557335299, -1.4175315933135728, -0.880380674681061, -1.0225575491214183, -0.9908275645865089]",-0.880380674681061
6721,"Logan Mitchell and Tate Morrison... their first book Try was my very first M/M read and six books later they continue to be one of my favorite book couples of all time. I was so glad when Ella Frank decided to return to their world and give us a whole new trilogy.

Try. Take. Trust. Tease. Tate and Logan have been through so much.

But it is still bittersweet that this is the last book featuring them as the main couple, but it was everything I needed it to be. This is the story of two very different men finally getting to the same place at the same time. Their connection and love has only grown stronger throughout the trials they have faced. This is the realization that there are indeed soul mates that will challenge everything, be a catalyst for change, and provide more rewards than could be imagined.

This one is full of mostly good stuff. There are so many plans from the holidays to the wedding. They are shifting priorities and celebrating love, family, friends, and developing a new sense of home and happiness. They are getting closure on some things and dealing with issues that have plagued them from the past.

These two just make the other's world better. They have grown and changed so much over the course of this series. I absolutely adore Tate and Logan individually and separately. Logan, the more controlled, cocky, serious one, and Tate, the easygoing, lovable one that is not a pushover and can be alpha too. They balance each other and have such great chemistry and a fun dynamic. I love getting both of their points of view. They feel like real people to me.

This installment is sweet, hot, sexy, funny, romantic, swoony, and tear inducing. It felt like visiting old friends from the first page and I was captivated and felt like I experienced it all with them. It is truly a celebration of a wonderful couple who have battled the odds, dealt with their own demons, and come out on the other side.

I enjoyed more time with their friends and family. And I am looking forward to a spin-off featuring side characters. So I hope that we will be seeing more of Logan and Tate in the future, and that we do not really have to say goodbye to them completely.",3,"[-1.7291698050698825, -2.214859970853401, -1.1671734574939008, -1.0059092517325483, -0.8803855023713862]",-0.8803855023713862

6126,"I love collaborations between Penny Reid and L.H. Cosway! The writing is smart, witty, and unique, and The Cad and the Co-Ed is another great addition to this series of standalones.

Readers will adore Bryan, well the reformed Bryan.  The old one is everything the synopsis says he is.  The new Bryan though is more controlled, more aware of his weaknesses, and he actively steers clear of these traps that would hurt him.  What he isn't prepared for is his biggest weakness, Eilish and her son Patrick, but they become a different weakness for him.  They become something to motivate him and to keep him on the straight and narrow.  Bryan really earns reader allegiance when her secret is revealed, and readers get to see how accepting he is and how much loves, resulting in readers wanting him to get that HEA with the two of them.

Eilish will earn readers' undying respect.  What she has dealt with in regards to her family and her age when getting pregnant makes her an amazing woman, even at such a young age.  She is strong, sometimes stubborn, and her capacity to love and even forgive is wonderful.

The story chronicles their journey back together and forming a new family. I love the pacing and progression of their relationship.  What I truly love about the book is that Penny Reid and L.H. Cosway present an accurate and reasonable reaction to the Eilish's secret being revealed.  The care they take with integrating Bryan, the connection between Patrick and Bryan, and Eilish and Bryan's progression as a couple is all very real. The insecurities felt by the couple are believable, leading to a conflict that is also true to the development of the story.  Finally, the resolution of the story, particularly that epilogue will just warm readers' hearts.

Penny Reid and L.H. Cosway have, yet again, delivered another excellent romance, that will make readers laugh and swoon as they see another rugby player fall in love.

5787,"This is my first book by this author and I enjoy her style of storytelling immensely. This story takes place during WWII in the United Kingdom, both England and Wales. It is the story of two sisters that join many children in the countryside, outside of the bigger cities where the Germans are bombing. Thirteen year old Nell and her younger sister Olive are sent away by their mother who has just had a baby and is also hoping to hear from their father who is off at war, so she has decided to stay in London, hoping to hear from her husband, her other son who was supposed to have evacuated with the sisters, jumped of the train at the last moment, to help his Mom.
The sisters end up in a quaint little town in Wales, and end up loving it there, assigned to a great couple that takes them in, and treat them like family, they meet some special friends, and know most people in the town. All changes when that couple is reassigned to a different area and the girls end up on a long journey to get back home. The people they meet and the experiences they have, make you just want to keep reading. This was a wonderful story, and a journey worth taking.

Can he help her win the fight of her life? Their bond is growing strong, add in his crazy funny family, an over dramatic best friend and you have a recipe for success

Tessa and Sean are my new favourite couple. He's preparing to rob a bank and she's a teller there. The best thing? He's about to seduce her as part of the criminal plan. Oh, I thoroughly loved this plot! Riley's stories keep getting better both in writing and in ideas. Thief is a bit on the suspense/thriller genre with a seedy gang, some secrets and a hero with a hard life. I enjoyed how well developed the robbery is and all the plans around it. It gave the story a sharp edge.

Love and trust are important issues in this adventure. It was sweet and hot to watch Sean and Tessa's relationship start, then put to the test by betrayal and crime. The second part was romantic with a strong sense of possession, redemption and hope.

I absolutely fell in love with Thief as it's got all the elements I crave most from Riley's longer stories. Additionally, there are dialogues to sigh over and a ""throne"" anecdote that really resonated with me. Loved that! ;o)

Almost non-stop suspense  of the chilling stalker kind  A Perfect Secret is a little less passionate than the others but the romance is deeper emotionally.  In fact, the romance reminded me of Jane Austens Persuasion in many ways.  Perhaps my favorite thing about A Perfect Secret is the interaction between the brothers  they are each unequivocally themselves when they congregate together.  Cole is the leader but still a bit rapacious.  Jared is completely and delightfully rogueish. Grant is as brooding as ever. And Christian lets his true side show more in this book than any other, appropriately enough given that it IS his story.  Yet, for as different as they all are, they also have each others backs.

4.5 stars
M/F Romance - second chance
I was given this book for an honest review by Wicked Reads.

I have read all of the books in this series and I highly recommend reading them in order. However, if you choose not to, you won't necessarily be missing out on who everyone is.

Mia is a workaholic. She is head chef at her and her friend's successful, sexy restaurant. She wants things done to her specification and is constantly wanting perfection. She also has a lot of insecurities that we see throughout the book. Her past is somewhat of a mystery, but as Mia's life progresses, you get to catch glimpses of her past. I like how Proby wove the past and present together. When Camden comes back in to Mia's life, Mia has to decide whether or not to take a leap of faith and trust her heart. She has never forgotten Camden and even though they have complicated history, the chemistry is still very apparent.

Camden is a sexy head chef who has his own tv show. Now he's been asked to compete against Mia, his long ago love. Camden has never forgotten Mia - she was sexy, funny, a fabulous chef and their relationship was easy. Even though Camden was heartbroken in the past, he can't deny that they still have chemistry.

Camden and Mia fell back in love rather quickly. I liked how Camden was constantly reassuring Mia that she was enough and that she didn't need to change in order for Camden to like her. I did think that despite Mia's hangups, when it was brought to her attention and the attention of others, it never was truly addressed. She was never quite strong enough to stand up and say, ""stop saying that about me."" I wish that she had been more forward with those people in the story. It felt glossed over.

Overall, Mia and Camden's book was the perfect conclusion to this series. I will miss it greatly and loved all of the women in this series.

I loved every word in this book, especially the way the author strung them together into a deliciously sexy, sappy, sweet, well-developed novel. I'm not a fan of romance novels usually, but this was a combination of romance, chick lit, women's fiction etc. and it was hilarious and edgy. I adored both of the main characters, Faith and Levi, as well as the supporting ""cast"" of family and friends. I loved all the conflict and angst and well, I'm swooning over this book and about to download the next one in the series.

Ashlie does it again.  WOW.  Hot basketball players and equally hot females.  Book two in the Playing to Win series.  These books have so far been very entertaining.  First book follows Kyle and Callie as they meet and fall in love and challenge each other every step of the way.  Book two ( Playing for Love ) follows Callie and Kyles' best friends Cassie and Jamal as they are thrown together as maid of honor and best man at Callie and Kyle's wedding.
The attraction and chemestry are totally undeniable and almost irrestiable.  Throw into the mix Jamal's daughter Jaydence and Cassie is doomed.  Jamal is struggling to find ways to get Cassie to spend time with him and luckily his daughter has thoughtfully asked Cassie to come spend the day with them.  Cassie definately gets more than she bargins for including a black eye just before the wedding.
Event after event Cassie and Jamal are thrown together and find it hard to be apart.  Yet Cassie finds it hard to trust men after the things she saw and went through as a child.  Now she is still on the run. What will happen if HE finds her.  How will she get away? Can she trust Jamal to not abandon her if HE does come for her?  I am not going to go into depth here about these questions and delimias but I just have to say you MUST read this book and find the answers for yourself.
I am so looking forward to book three which I can only assume includes Aria and Trevin.
There is no actual sexual content in this book, hints of arousal yet no descriptions of actual actions.  Very well written.  I am loving Ashlie Knapp.",2,"[-0.913539117753972, -1.796994550986886, -1.0304716903146889, -1.0349056984378961, -1.1213309678213492]",-0.913539117753972

A Hypochondriacs Notebook by Amanda Johnson 

Ive been a fan of AM Johnsons stories since the beginning, she writes from her soul and the stories really resonates. Annas story is about self-doubt but when you find the right person that help you is like an anchor for your heart. Well written and a powerful message.

My Past, My Future, and All that Lies Between by Maria Macdonald 

Maria had the way to pull your emotions right away. Saras story was very hard because she feels that is her fault what happens to her sister, but she became strong enough to deal with it. Was a special and lovely story.

Breaking Point by Autumn Grey

Biggest fan of Autumn words, but not a big fan of m/m so this story was my first and she don't disappoint me at all.  She captured the feelings and the need for the love in this story. Fantastic characters and the connection was of the charts.

This anthology brings a bunch of great author for a great cause; definitely recommend it .

For Zara this is a lot of change and Zara struggles to adapt to this new dynamic in her life. There are many laugh out loud moments as well as poignant.

5545,"Where do you go when it's cold outside - when the winds of despair rage and the snow of uncertainty and doubt piles up? Susan May Warren paints a beautiful portrait of hope in the concept of the Storm House. Weaving warm and freezing imagery throughout the book, Warren slowly, gently creates a story full of the simple but astounding truth of God's love as especially celebrated at Christmastime.

Warren's books thrive on emotional intensity, and Baby, It's Cold Outside is further proof of her skill. Her characters are flawed and needy - just the kind of people who could use a Christmas miracle to shake their hearts out of a cold coma. From sweet little Arnie with his big imagination, to two couples in need of a second chance at love, all brought together by a blizzard, the stage is set for a comforting yet unique Christmas story. Add in a few tissues for those heartwarming gusts of emotion, and the package is complete!

If you're looking for a story full of love to get you into the holiday mood, this book is it! The song references along with the contrasting blizzard/cozy-home descriptions had me listening to Christmas music despite the fact that it's not even Halloween at the time I'm writing this - a testament to the fact that you should reserve some time to stay inside with this book this winter, when oh, Baby, It's Cold Outside!

5284,"Famous by Default by MK Harkins  4 stars

I always enjoy a story that has a subtle message about how to make our world a better place.  MK Harkins does that in Famous by Default.  We are reminded to eat healthy, live well, reduce our carbon footprint and most of all to be kind to one another.  Kindness sure does go a long way!

This is the story of Jax and Savin.  Jax is a kid whose brothers are in a famous band and he is doing everything to avoid the spotlight.  He just wants to live his own life and thats not easy to do because his identical twin brother is part of the band.  Savin is a girl who is about to age out of the foster care system and has had a really really tough experience in the homes shes been in.  Savin finally finds peace at Jaxs Aunt Bettys place.  My prayer for the world is that everyone has an Aunt Betty in their life.  Such kindness and wisdom.  No matter how bad the days, there are so many good that follow.

While working and living on Aunt Bettys farm, both Jax and Savin learn about themselves and begin to heal and have a better understanding of themselves as human beings.

I really enjoyed this book.  Its a young adult book that I think is appropriate for all ages.  It does have some profound sadness in it, and we learn that when you're able to push aside the fear and face your grief, all the other obstacles youve been wrestling with will surface.  The way this story is written is almost like a song.  A son that Jax could have written actually.  Its a lovely tale of love and loss and rebirth.

Everett is this man, from a broken past, that loves his BFF something fierce, but there is always something standing in his way of acting on his feelings... Insecurities and doubt are most of his issues.  Then you have Cameron who is this beautiful, stubborn and charming girl who loves and wishes for Everett to love her.

This book will cover the past and the present lives of Cameron and Everett. You will watch the missed opportunities these two had.  You will watch these two circle around each other and root for them to succeed.  Their story is not an easy story to read... it is emotionally draining.... but the pain, the misunderstandings, and the time lost will be all worth it when things finally come into place because that ending!!! SWOON!

The one thing I love about this book is that it hit pretty much every emotion I  had. I love the journey Cameron and Everett story took me on.

Being from Vancouver, I especially liked that this is where the story takes place. I loved going on a tour of the city with Marcus and Avery.
The chemistry between Marcus and Avery was great--the humor of it all had me giggling constantly. I enjoyed the development of the characters throughout the book. Being the first book, Michelle gave us a really good image of who Marcus, Avery and the rest of Brutal Strength truly are. I can't wait to see how they evolve in the second book.
Avery's secret made for some great interactions between band members, especially Marcus. I really enjoyed how Avery was able to bring the bright and the light out of Marcus-- which had been buried for so long.

3212,"New Hope is a great little place to run to when you are trying to fly below the radar of your controlling ex-fianc, At least it is for Elisa Hall. Ultimate Courage is the second book in Piper Drakes True Heroes series ( Extreme Honor being book one) and can be read as a standalone, but I wouldn't pass up reading either of them. These stories are suspenseful & informative and once again I found myself hooked by the end of the first chapter.

Ultimate Courage opens with our the introduction of Elisa Hall (on the run) to one Alex Rojas and his daughter Serene ""Boom"" Rojas in less than ideal circumstances. Elisa is left with a very good reason to visit Hopes Crossing Kennel's where Alex works. From there, the connection between Elisa and Alex is fortified by Elisa's secret and Alex's keen observations of her and need to protect.

In Elisa we find a smart young woman whose life has been overshadowed by her fianc. The mystery in this story is who he is and why she feels this way. As we learn about how he had taken control of her emotions, he becomes an ominously scary character. Alex immediately see's something in her, detects her fear and does what an alpha hero does best, steps in to protect her. This is where the story is fun. Their chemistry is fabulous and once again, Drake gives us characters who consider each others well being (safety and feelings) foremost. This connection builds rather quickly which works for these characters and the situation. Elisa is filled with self-doubt in how well she reads people, and Alex struggles with the fear that he'll experience a PTSD episode where he might end up hurting people. Again, Drake handles this with thoughtfulness.

Lastly, the secondary characters; Boom, Gary and Greg and of course Souza fill in the story line and do their part in connecting Elisa to this small community. Elisa's situation drives the story line which is well paced and Drake's descriptive writing lends an authentic feel to how things shake-out. 4 Stars and recommendation!",3,"[-0.9581920128045334, -1.994548705291514, -1.0306367321928036, -1.011780545567853, -1.4129075513622569]",-0.9581920128045334

For Baylor Moore it was the moment her mother abandoned her and her father, for Jayden Sinclair was the moment he found out his father was not who they all thought he was.

Baylor is  kind of awkward, she's afraid to give her heart to someone, but she's one hell of a fighter and an exceptional hockey player. She's been trying to prove herself all her life to people around her, not only because she's a woman in a man's world and her father is her trainer, but because he's also respected coach in the college circuit.

Jayden has been going through some hard personal times. His father left his mother to fend for herself, and although his older brother and NHL player, Jude, is helping, it's Jayden who's in the home front taking care of things.

Baylor and Jayden meet while on vacation in Florida but things didn't go too well for them, but when things are meant to be nothing will stop them. As luck will have it Baylor's dad is assigned as the new head coach for the Bellevue Bullies and that's when things start getting interesting and Baylor and Jayden reunite. They have the same goals in life, Jayden wants to prove he's as good as his older brother and he can get in the NHL through his own merits, for Baylor is to show the world that the hockey world is ready for a female to be playing with the big boys.

I absolutely LOVED this book, these two fantastic characters along bring this beautiful story to life and  keep the reader glued to their journies until the last word has been written. I loved how Toni made this a journey for both of these people, she built their relationship block by block and the result was a beautiful well crafted story full of struggles, love, and great accomplishments. And did I mention that Mrs Aleo is the queen of sexual tension? Yeah, she's pretty damn good at that and it's one of the things that keeps me coming back to her books.

This book is very well written and you can tell that she spent a lot of time in research. Be warned, though, the scenes where the husband and wife are falling in love with each other are a little intense. Nothing vulgar or across any lines, but enough to make me blush at times.

Priscilla White is a young single woman in New York. Her family wishes to marry her off but she is determined to remain single, especially since she is barren because of a childhood illness. Her hearts desire is to become a missionary to far away India, but it seems that God has other plans. Into her life appears Eli Ernest, a doctor who also wishes to remain single but is told that in order for him to be a missionary he must marry. Priscilla is told the same thing. A marriage of convenience is what they agree to and soon Priscilla is joining Eli on a trek across the frontier known to us as the Western USA.

Priscilla's story is based on a true one of the first woman to make the trip. Hardships meet them at every turn, but when God has a purpose for a life He will always see it come to fruition.

2203,"Valerie Fraser Luesse is not new to writing as she has been with Southern Living magazine for some time.  However, Missing Isaac is her first novel, and it is a wonderful story!

missing isaac

The story takes place in the 1960s and is very much during racial tensions of that period.  Pete is a young boy who has to deal with the loss his father after a tragic accident in the cotton field.  However, his dear friend Isaac helps him navigate the loss.  Isaac and Petes father worked together, but were also the dearest of friends.

When Isaac disappears without a trace, Pete determines to find him and solve the mystery.  While searching, he encounters a young girl, Dovey, who lives in the woods with her extended family, almost hiding from the real world.

I really loved this story, and did not want to put it down.  The love that Pete shares with the people in his community sees no color, simply people.  He goes out of his way to love those that so many in his community avoid, and he grows into a man that chooses to always do the right thing.  I loved the way Pete and his family rise about the tensions of the time and do not let it change them.  I love the determination to solve a mystery, at whatever cost, to settle young mans mind and heart.

There are multiple story lines going on, and each one is lesson in itself.  I loves Luesses story, Missing Isaac, and I look forward to reading more of her stories in the future.  Her experience of living in the south has given her imagination a multitude of settings as well as personal interactions over the years, that will make for some great characters!  She handles tough issues with candor and sensitivity that it can teach us all a few lessons in life.

This is a very clean and wonderful book to share with the young adults in the house, and I hope my boys read it so we can dig into some of the subjects addressed in the book!  There is a such a thread of redemption, forgiveness and love that I know they will enjoy the book and really hear a good message!!

Dylan is a man who has bipolar problems and he's been getting treated for this.  He has sworn off women, booze and whatever else seems to get him in trouble.  He wants to straighten his life and is going to do just that.

Emma is a woman who has problems of her own, not technically her but her family has connections with the mob and she has left her roots in New Jersey to try and start a new life and hide from her friends and family.  Her family doesn't know where she has run off too, but she does keep in contact with her dad.

Her ex-boyfriend, a big shot lawyer with money has found Emma and she doesn't know how or why he would even look for her when she made it clear that she no longer wanted to be with him when she left.

Emma and Dylan seem to have an undeniably strong attraction towards each other.  Dylan is trying his hardest to stay away from her but it becomes impossible for him when he finds out that someone has broken into Emma's place and he insists on her moving in with him.  Emma is thrilled he has asked her to move in with him because she likes him.  She's not shy to show him either that she wants him.

What is going to happen with these two beautiful people who like each other so much.  Will obstacles come in the way of them being happy?  I'm sure there is a happy ending, we just need to find out how it ends up a happy ending right!!

5990,"First, just let me say that I am in LOVE with John Parker McGuiness. When you finish this book, you will be too! For me, this touching story was about the rebirth of a woman (Tammy Hollins) who had never had a chance to know who she was. She came from privilege, but this book proved that money doesnt buy happiness, nor does it stop abuseboth mental AND physical. It is also about the healing power of love and trust and acceptance. Tammy found these things in the embrace of her family and John Parker  and the divorce from her husband Sterling, and her mother  her abusers.

I enjoyed watching Tammy opening uplike one of her flowerspetal by petal, day by day. The development of her relationship with John Parker was much the same. As she learned to trust, she opened more and more to allow the love of a wonderful man into her life  and the life of her children, Annabelle and Rory. THE CHOCOLATE GARDEN is the second book in the Dare River series. It is preceded by Country Heaven, which I recommend that you read first. It too, is an awesome book.

It was fun to catch up with Rye and Tory in this book. Tammy is a lucky girl to have Rye for a brother.  We also get to see the other characters in the series develop. You just want to get in the car and drive to Tennessee so that you can meet these people! Youll also want to grab a shovel and start digging up your back yard to plant your own chocolate garden!

The thing I love most about Ava Miles books is that they are so well written. The characters are multidimensional and well developed. Her voice is down to earth. The characters speak to you. You live the moments, they are not told to you. Romance fans and lovers of women's fiction will devour this poignant and tender novel.  It had me laughing, relating, sympathizing with, and outright loving Tammy, John Parker and the entire cast of supporting characters. With details, funny moments and interesting plot twists Ava Miles scores big with this novel. I highly recommend.

When Haller has a tough case and his investigator is injured, he asks Bosch to do the investigation.  This is a tough decision for Bosch, it would mean crossing the aisle from the prosecusion's side to the defense.  At first, Bosch thinks he can find out if the defendant is guilty without anyone knowing he's doing it.  And he's fairly sure the defendant is guilty.  But soon Bosch is asking a lot of questions and unfortunately it becomes known that he's on the defense's side.  This is very uncomfortable for Bosch.  He's been a cop too long to find it easy being on the defense's side.  But he can't stop himself from finding out the truth.  As a defense attorney, Haller is only interested in clearing his client, not finding who the real culprit is.  But Bosch can't ignore who is responsible.  The joy of reading about Haller's expertise in the courtroom is fairly short, but very satisfying.  It will be very interesting to find out what Bosch does in the next book.  Will he continue as Haller's investigator or find something else to occupy his time.  Connelly is great at developing a great plot with lots of unexpected twists and turns.

Were the perfect compliment to each other. I help him stay grounded and he helps me fly.

The Road Back to Us is an emotional and beautiful story of Iove finding its way home.

Every time we have a disagreement, promise me that youll fight for me and not against me. And that well always end it with a kiss.

Caroline and Bentley Harrison have a long history together that has included the normal ups and downs of dating and marriage. Somewhere along the way, we see that they lost track of one another and the important things. Now they are near their end. As we begin the story, we become privy to the inner workings of their relationship, and how they really feel about what is happening in their lives. A trip to pacify family members changes everything for them, and gives endless possibilities for the future.  Snacks, snow, a cabin, and the Mountain Man brighten our reading time and give us an unforgettable journey.

Lets go make fire, Romeo.

K. Webster is one of my favorite authors. Her stories are identifiable and make you want to pull up a chair and stay for a while. Well, this one actually made me want to grab my pillow and blanket and curl up on the couch with a box of tissues. What words would I use to describe this story? Honest, heart-breaking, and tearful. Then, beautiful, restorative, and awe-inspiring. I was captivated with the entire story. I connected with it on a level that was totally outside of the pages in a book. Every part of me was lost to their story, from beginning to end. I laughed with them, cried with them and danced around the room in the end. Outside of the main couple, one of my favorite characters was Harley. He rocked his part in the story, and that endingI am begging for more of him! Another great read from this author.

This is Liam and Becks story.
We met Liam in Again as Robin's best friend and in Liam helping Robin we find out about the man who got away when Liam was younger. We also meet Beck in the prior book as well as a friend of Cash's. We learn in this new story that it really is a small world.
This is a second chance story which are my favorite.
Both men were in love when they were teenagers and were torn apart when Liam moves away.
Now it is about 10 years later and at Cash and Robin's wedding they come face to face. Old feelings never died from either of them and it was great to see them try to pick up where they left off. Liam is a traveler and never stays in one place and Beck is a homebody who wants to settle down. They know they have to find middle ground if they want to be together. I really enjoyed that both men grew up and moved on with their lives but never forgot one another. Sierra has a way of writing that makes you heart smile when 2 men who are perfect for each other find their HEA.

Bliss is beautiful, both inside and out and Steven can see that. He is both sensitive and manly and Bliss is attracted to his strength. Their connection is explosive and they both know exactly what they want. They are confident and use that confidence to make their relationship work.

But like every love story, not everything is perfect and although Bliss and Steven care deeply about each other, a snake in the form of Caprice is out to disturb their paradise. Will they believe in the strength of their feelings or will Caprice succeed in coming between them?

I love Bliss and Steven and the fact that they're older, in their 30-40s. There isn't much drama between them because they know how to handle it. There is plenty of sexiness, yet the sweet moments are also present.

I also like the secondary characters. Nicki, Jack, Albie, and Finn are funny as all get out and bring a level of hilarity and lightness to the story. Each character adds their touch to make it more interesting and when you add Stevens dad and his wife, Melanie, to the mix, then you're in for a hella good time ;-) All these characters and their interactions add so much richness to an already wonderful plot.

Sandra has been crushed by past relationships and has no immediate plans to take a leap into another. She has too much on her plate right now to even think about beginning a new relationship anyway. The highest priority for her seems to be her brother that she feels may up to no good. She will do whatever it takes to keep him out of trouble. Shes definitely NOT going to let the fact that she thinks that the new boss man in her brothers life is hot as heck get in the way of doing just that!

Nick is the bad boy that Sandra feels the need to protect her brother from. Hes mysterious, tatted up, and screams danger. He seems to be up to no good, but is he really? Nick is hot, sexy, and oozes with charm. His attraction to Sandra may be strong, but he needs to keep focus on the job at hand. Easier said than done!

They quickly and easily fall into a seductive pattern of dirty talk, kinky hookups, and plenty of orgasms. It was unexpected how fantastic they complement and satisfy each other physical but once they start, there is no stopping.

They are both wonderfully genuine people so I really enjoyed following for their journey. It was easy to fall into the story and get wrapped up in the fun plot. She's spunky and independent so she never put up with any of his surly moods. He looks amazing in his police uniform and is extremely compassionate. The history you get about them along the way melted my heart. They ties that bind them are beyond powerful and I was so happy they decided to cross that seemingly unbreakable boundary.

Hailey was the perfect vehicle to remind him of a simpler time and a period when his family actually meant something to him.  It was a wonderful story about healing from all different types of loss and coming out stronger on the other side. I enjoyed every page and look forward to the Grand Mrs Westerly's evolution.

Hope is ready to take this next step in her life and she is all to happy to do it with Chance. But when family and friends starting asking whats next she is faced with weather Chance can put the past in the past and make the biggest promise of all. Can love conquer it all?
This book reminds me of when you use to write your best friend a letter and you had to patiently wait for the rest of the story and it comes and you are already in love with it. The one thing that kind of drove me nuts through out this story was Chance and his second guessing Hope's true motives. I loved how amazing and grounded Hope is. I loved how even when you don't have ""family"" you make family. I grew up that way so this story I get all to well. I felt like with all that Hope and her Dad had faced that the love that they showed in this book for each other and those in there lives was amazing and truly summed up that love with out end is pretty amazing even in the hurt. I really enjoyed how the author did word plays on there names so in deep points in the book you found yourself laughing. This book is going to make you laugh and cry thats for sure, but its also a great memory of how important love is. This book does have some adult language and scenes but so well worth the read.",4,"[-1.757737288135845, -1.380320225748851, -1.1661956427606526, -1.023061281231074, -1.1115716834158822]",-1.023061281231074

5870,"GIDEON by Cherry Adair is a fast paced, action packed Romantic Suspense. #2 in the ""Lodestone"" series, but can be read as a stand alone. I would suggest reading #1 ""Hush"", just because this is an outstanding series, thus far. Another, T-FLAC novel. Thrills and chills, twists and turns, as well, passion, suspense, and romance. A roller- coaster of a thrill ride from beginning to the end and beyond.

Well written with tantalizing scenes, vivid descriptions, charismatic characters, adventure, action, and of course a track through the Jungle with an enemy on their trail (the reader can almost taste, feel and smell the Jungle). The H/H is awesome, oh wait, they are engaging, charismatic, energetic and did I mention passionate, in more ways than just sex. Although, the sensual tension is just as awesome, as well. A keeper! Another hit from another awesome Romantic Suspense author! Well done! I look forward to the next installment of this high-octane adventure. The  T-FLAC team is a tough as nails unit. Another hit from Cherry Adair. Highly recommended for Romantic Suspense fans and anyone who enjoys a thrill-ride packed full of action, romance and love. Any more heat and action and the pages would be on fire. Simply, breathless and priceless!! If you only pick up one Romantic Suspense, this month, let it be ""Gideon"", you will not regret your choice!
