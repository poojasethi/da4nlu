3143,"The Beck and Olson book reveals some startling facts
about the current school system in contrast to counterparts
overseas. For instance, the Finnish education system sits at
the top. The success story in Finland is attributed to hiring the
best and brightest, training them well and allowing teachers
to function unhindered by too much administrative interference.

Surprisingly, Vietnam's school children rank higher than the US in
some key areas. The Beck and Olson book has a considerable
discussion on home schooling which is a necessary part of life
in communities that are out of reach of major school districts and
population areas.

In addition, today's advanced technologies provide for a much better
outreach of technology into rural areas. Technological innovations
include the internet, more advanced language instruction like Pimsleur,
electronic books over paper copy and a plethora of educational games
too numerous to mention. Soon, the 3D Printing technologies will enter
the virtual classroom in a very big way.

The debate on teacher tenure continues to go on in many places.
Proponents argue that tenure is needed to protect the considerable
professional investment of time and money made by teachers.
Detractors argue that there is no easy way to terminate bad teachers.
There is no easy sequence of administrative steps to either keep tenure
or eliminate it.

Dr Miguel Faria argues that ""From 1950 to 1992, we have witnessed a
25 point drop in the SAT math scores and a 50 point drop in the SAT
verbal scores, and they have continued to plummet and remain at the
bottom of the barrel since that time."" At bottom, we need to address this
problem by getting children to read more quality literature and solve
more involved critical thinking problem sets in math and science. Then,
America's primary education system will return to a higher ranking when
compared to Europe, Asia and elsewhere. America's considerable
university system and its professions are still the envy of the world.

For the time being, the Common Core is still in an evolving state.
And so, it's too early to judge the efficacy of the effort since the new
standards are in an early stage of development. Clearly, the effort
to increase formal schooling from 13 to 14 years via Pre-Kindergarten
will expose children to language acquisition and application at an
earlier age.",3,"[-1.6192110601159635, -3.0181385635059494, -1.9852100196288585, 1.1836945987942353, -2.7828926663324913]",1.1836945987942353

Pros:
Superior clumping
Works great in regular or self cleaning litter boxes
Corn based, so it can be flushed down the toilet
Texture is cat paw friendly
Fragrance is cat owner friendly
Earth friendly ingredients

Cons:
Company reduced the size from 17 pounds to 14 pounds, but didn't lower the price
Company also reduced the 34 pound bag to 28 pounds without lowering the price

I've been using World's Best Cat Litter for many years and have always been very satisfied with the product. I've used it in regular litter boxes, as well as in the self cleaning ones. It's the only brand that I've used that does not clog a self cleaning litter box, which is a huge plus. In addition, since the litter is corn based, it can be flushed down the toilet. Currently I'm using it for one cat and have a standard litter box. I scoop out the waste once a day and flush it down the toilet. I've never encountered a situation where the litter has clogged the toilet, thus making it a breeze to clean the box and dispose of the clumps. The earth friendly materials and pleasant scent add to the quality of this litter. My only complaint is that the company recently downsized both the 34 pound and 17 pound bags, making the litter more expensive to use. It's a 5 star product, but I'm giving it 4 stars, as the downsizing makes it more expensive than the competition.

I'm telling you what.....my husband would probably sleep in these suspenders (or braces as he prefers to call them) if he could.  This is the first time he's tried suspenders and I must say he looks really good in them.  He put them on the first day they arrived and has worn them every day since .  I went with him to a doctor's appointment last week and he was positively blushing from all the complements he was getting.  Now I'm wondering if I've made a serious mistake.  ;-)

We picked the wine stripe and somehow that color seems to go perfectly with every shirt/pants combination he's tried them with so far.  The three gripper pieces are good and strong and don't pop free from the waistband.  The adjustment bars on the front are also strong and have not allowed the placement he settled on for length to slip at all.

The main problem is that she is forbidden to be with a supernatural and must ""join"" with a human to try and get pregnant. Gretchen has been fighting this for years and it looks like she is running out of time and excuses.

Alek Melos is a Gryphon and one of the caretakers in Sanctuary. He is not close to many in Sanctuary but has formed a special bond with Gretchen although he knows he is forbidden to act on it.

When Rose gives Gretchen and Alek a way to be together will they agree to her terms? With their enemy Xerxes getting closer will the conflicts in Sanctuary give him a way to finally achieve his own goals of bringing Rose down?

This book was super good but so ominous. I am so freaked out with what will happen next as this one left me really wondering if Sanctuary can stop Xerxes with everything that happened.

I understood why Gretchen wanted to hold out for the man she loved but with everything that happened at the end I wonder if it was worth it all. I am hoping something super powerful comes out as a result of what happened. I was mad at her when she left Alek's place as we know how that turned out.

I really liked Alek and how he wanted to do what was right but that his heart really wanted Gretchen. He was strong and powerful but he definitely had her as his weakness.

Eric H. Cline is an active archaeologist as well as a professor at Georgetown, and more importantly he is also an excellent writer, able to tell some colorful and amusing anecdotes and sprinkle  humorous asides and observations throughout his scholarship.

In the twelfth century B.C. the eastern Mediterranean world was enjoying a prolonged period of international contact, with goods being traded over a wide area of thriving civilizations, from Mycenae and Crete to Egypt up through Anatolia and into much of the rest of what is now known as the Middle East.  There was plenty of conflict between competing empires, but even battles and long military campaigns increased cross cultural trade and other contacts.  Then, beginning roughly around the year 1177 BC, a series of calamities brought these early examples of globalization to a halt.  There were numerous earthquakes, the climate changed in the form of a prolonged drought, resulting in increased unrest and migrations which led to the invasions of the so-called Sea Peoples, wars over resources became bitterer and more prolonged, and the Eastern Mediterranean entered a Dark Age.  Eventually new civilization centers arose, with new trade products and routes, and the old order was replaced with one from which Western civilization eventually was to develop.

Cline's experience and knowledge of archaeology led him to include many fascinating stories of discoveries, like buried cities and sunken Bronze Age sailing ships, which added color to his narrative.  He does a masterly job of examining different scenarios and analyzing their strengths and weaknesses, in the end explaining that the late Bronze Age came to an end from a general systems collapse due to interconnections which had become overly complex and delicate, so that one small disruption (as in the ""butterfly effect"") could eventually lead to a cascading series of disasters.  This, as Cline points out several times, is particularly pertinent information today as we make our way through the aftermath of a prolonged financial crisis.",3,"[-3.7800868391260347, -3.3879080552665912, -1.8471344480204441, 1.1823704997109719, -4.165450108792287]",1.1823704997109719

Pros:
Access Point - This is the default mode and worked perfectly in all my tests.  This mode is this unit's main asset and makes it so you can use tablets and smart phones on Wi-Fi.  In addition, you could use this mode at home for guests so you don't have to give out your main password/etc.  Almost a brainless setup in AP mode.  I could get this to operate quickly when using it out of the box in the default Access Point (AP) mode.

Cons:
Repeater Mode - Repeater mode didn't seem to work for me.  After setting it up, it looked successful on the router's web menu page.  However, I used a Wi-Fi channel scanner on both my Android phone and laptop and there was no noticeable difference in the signal I was trying to boost.  Disappointing as this was the mode I was most hoping to use this router for.
Minor Cons:
Bridge Mode - Seems to let you use ONLY the same channel as the parent router.  This is sort of logical since the internal WR700N radio can only use one channel at a time.  If it had 2 radios, it could obviously upload on one and download on the other.  While this mode is still useful, it is not as useful as if it could use a different channel than the bridged signal.

7390,"This is my favorite Dire Straits album with good reason.  It's easily their most ambitious album, and the musicianship is pretty damn awesome.  Who says there was no good music in the 1980's?  This was also the last time they were experimental, as their next album, Brothers in Arms, was a monster hit and they pretty much fell apart after that (only one more studio album came out from them).  Many people like to talk about the length of the first song, Telegraph Road, without mentioning the actual song.  The song is a majestic epic, almost like a mini rock opera symphony.  The last 5 minutes or so are some of the most intense playing that these guys ever did.  The 2nd song, Private Investigations, is atmospheric and moody, but it's not a favorite.  I love the Industrial Disease song, with its still timely lyrics and its bouncy beat (god, that sounds corny).  The title track is similar in tone to Private Investigations.  It's OK.  It Never Rains, as many have said, has a major Dylanesque vibe to it, and it's a great song to close the album with.

It's a shame Dire Straits broke up.  Knopfler just released his first solo album in a very long time, and honestly, it's not very good.  I heard it at work, and I nearly fell asleep.  But we still have this album, one of the most adventurous albums that Dire Straits ever made, and, in my opinion, their best album.",3,"[-2.0784183353923447, -3.099746472727137, -2.0490727707220606, 1.18204658712899, -3.184704672869394]",1.18204658712899

550,"""Stones into Schools"" is a feel-good update/report to supporters of Greg Mortenson's unfortunately-named Central Asia Institute, which promotes girls' education in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  In this report, he answers the questions of would-be doubters:  Why build schools when these countries suffer from so many other more pressing problems?  Do NGOs have an impact on the local community, and if so how?  What is the long-term impact of international NGOs?

It's a well-written and very savvy book that pulls at your heartstrings while at the same providing clear and concrete information of the particular difficulties of working in Afghanistan.  I like the way that Greg Mortenson weaves in the story of his father (a Christian medical missionary who's greatest dream, at a time when Africa was still under siege from the colonial mindset) was to build a hospital that locals would one day run.  At the end, we learn that Mortenson's local colleagues have learned independence and initiative, and now are implementing dreams of their own.  That, according to the book, is why the CAI (again, it's unfortunately-named) is so valuable:  not only because it gives hope to so many girls, but also because it opens so many vistas and possibilities for all Afghans.

This can at times be a moving and informative book, but it really wasn't written by Mortenson, and most of the time hearing from the CAI spokesman is both annoying and jarring.",3,"[-3.1072462862209433, -4.19833571554041, -2.130658431893007, 1.1813355192502444, -3.0815546802312994]",1.1813355192502444

746,"There are so many books out there that promise to help you find your path in life, to help you achieve meaning, that it's tough to know which one to read -- and which one will be different than the others.

I've read scores of these types of books, and ""The Purpose Driven Life"" is different in several ways. First, it offers you a step-by-step plan for creating a sense of meaning in your life. Second, it's based in scripture. Third, it advocates making the church the center of your life.

These differences can also be the book's drawbacks. I always sensed that the author had a bit of an agenda -- being a pastor of a huge church, of course he believes in the importance and sanctity of organized religion. But what if you aren't a member of a church? What if your church is dysfunctional? What if you feel called to do things outside your church?

I for one believe that God has given us different talents and different strengths and different passions. SOME of us are called to serve in the church. And some of us are called elsewhere. Warren seems to ignore those of us who are pulled to serve others and use our talents outside of our church. After reading this book twice (once on my own and once through a small-group study through my church), I was still left with many, many questions -- and a deep-seated feeling that there was more to life than what Warren had presented.",3,"[-2.7726775369755123, -3.1902013601140444, -1.7345067531024387, 1.180461379577954, -3.551677597496606]",1.180461379577954

9389,"Since I got into the Harry Potter series a few months ago, I've been asking people what they think of it. To my surprise, most of them said they stopped after the Prisoner of Azkaban. Personally, I think Azkaban was the best one so far, so why not continue? The unanimous answer was that they didn't really want to see the kids grow up. In the Goblet of Fire, they aren't quite there yet, as in their 4th year at Hogwarts, the kids are 14. The story this time isn't centered around some mysterious artifact or person, but rather a world wide competition of student wizards. The Goblet of Fire decides who the best of the best are, allowing only one student from each school to participate. This film was special, but also lacked some of the intrigue that got us addicted to Harry Potter in the first place. Finally, a Harry Potter film focuses entirely on Harry and we get to see some of the great things that he is supposedly capable of. In fact, Ron and Hairmony's roles amount to little more than bit parts, where as in the other three films, they were all on equal ground. The fact that this was a competition takes something major away from the film. In the Goblet of Fire we aren't introduced to any new artifacts, games, or spells, there really isn't anything here that will amaze you. While it's a small thing, it's an expected thing, that does take something away from the film. What makes up for it is a terrific ending, that has to be seen in order to continue on with the series. For years, I thought Harry Potter was just overrated, pop culture, bull s***, but once I sat down to actually watch it, I came to realize that this series is as magically as the world it portrays.

I just recommend this volume because it's not like the seasons are available and there's at least a lot of good episodes here. We get a lot of good episodes with top villains such as the Joker, Two Face, Catwoman, Scare Crow, Poison Ivy, ManBat, Croc, Clay Face and the Riddler.

  The Two Face episodes I think are the best since it has the one where Harvey Dent becomes Two Face. He's a Two Face that you can take seriously like the one in Dark Knight and unlike the one of Batman Forever. I also think the transformation from Dent to Two Face is handled better here than it was even in the Dark Knight. While the show is also worth checking out for Mark Hamil's voice over work as the Joker. He does such a ingenious job that it's pretty impossible to tell that Luke Skywalker talks for the Joker lol.

I had hoped it would fit a skinny 16 year old but it's simply too small in the chest and shoulders as 16 year olds develop more shape than 14 year olds. It would also fit some 12 year olds. Since it's got a higher percentage of cotton, it's comfortable to wear.

On a slightly separate note, it is made in Bangladesh. Many lives were lost in Bangladesh sweatshops in the last few years due to labor malpractice and non compliance with safety standards. It gave me some pause as I held this garment.

I have purchased several Hamilton Beach products in the past (irons, toasters, electric can openers blenders, etc) and haven't had a problem. Of course small appliances don't always have long lives. So if I get a few years out of them, I am satisfied. So selecting this toaster, especially because my old one stopped working, was a no brainer.

The Hamilton Beach 2 Slice Digital Toaster is definitely eye catching. And while I wish it would accommodate 4 slices of something versus two....because with four people in the house, toasting more of anything at one time is always better than just two...and who really likes cold toast (con). I do like the fact that you can defrost frozen treats (my kids love Toaster Strudel) with just a press of a button (it's marked with a snowflake). It can accommodate bagels and English muffins, or other over sized breads (I toasted some French bread in mine). [I will caution you to be careful when placing short items in this toaster, you may have to tilt to the side to remove because they do not always pop up far enough]. There is a handy little tray that pulls out and allows you to remove the crumbs that collect over time. This product is easy to clean, simply wipe (when cool) with a damp dish towel. It is reasonably priced when compared to other toasters on the market. I like that there is a cool, digital setting (function) for your food while I found that a 5 (which is the default setting) seemed to be too long/high. I prefer a lighter toast, so use 2 or even 1 instead. I didn't really like that it always defaults to 5 and you have to remember to adjust it, but I can't have everything...style and function. Overall, I have not had any problem with this toaster and I expect it to be a part of the family for some time to come.

751,"This is a simple to read and use quick start for a Daniel Fast. It's based on the book of Daniel in the Bible where Daniel refuses to eat the rich food at the Babylonian court. He asks to be tested on a simple diet and ends up healthier than the others who were eating all the delicacies and rich foods.

The book describes fasting and why it's important and how to prepare before the fast begins. It also gives you 21 days of devotions and a lot of recipes to get through the three week fast. The fast is intended to be a start to a healthier diet and lifestyle. It gives you a nice list of foods to eat and foods to avoid. (It's going to be hard to give up caffeine/coffee...) Really though, the list isn't bad. It's getting all the junk out of our diets that I'm not entirely sure we're supposed to be eating anyway. Sugars, refined carbs, dairy, meat, bread and artificial sweeteners...it's a heavy list but the point is well made that it's 21 days to make your body healthier.

The recipes and meal plans are really easy and I'm looking forward to trying them as we start our 21 day fast. We're still in the planning and preparing phase but we're looking forward to the changes it will make in our bodies and diets.

The size works for everything we microwave. If the diameter were greater, then the height would have to be greater. That's because instead of standing on top of a full-sized plate it would instead surround it - and thus lose height.

We don't fold and unfold this thing. If we did, I doubt it would last that long. We just leave it fully open all the time so as not to wear the folding joints.

This cover has lots of thin holes to let out steam, and that keeps it from shooting out of place under pressure. The whole thing needs to be washed more often than I expected because it smells of all the food that was warmed up in it.

Now the cover lets out excess steam, but not most of the steam. I noticed that everything warmed up with the cover on comes out moist - a good thing.

The tent is lightweight, but can actually fit three people (or two people with gear). The fabric used to make the tent seems incredibly strong, but it is soft at the same time -- making it easier to fold up when taking down! The zippers are smooth to open and close, and almost silent like the description says!

The rain fly is quite ingenious, I especially love having the ability to stargaze while still being protected from bugs and other things that wander in the night.

The clipping system was incredibly easy to use, both with putting together and taking the tent down. The first time I set it up, it took about 10 minutes to set up from start to finish.

My negatives, are the hard somewhat flexible plastic windows on the rain fly -- I am worried that will long term folding up of the windows and storage in a garage that often changes temperatures they may crack or become weakened.

Honest Kitchen is a very good brand and this broth is a great idea.  My dog has been given this as a dry additive and as a liquid broth and it has been wonderful!  I recommend it actually.

Honest Kitchen is a really excellent brand of natural and more healthy inputs for dogs.  I have greatly enjoyed their stuff in the past, even though it is freeze-dried and requires my human to put water, although frankly many times I have the straight dry stuff and still enjoy it on my kibble.

In this case this case, this stuff is bone broth.  I have tried for the chicken version for review and the beef broth my human purchased.  MMMMM.  I got the package and tried to as a dry additive to my kibble,  I loved it.  I ate it all up.  Even dry this is great.  The adding water part is nice and all, and I guess I eat that too, bit for me it sure didn't matter.

However, during a period when I wasn't feeling well, my human gave me the beef broth as a liquid and initials I didn't want it, but then I lapped it up and really loved it.  It was helpful and gave me strength.  I loved it!

I like the ingredients.  Cardamom?  Okay, still works.  Pleasant but slight smell to my human.  For me, this is pretty rich smelling but not as good as the trash cans, hydrants and other places where we leave messages. Call waiting?  Doesn't;t quite work.

The manufacturer claims that the sharpeners should last for several years but, surprise, you can get double its life by reversing the bits - all you need is to remove 2 screws, reverse the bits and then tighten the screws back.

For non-commercial users, the manufacturer promises to fix or replace any unit for any reason if the owner returns it with $4.00 to cover postage and handling. There are no lawyery warranty exclusions or exorbitant fees or requests to provide extensive documentation. Now THAT's what I call a honest warranty policy.

Her old crate had a crack in the bottom tray so it was useless for keeping urine off the carpet.  Plus, I recently moved to a new house and needed to move the dog over separately from her pen.  So I needed a functional crate for her.  I went with the 48 inch crate (single door) since she is a full grown Rottweiler (about 85-90 pounds).  There was a bit of additional room for a water dish and toys, and my dog was able to stand up fully, turn around, etc., but not to go wild in this crate.

This crate was the perfect size.  It was easy to put together and it was sturdy once assembled.  (It comes with a divider in case you are training a large-breed puppy.  So you only have to buy one crate instead of a series of larger and larger ones as your puppy grows.  Instead, you can just move the divider.  I am not using the divider since I bought this for an adult dog.)  The door is easy to open and close and the coating on the bars is smooth and unbroken.

In the end, I was really happy with this.  It was exactly what I was looking for.

8019,"I mail out alot of packages and use alot of packaging tape. And sometimes I have fights with the tape -- it is either too thin, it sticks to itself when I unroll it, it has a mind of its own and wrinkles just as I am about to tape up the package, and if I should forget to create a little ""tape tab"" so I can easily unwind it from the roll the next time, I engage in the ""battle of the tape"" where I pick at it until I find a starting point, only to unravel pieces of the tape in an endless spiral -- what a waste of tape and money, eh?

So after receiving, trying and using this, I am VERY happy with this Scotch Super Strength Packaging Tape 3850-6. It is User Friendly! It is STRONG, It is Tenacious -- I affixed a 10 inch length of the tape from a roll of tape hanging onto a fixed object the other day and the roll did not drop down to the floor from its own weight -- the tape stuck and even the exposed part was just as sticky as ever a few days later. I left a used roll of tape un-tabbed for a few days in a warm kitchen - the cut end of the tape was retrievable without tearing and without my losing any portion of the tape when I pulled it open. Bravo!

UNLIKE some thicker plastic tape which will not conform to the shape of the package, THIS tape DOES - very willingly -- My packages are mailed out now knowing that parts of the tape will not decide to get stuck to something at the post office and pull off.

It is crystal clear, wide enough to tape up a package with fewer passes, it works well in those plastic hand-held tape dispensers and truth be told, it cuts very easily, even if all you want to use as a cutter is your teeth.",3,"[-1.853943439956019, -2.201683506902496, -2.1128243348966045, 1.1739070522012245, -3.2719943061672545]",1.1739070522012245

When I went to visit my mother-in-law in Florida, I discovered that she had purchased a medical alert bracelet that required an Internet connection. The main unit for the medical device, required that the single Ethernet cable she had, be plugged into the back of the unit. Since I wanted to use my laptop computer, and there was no wireless connection available, I wasn't sure what to do. My brother-in-law, who lives in the same condo complex, let me use his computer to search for something on Amazon that would solve the problem. After searching for a while; I came across this Ethernet switch made by Lynksys and made the purchase.

Setting it up couldn't have been easier. First I plugged the Ethernet switch into a wall outlet. Than, I removed the main Ethernet cable from the medical device and plugged it into port number one on the switch. Next, I plugged the medical device into port number two. Finally, I plugged my laptop into port number three. The only extra items that I had to purchase were two 6' Ethernet cables which I used for the medical device and my laptop computer. The entire set-up took less than 5 minutes and the results were exactly what I had hoped for. I'm able to use my laptop computer at the same time that my mother-in-law's medical device is in use.

3111,"I wasn't sure what I was going to get with this book, but I've been really surprised and have had a hard time putting it down each day. The author makes sure to point out that the stories aren't about what crazy people are doing, but what God does through (sometimes) crazy people or situations. It shows how God can redeem a sinful person or act for His purposes.

For example, the story of Lot and his daughters. I hadn't thought before that they may have assumed that God destroyed the world, seeing as they witnessed the destruction of their town. They thought they were all that was left and had to rebuild the population (yuk). But God used that and has descendants of these acts in the lineage of Jesus.

Another example is the story of Elijah and the bear. Seems harsh that a man of God would call out a bear to maul people who were mocking him. Seems harsh that God would allow it. The point in the book is that God used this example to show that He requires proper respect for the people doing His work.

The band is just large enough to fit without pulling for me, but if you have a bigger head they might be too small for you. The buds fit and don't fall out but they don't really seal very well despite changing the ear buds supplied with them, so don't expect total soundproofing.

7530,"I have been using this lens for five years, and have probably taken over 1000 photographs with it, film and full-frame digital, with sky filters, colored filters for black & white film, and polarizing filters as appropriate. As time has passed, I find that I use it less and less, because I can almost always get better results with something else.

I have often found a kind of harsh contrast to the photographs I take with this lens. When using it, I have to be particularly diligent about lighting as a result. Zoom is convenient for composing but the camera is not optimal for controlling distracting backgrounds; this lens is certainly not appropriate for portraits.

Only once did I get pictures with this lens that were much better than I expected, when handheld photos at maximum zoom on slow film in a dark temple came out perfectly. That's entirely a credit to the image stabilizer.

Nowadays, I regard this as a snapshot lens; as such, it's often superseded by a point-and-shoot camera which takes pictures almost as well and is a lot easier to carry around.",3,"[-4.472417127348742, -2.350511882344784, -1.215047260039658, 1.1716446192144547, -3.6095015323741295]",1.1716446192144547

So I thought I'd be in for a fight when the vet said she needed an inhaler for her asthma. There was just no way she would let me shove this cone in her face. I watched some videos on how to get the cat used to the device. I put the rubber nose piece out by her, I put a treat in the there to entice her to put her face near it, I put the plastic chamber near her, then I put it together and set it near her again. This was over the span of a week. Let me tell you, every time I put it near her, she got up and walked off. So I had to do the gator wrangler move. Where you secure them, then maneuver your body over the top of theirs while making sure they don't run away. Yeah, that was the only way I was able to get this thing near her face. That's when I started to test the water. I'd put it up to her face for a minute and then give her a treat. A couple days of this went on and then I decided we weren't making progress, she needed her meds, and it was time to just bite the bullet. For about 3 months I had to hover over her on the floor in order to give her her medication. Each time I'd immediately give her a treat and then feed her breakfast/dinner (she needs her asthma medication every 12 hrs so I timed with with feedings). Now I no longer need to wrangle her. She knows that without getting her ""puff puff"" she doesn't get the treat or food. So she's come to terms with it.

Be prepared for a fight. Come up with idea that will help make the experience less traumatic for them based on your pets drive. Maybe they have a favorite toy? Only let them have that toy AFTER they have the device at their nose.

3039,"Qadir Yaseen knows that Israel can never be defeated as long as America arms it. But Israel, the nation that stole hs homeland destroyed his entire family, and caused the deaths of so many others must be destroyed. So Qadir comes up with a monumental plot to destroy, or at least distract America for years--long enough for the Arab world to rise againstIsrael. Qadir is cetain that God is on his side.

With his marriage in tatters, NCIS (Naval Criminal Investigative Service) Commander Will Coburn isn't at all sure God is on his side. Still, whe one of his teemmates is murdered, Will goes to work tracking down the killer. What he finds initially doesn't seem to add up. Over time, though, it begins to make a horrible kind of sense. Will has caught a small piece of Qadir's plan. But Qadir has been plotting for years and Will has only days to uncover the full truth. It would take a miracle to stop the destruction.

Author Mel Odom delivers an action-packed thriller. Will and his team face Columbian druglords, Hispanic assassins, the Korean Maffia, and Arab warriors willing to die (and kill) for their faith. Odom has researched his crime-scene techniques and the investigation felt very real and pressing as the team traveled the world in search of clues.

The religious aspect of this story is a bit heavy-handed for the secular reader. Odom leaves the reader with no doubt that Qadir's God is not the real God of the ultra-Christian NCIS. Bringing this message home strongly, the Christian God repeatedly delivers on behalf of the NCIS team. The book's target audience (Tyndale is a Christian publisher), however, will definitely approve of the message. Considering this, I thought Odom did a fine job motivating Qadir, explaining how his loss of two families (including young children) to Israeli attacks, drove him to adopting his extreme plan.

The generally fast-paced story occasionally bogged down over religion, praying, and especially Will's concern over his upcoming divorce. With saving the world at stake, surely Will could have put the impending divorce on the back burner--especially given that he had separated many months before the story began. Still, once Odom gets back into action, though, PAID IN BLOOD is compelling reading, especially for the Christian target market.",3,"[-4.444872395626799, -3.5178534301797937, -2.4883732084913817, 1.1687952372853094, -2.5386029562836274]",1.1687952372853094

He's been caught unprepared by two renegade Demons who have been attacking Nightwalkers and Lycanthropes, and the renegades' human necromancers and grievously injured.  He's saved before he can be killed by Siena, the Lycanthrope Queen.  While he's being nursed back to health, sparks fly between him and Siena.  This means trouble for both of them since lying with Lycanthropes is against one of the Demon Laws and because during the centuries-long war between the Demons and Lycanthropes (spurred on by Siena's crazy father and with a fragile peace just brought about by Siena), Elijah was one of the great slayers of Lycanthropes, earning the hatred of many of Siena's people.  Also, Lycanthrope Queens can mate only once and that is forever, and Siena does not want to mate with any man who may threaten her crown.

The attacks of the renegade Demons create a bit of suspense while Elijah and Siena (mostly Siena) try to sort out their relationship.  I liked most of the roadblocks to their relationship, since they seemed reasonable enough, and different, at least.  Elijah was interesting because he's obviously a great fighter and worthy enough to partner with a very strong Queen, but doesn't have any alpha-male hang-ups about being with a powerful woman.

Plus the cost was less per stick than it was in Dollar General for the original Tasters Choice.  I was skeptical about what difference the Colombian bean could make in instant coffee.

All the events described in the Bible are brought to life quite engagingly, with intelligent and dramatic dialogue and almost perfect casting.
Leonard Nimoy captures the courage and confidence of the young David, and Nathaniel Parker plays the title role of King David just as he was meant to be.
Sterling roles by Franco Nero as the prophet Nathan, and Sheryl Lee as an alluring and engaging Batsheba, who will be a source of courage and strength for David, and will be instrumental in the epic finale opening the way for the reign of Solomon (Luke Elliot) who is a young child at the end of the film . The scene where Saul consults the witch of Eindor to summon the spirit of Samuel is eerily brilliant and the witch played prefectly.
The scene where Nathan confronts David is particularly stirring.
The rape of Tamar played by the lovely Clara Beller gives us a new sympathy for the girl and her destruction by the wicked Amnon (Edward Hall) while a brilliantly arrogant and calculating Absalom is played by Dominic Rowan. This movie progresses with great flow and there is never a dull moment

It looks like a thin broth soup with shreds of real chicken meats and few tiny dices of sweet potatoes in it. Upon peeling the foil lid off the tub, the food has a fresh and aromatic smell, quite appetizing to me as a human. My dog seemed hesitant about it initially, Perhaps she wasn't used to such a soupy food. After some encouragement, she took a liking to it and finished it immediately. She seemed to want more afterwards.

While this is a nice and healthy food with limited ingredients (chicken, chicken broth, sweet potato, canola oil, etc), the portion is quite small. There is probably about a spoonful of solid food and the rest is just froth. It's great as a snack or a treat. However, it's probably too small to be a full meal by itself unless you have a toy dog.

I had to walk the delicate balancing act of increasing volume on both items to some sort of equilibrium, without using too much power from the device (leading to what seemed like higher battery drain) or too much from the speaker (leading to static noise).

Thus, when I saw this device, it seemed too good to be true. I thought, ""surely it must have an internal battery that will wear out over time."" Nope, it runs solely on AC power. Then I thought, ""surely it requires some weird audio adapter."" Nope, it uses a standard headphone plug. So I took the gamble and bought it.

If what you want is a simple speaker with no controls (not even a power switch) that you can plug into any normal headphone-style port, with enough volume to fill a normal-sized room (like a dorm room or living room), and you're not concerned about super-high audio quality or big bass tones, this is the speaker for you. It has a small form factor and footprint -- about the size of a spindle of 50 CD-R's, so if you have limited desk/counter space, it will serve you well. Again, it's not going to blow out the windows, and it's not going to satisfy audiophiles who spend hundreds of dollars on headphones. It will, however, serve to amplify your smartphone, mp3 player, laptop, or other standard audio device up to maximum volumes that are unlikely to hurt your ears.

One thing -- if you're not picky about the color, check the prices on the different colors of them. I didn't care what color mine was, so I looked and saw that the pink one was cheaper than the others -- ten dollars cheaper than the gray one at the time I bought it.",3,"[-1.614597256053651, -3.019880811899937, -1.745435143290896, 1.166101259376198, -3.7524965084148363]",1.166101259376198

 In my opinion, this is the perfect tablet for anyone that does graphic arts, photo editing, educational tutorials (such as math or English), or just loves to draw! My 15 year old son finds it a huge help when logging in online to the ""Math help"" websites, where he needs to draw out the equations he needs help with as there is no way to type out the symbols for the math problems that he has in Calculus.

I also found quite a few useful features on it such as the built in pen holder, the ability to turn a switch and make it responsive to touch instead of stylus (making the tabled one huge track pad), and the programmable buttons both on the tablet, and stylus.

I also noticed that the surface of the tablet more closely resembles an actual piece of paper because it is slightly abrasive (unlike most tablets).

Not only is the hardware great, but also the software. The driver's disk that it comes with is very easy and fast to install. It also comes with four different pieces of software: Adobe Photoshop Elements 11, Autodesk Sketchbook Express, Corel Painter Lite and Nik Color Efex Pro we3.

Also, this tablet is a good looking piece of Tech! It is very thin and stylish so it fits in perfectly on my minimalistic computer desk!

I am floored by how poorly these are made.  The right hand pointer finger is not sewn correctly.  It twists so that at the top of the finger the seam is on the finger rather than along side the finger.  That seam will not last.  To add insult to injury these are huge!  I ordered a size small & a size small is what arrived.  I can wear another pair of gloves inside these gloves!  That is how big they are!  On top of that despite having a pair of gloves under this pair, the fingers are still too long & the gloves slide down my hand to my wrist making matters worse.  The elastic around the wrist is a joke.  Without the pair of gloves under these gloves the elastic hangs around my wrist, it doesn't even grip it.  It barely grips with another pair of gloves underneath.  I can literally bend the tips of the finger down they are so long.  The pinkie finger is crazy long.  They have padding but it could be a lot better.  I am going to save these for Winter use since I can fit gloves for warmth underneath.  Wearing them is uncomfortable due to the long fingers & constant need to pull the gloves up.  I don't want to use them, but I don't want to throw them out either.  I doubt they will hold up past one Winter so at least I won't have to suffer them too long.

I was going to rate these 1 star, but they are better (for padding) then the Mechanics Wear brand which are ultra thin, too big & don't last.  So these are just barely better than them.  I just ordered another pair of Youngstown gloves.  I know they will wear out but at least they fit & have excellent padding & features geared towards women!  So far they are the best work gloves I have found.  I do a lot of hard work & my hand are very slender & small.

This usually is deadly in the case of a movie but it is definitely needed to make this movie work.  A claustrophobic atmosphere is required for this to work.

To eleven of the jurors this is an open and shut case but to one (Henry Fonda) things don't quite shape up.  Most of the jurors have other things to do and just want to get this over with.  But as they go over the evidence one by one the jurors must face the facts don't add up.

This is a brilliant look at the jury process.  Each of the twelve jurors were given their own backstory and personality.  This was an early directorial effort of Sidney Lumet and he shows early on what he is capable of doing.

Fonda once again gives a well measured performance.  He shows that he has a great command of drama.  Add to Fonda, film an stage veterans Lee J Cobb, Ed Begley and EG Marshall plus newcomers Jack Klugman and Robert Webber and you have a powerhouse cast.

And if you think you know the origin of the title of the book, you may well be wrong. It's not the Christmas hymn ""Silent Night,"" at least not directly. Rather, it comes from Andrew Peterson's ""Labor of Love.""

Pastor Adam Hamilton (of The United Methodist Church of the Resurrection in Kansas) presents here the story of Mary in achronological order, beginning with her death, proceeding to Jesus' death, and ultimately leading to His birth. Because Scripture tells us very little about key parts of the story (Mary, for instance, is mentioned once between Jesus' resurrection and her death), Pastor Hamilton injects a great deal of supposition and a fair amount of personal anecdote. Indeed, I got the impression that ""Not a Silent Night"" was almost a collected series of sermons. The writing is almost conversational, and the digressions, especially into events from Pastor Hamilton's own life, seem intended to illustrate the modern applicability of an ancient story.

The book is certainly not an authoritative history, nor is it intended to be one. For example, where there is disagreement, Pastor Hamilton generally notes the different views (e.g., regarding the place of Mary's death) without taking sides. Rather, this book is an attempt to make Jesus' story, and that of His mother, clearer by dispelling a few myths, by making certain points clearer, and by putting events in simple language and an attempt to underscore the continued relevance of the story for the twenty-first century. On the latter point, Pastor Hamilton begins the book with the story of a man's death on Black Friday, when crowds at a store trampled someone in an effort to save money.",3,"[-1.6316749904117644, -1.6699197758637532, -1.2587268231179345, 1.163465472108525, -4.2073369874874995]",1.163465472108525

No questions, ifs, ands, or buts.  Now you're lucky to see a person bagging your groceries much less take them to your car.  Two days ago I had to ask for carry out service (I usually do it myself but I'm recuperating from pneumonia).  That isn't the policy of this chain.

Here's the thing with these specific pants.  They are kind of thin.  You can see the pockets through the material, especially if you are wearing dark colored boxers.

Just take them out of the dryer right away.

I also had slight issue with the length.  I bought the 32"" inseam and they seemed long to me when I put them on.

With that background, I've heard so many good things about the Keurig process, I couldn't resist ordering this one as a Black Friday special.

So far, I am not disappointed, or not yet. The machine was pretty easy to set up and it makes coffee quickly. As for the quality... I'm used to grind and brew my own so... no, it's not 'just as good', not even close but this should largely depend of the specific Keurig flavor used and I've only tried a couple so far. Definitely better than the horrors that our office machine brews though.

The specific pod coffee flavor aside, brewing a cup, once the machine is plugged in and the water reservoir is full is as easy opening up the top intake, dropping in a fresh pod, closing it up, selecting the 'size' and pushing the 'on' button. Coffee is ready in less than a minute. By the way, they have 5 sample pods in the box but those I've tried didn't impress me. Like I said, you can pick your favorite size (S, M, L) but there is not 'strength' selector. Sadly, there isn't enough room for me to stick any of my relatively tall travel mugs underneath so I must have this intermediate step where the coffee is first delivered into a shorter mug, then I pour it into my taller one.

So far so good but I will still brew my own coffee every time I feel like drinking 'good' coffee. I am still optimistic that I will eventually find some good flavor.

152,"Crowley (formerly Crawly--the serpent in the garden of Eden) and the angel Aziraphale have been working for centuries, spreading a little evil (or good), yet building a sort of accommodation as well. Both have come to enjoy their human charges--and the unexpected decisions they make. Well, yes, the world really is a sort of Chessboard where God and Satan play out their game, but it's a nice Chessboard, and Crowley and Aziraphale would miss it if it were gone.

When Crowley gets word that the time has come, the Anti-Christ is ready for delivery, he knows better to disobey orders. He drops the infant at the hospital run by Satanic nuns and authorizes the switch. Neither he, nor Aziraphale expect the minor mixup--the infant Anti-Christ going to a working class English couple rather than to the American diplomat scheduled to receive him. Prophesy keeps its schedule, of course--helped along by the ""Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch."" The four riders of the apocalypse (with pollution replacing plague) don't require ancient Biblical battlegrounds to create the end of the world--they can do their work from well-connected Air Force bases on English soil. And with his power suddenly awakening, and filled with visions of UFOs, environmental destruction, hollow earth, and Tibetan tunnels spanning the globe, Adam Young, the Anti-Christ, is ready to create a new world--a better world where his three friends can each rule continents.

Authors Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett combine to create a story that is simultaneously laugh-out-loud funny and highly thoughtful. Admittedly, the characters are a bit one-dimensional (but then, it's hard to expect War, Death, and the like to have really complex characters), but they ask interesting questions. Gaiman and Pratchett deliver plenty of British humor and the type of offbeat characters that make their works so popular.

I could accept the son surviving 8 weeks on the Site B island...but the parents were just useless.  If anyone should've been eaten by the big dinosaurs, it was the obnoxious mother yelling her son's name all over an island crawling with prehistoric predators (shouting with a bullhorn at one point!).  Does she get killed?  Not a chance!  The heavily-armed mercenaries get it one by one...but not the loud mother crashing through the brush.  You just know that no harm will ever come to certain characters in this movie...so the dinosaurs don't become a threat after the last mercenary is killed and eaten.

7462,"I'm wearing these right now. They're a little stiffer than I expected, but not uncomfortable at all. The fit: let's be clear here about how to fit clothes made by workwear manufacturers. There is no vanity sizing, like you might find at some retailers. These are more or less true to size. That means get a measuring tape or something and actually measure yourself where you wear your trousers. That number is the number you should go with for your waist size on these trousers. Yes, that fashion retailer may make pants that fit you at 38, but if you measure their actual waistband you'll find that those are 40 or even 41 inches in circumference. So measure your waist and buy that size. If you like a little breathing room, measure your waist over your clothes and buy a belt.

Now, as for the appearance of these trousers? Perfectly passable for business casual. The cut is more or less straight (little to no flare or taper). I'm wearing them now with a jacket and tie, and no one has looked askance or asked any questions. They're not going to be as formal as dress pants, but they're also not going to look like you're coming off a job site, either. Also, I won't wear them with my leather-soled oxfords -- but boots? Sure. I don't know how good they'd be for casual wear (like a night on the town), but maybe in colors other than black they would work for that.

The main reason is her seven year old niece Holly. We find Holly quite infatuated with all the newness of Amish life, like most children, their love the animals. Dogs, cats, horses, cows....a dream place. Can you imagine being a child and ending up at an Amish 3 hour service in German? She had to be one sweet girl to endure what was so unfamiliar to her. She has all this family she has never known.
This is not your typical Amish story, and the reality of everything that has happened to both Rachael and Holly. Will Rachael be able to return to her previous life after being with the Amish?

I always find it difficult pulling the dry erase markers in and out of the little clips attached to the white boards--half the time, the clip itself falls off, the board knocks down, etc.  Having a marker that attaches to the boards magnetically makes things SO much easier.

The magnets on these are markers are fairly strong and work decently.  I am not sure why they were made to be so narrow, however--I think that if they were wider, they would have worked even better.  The markers themselves write well, although I think the idea of advertising them as having ""3 widths"" is somewhat overrated--yes, you can turn the marker to achieve different widths, but the line you will get is not nearly as distinct as what is pictured in the item description.

Sound engineering and orchestration are both superb, and the musical styles are varied and fun while staying in the ""pops"" range.  This album will find a welcome place in anyone's Yuletide sound library, and would make a thoughtful gift too -- I have already sent it to a friend in England.  Highly recommended.

""In Rainbows"" (10 tracks, 43 min.) starts off with ""15 Step"", which for about a minute makes you think you're listening to more of Thom Yorke's brillian solo album ""The Eraser"", but then electric guitar crashes in, reminding you this is the full band. A bone-crushing ""Bodysnatchers"" follows, then giving way to ""Nude"", which is reminiscent of ""How to Disappear Completely"" from Kid A. ""All I Need"" caps off a very strong first half of the album. On the second half, the band turns more introvertly, quieter, check out ""Faust Arp"" with a beautiful acoustic guitar intro. ""Reckoner"" again reminds me of ""The Eraser"" sound. The album ends in a great 1-2 punch, the uptempo ""Jigsaw Falling Into place"" and the piano-driven ballad ""Videotape"".

In all, ""In Rainbows"" is a return to the more traditional (if there is such a thing) Radiohead. Indeed, since the release of ""OK Computer"", the band has taken a number of sideroads: the brilliant experimental ""Kid A"" and its baffling and underwhelming companion album ""Amnesiac"", followed by the unfocused and sprawling ""Hail to the Thief"" have finally lead to ""In Rainbows"". I saw Radiohead headline Bonnaroo in June 2006, where they played several of the ""In Rainbows"" tracks. This album is further proof (to the extent that was still necessary) that Radiohead is one of the most important rock bands out there these days.

I liked them because there was so little spilling when I drank from them, but even though I was diligent about hand-washing them, after a couple of months, one of mine got black stuff growing on the side that I couldn't get out. I thus opted for a couple of the wide-mouthed bottles.

These have many of the benefits of the narrow bottles, including being sturdy and being BPA-free. It pays to be careful when you drink from these, so you don't spill on yourself. These are also easier to clean than the narrow-mouthed bottles, because you can put them in the dishwasher and be reasonably sure that detergent will actually get into them (due to the larger opening). I am hoping that occasional runs through the dishwasher (I use the bottom rack with a no-heat dry option, due to the setup of my dishwasher) in addition to hand washing will keep these from growing stuff!

7499,"After looking at the selection of RFID wallets, I decided on this make and model. I have been unable to find anything wrong with this wallet as outlined in some of the negative reviews. I chose the brown color. The wallet is  made from very thin material and , yes, there is a crinkling sound when the wallet is opened and closed or the bill separator flap is moved. I don't see this to be an issue and just people nit-picking. I've only had the wallet a day or so and it is holding my stuff firmly in place and I don't see anything that would indicate the wallet is fraying or coming apart..., yet.
Now, this wallet is definitely overpriced by about $10-$12 dollars in my estimation. It does feel cheap and I guess the RFID blocking works. I have no easy way to check. I did receive an email asking me to give the wallet a 5 star review for reasons I find unworthy and objectionable.
This is not a 5 star wallet if all factors are considered. I 've had expensive wallets from Italy and this is not in the same class. My review is taking into consideration the price, workmanship and what it is supposed to accomplish with RFID blocking.
In conclusion, the material is thin and the wallet feels cheap and the price is high. On the other hand, I think t was the best pick from the Amazon RFID wallets. I don't expect this wallet to last more than one year at the high end.

This is a fine double mesh.  If it had only one of its fine meshes, it would not work for quinoa.  The two fine meshes are coupled solidly, and that makes it fine enough for quinoa.

It's not all roses though.  The two fine meshes create enough texture to trap some quinoa, which makes clearing these gluten-free seeds a non-instant task.  Some seeds get caught in it and have to be teased out, yet it's worth the effort.

I just haven't been able to listen to Chipmunk music or view them since that  time. I tell you this as a matter of disclosure so you may understand my review better.

My wife likes animated cartoons and we watch them now and then, too often as far as I'm concerned. A few weeks ago, she purchased an ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" DVD. Groan. Of course, we'd have to view it. Well, last night we viewed it. It was interesting in that the movie was filmed in a conventional fashion and then the animated chipmunks were added to the film as if they had been live at the scenes. It's a clever animation technique, without question. The animated Chipmunks therefore appeared to be interacting with the filmed characters. I suppose it must be difficult to get everything synchronized and in perfect order. The directors didn't. In a lot of places, the chipmunk characters were not in the focus of the actors and you could clearly see the actors were performing on their own. I could cite other glitches, but that would probably be considered too picky.

In any case, I suppose I noticed such things because I found the animation rather interesting, but didn't find the movie itself all that interesting. The human acting seemed stiff and unnatural and the actors interfaced with the animated characters only poorly. The story line was weak and uninteresting. Three singing Chipmunks get discovered and work their way to the top of the charts. Yawn. There weren't many substantial laughs unless you like slapstick. In short, the movie was a waste of viewing  time. However, the animated chipmunks themselves were rather well done, if not a little too cutsiepoo.

I'm really burned out on Chipmunk music, especially that Christmas thing. However, some of the new songs in up-to-date styles with dance routines were mildly amusing. That's about it, folks. View it at your own discretion, it's your dime. I can't comprehend how adults could watch this, but I think that small kids (under six) might find it enjoyable. Did I mention that I'm really burned out on Alvin and the Chipmunks?

1631,"I fear many reviewers are missing what is best about Richard Dawkins' The God Delusion.  Some have delighted in telling us it is not the best argument for atheism.  Others lament an occasionally strident tone.  Some are reduced to ad hominem attacks that only reinforce the main point of the author's argument:  the religious are irrational.  I read this marvelous work about atheism with something approaching amazement.

The God Delusion is proof positive of just how sublime a rational, educated mind can be.  It is a work that champions discovery and curiosity. It applauds humanity at its best: when we use the very faculties that distinguish us from other species.  Whether discussing biology and evolution or remarking upon the dazzling possibilities of quantum theory Dawkins is better then interesting.  He is honest, moral and ethical.  It's inspiring.  A living, breathing, thinking example of how much individuals can accomplish when they put their faith in themselves and science.

With humor and pugnacity, intelligence and disdain, Dawkins takes on the God Squad, and doesn't flinch.  Is he always fair? No, but are you?  Is he usually?  Absolutely.  And that's more than most.  It is certainly more than his critics. For me, the most endearing thing about Dawkins is not his intellect (though it's impressive); or his morals (equally admirable).  His ability to make the smug squirm, the certain question and the pompous sputter is magnificent.

Read The God Delusion.  Love it.  Hate it.  But think about it.  Come to your own, independent conclusions. Use the brain that Evolution gave you. That is what Richard Dawkins would encourage you to do.  That is why it is so worthwhile.",3,"[-2.2770796523733234, -3.4402375100282496, -2.2176923378501487, 1.1501790347195593, -2.6624303386639063]",1.1501790347195593

7839,"I've been searching for the Perfect Pillow for years now.  (That's when I take time off from my search for the Perfect Vacuum.)  Degenerative arthritis, one car crash and two bad falls have left me with a neck that's never free from pain and sometimes I wake up in the morning with a headache and worse neck pain than I went to sleep with the night before.

I've tried many pillows.  The best I had found was a $120 Tempurpedic which gives a good amount of support to the neck but doesn't get my head and body into just the right position when sleeping on my side and I still end up with pain even in my shoulder and arm from pressure point issues.

So I went looking here on Amazon and found that this seems to be a pretty well regarded pillow for sufferers of neck pain.  (This is, BTW, the gusseted side sleeper I have purchased, not the contour pillow.)  Well, I've been sleeping on it for more than a week now and already I can tell it's better than the Tempurpedic.  It has good heft and lift to it, like the Tempurpedic, and does a better job of supporting my neck while keeping the head and body in a good position to relieve pressure points when I sleep on my side.  And at the same time it feels less hard and a bit more giving (without sacrificing that important support) for sleeping on.

Pillow heat was never an issue for me so I can't really address the issue of whether this is a cooler pillow than most.  It certainly does not make me feel hot at night, even in Florida summer.  The only minor complaint I have with the pillow is that its gusseted cover is of a relatively stiff material.  I would have preferred it to be a bit softer.  But the support it gives my neck is superb and that's the most important thing.

ETA on 1/21/2015:  I have downgraded somewhat my opinion of this pillow.  Although it is very good for side sleeping, I have found that it doesn't work so well when I want to sleep on my back.  It keeps the back of my head elevated too much.  I prefer for my head to be somewhat cradled and to have more support at the neck when on my back.

Sorry all you johny-come-lates, but this was the Metallica the first generation enjoyed. When you wore your 'Metal Up Your Ass' T-shirt to high school, you were part of a very special and small click. While everyone else had Bon Jovi and Motley Crue, we had Metallica. When I hear this album it saddens me to think of what has happened to one of the truly great and pioneering bands of our time. Thank God I never got that Metallica tatoo.
I can't even pick a high point on this album, if I did I'd have to say (pulling teeth). Hearing Cliff on the bass is a priviledge. I saw them live with Venom on the 'Lightning' tour, and I am telling you all, after his death Metallica should have disbanded like Zepplin.

9631,"While waiting in line to check out today at my local grocery store, I noticed these mechanical pencils among the other back-to-school items on the impulse buy rack. And on impulse, I tossed a pack of them on top of the rest of my stuff on the conveyer belt.

As someone who draws & sketches I like to try out new pencils and pens - and these mechanical pencils with 1.3mm lead looked like they might be worth checking out.

In the package was five of the pencils a refill tube of 12 additional leads, and two replacement erasers. Each of the pencils come with a lead already installed - pulling one out I found that they are 2 3/8"" long (the refills are the same). To reload a pencil, all you have to do is pull off the eraser and drop a new lead into the opening in the top of the pencil. Replace the eraser and click the pencil top about a dozen times or more - till the lead appears at the point of the pencil.

Trying out the pencils - I like the triangular shape of the barrel, it makes it very easy to hold. The thickness of the pencil is nice too - very similar to the big fat pencils that first grades use. I also like to use those for sketching. I have to say the lead holds up well. I applied a bit of pressure to one while drawing and the lead didn't break. The lead itself seems to be a pretty good grade of graphite - makes some nice dark lines.

I really like these pencils - if I had to make a complaint, that would be with the replacement erasers that they give you. Not that there is anything wrong with them, just that being loose like they are - I know I'm going to lose them and never find them when I need one.

So I had best results using a high-walled 12"" skillet.  I also didn't bother with the timing suggestion...I've never set a timer for cooking pasta, and I'm not about to start now.  You'll know when it's done.

The only main nit I had is the attention required here...initially, it's pretty much autopilot, but as the water is either absorbed or evaporated you need to fuss with the pasta a bit more, in particular you need to keep stirring it lest it stick to the bottom of the pan.  Seasoning is also a bit of a challenge...for typical pasta you salt the heck out of the water (really, it should taste like brine), but with this preparation you need to season differently.  I had best results using regular Mortons table salt (not kosher) to season, as the smaller grains dissolved faster and better in the comparatively small amount of water.

7637,"So I recently bought a projector so that my wife and I can watch movies outside on our deck and the thing came with a tiny speaker built in. So when I had the chance to try out this Bose Soundlink I jumped at it. In short it sounds amazing and I recommend it if you are looking to spend $300 on a speaker.

Here's where it shines:
1. Bluetooth: the wife and I have android phones and we were both able to pair our phones to this speaker with little trouble and start playing our music. The music was clear and really sounded pretty amazing.
2. Battery: this thing has an internal battery you charge via the included AC adapter. I am not sure how long the battery is supposed to last, but in my testing I used it for over 5 hours and never had a battery issue.
3. AUX input: the projector I bought doesn't support bluetooth buth this does have an AUX input so I was able to plug in a cable to my projector and then to this speaker and it allowed me to play the audio through it, the movie came to live and this was great as that meant I didn't need a power cable thanks to the internal batteries.

Where it falls short:
1. Cost, While it sounds great at $300 it's on the high end of the cordless bluetooth speakers available today. It is VERY good, but it comes at a premium cost.
2. Protection: This speaker doesn't have any type of protection. Previous generations of this speaker had a cover that was built in. This one does not, although you can buy one from bose for an extra $35. Really? If you are already spending $300 for a speaker the least Bose could do is give you a standard case/cover for it. Because of that I am knocking off one star.

All in all, if you have $300 and like Bose you won't be disappointed with this speaker. It's clear and both music and movies comes to life when played over this speaker regardless if it's via bluetooth or a cable plugged into the AUX input jack. I really like it.",3,"[0.09723392543612297, -2.328694071233441, -1.5698721543037428, 1.1465273176447153, -3.7392703731411503]",1.1465273176447153

If you are only familiar with Toho's Godzilla flicks where the King of The Monsters battles other large monsters with Japan getting destroyed in the process, do yourself a favor and pick up this double disk of Gojira's/Godzilla's debut. There is nothing campy about the original film. Filmed in a greyish-film noir type black and white, the original film is a pretty dark tale conerning the atomic age.

For the first time both the original Japanese film and the American version are packaged together. It's fun to watch them back to back as there are so many edits and changes to Japan's ""Gojira"" that the American ""Godzilla"" plays like a completely different film. Unlike some of the reveiwers here, I really do like the American verison with Raymond Burr. If nothing else, it really shows how clever the studio was in inserting Burr into the film, editing dialog and scenes pretty flawlessly into the original film.

Low and behold, as by chance, each gets to deliver 9 tracks to the album, which at 76 min. truly is 2 solo albums collated together, albeit with the great backing of John McVie on bass and Mick Fleetwood on drums. I can only imagine the tension of sequencing the tracks: after Lindsay gets the first 2 tracks, Stevie prob said, if I don't get the next one, I'm walking. So track 3 ""Illume"" is a Stevie track, as is track 4! And so on.

I tend to use mostly cast iron and one very well seasoned circulon pan, but there are some jobs that just want a non-stick pan, and these work very well. They have nice grippy soft coated handle, and they're light enough to make all three sizes very easy to toss. They have a nice balance and a good hand. They're very easy to clean-- a quick rinse and wipe for most; or a quickq swipe with a nonstick scrubber for stickier remains. I do agree with the other reviewers who recommend keeping the heat at medium or below.

The color goes beautifully with Le Cueuset flame, and looks pretty with all the Le Creuset colors is you have an assortment. The set is on the smaller end of practical (the medium is the smallest size I would normally buy, and I'd call the largest a good everyday size for two. They might be a bit small for a family, but they're very adequate for cooking for 1-3.

7773,"This review is for the ""original"" flavor.  These came in the February Love with Food (a subscription box I pay for each month).

First off, if you don't like other seaweed snacks, stay away from these.  The seaweed snack flavor is there and it is strong.  But, if you're like me, you've eaten seaweed snacks and thought they were all right, but maybe were left thinking they were lacking in substance (those strips are THIN and lightweight).  These offer a solution to that problem.  They are a layer of seaweed snack attached to something like a rice cracker.  The cracker part gives substance where the seaweed alone wouldn't have it, and the flavors are complementary.

You can see the full nutrition facts panel and ingredients list if you zoom in on the image of the back of the package.  The first ingredient in these is tapioca starch and they thus have 14 grams of processed starch in an 18 gram serving.  Other nutritionals are not particularly interesting; as you might expect, there's some sodium (190 mg, or about 8% if you are on a 2000 calorie diet).  These are basically empty calories, but in fairness, one serving is only 80 calories, which is on the low side.  (As an aside, the package is not resealable, which is a little irritating since there are two servings in a single package.)

The texture of these is quite nice and because of the added rice cracker part, you do feel like you are getting a substantial snack (unlike with plain seaweed strips).  The flavor is complex but definitely in the range of what you will expect from a seaweed snack.  (Random bit of information: don't eat these when you have a horrible cold and lots of congestion, as they just taste fishy then, even though there is no fish in them.  Learn from my mistake.)

I am trying to eat more green things and I know seaweed has lots of nutrients like iodine and other minerals that may not show up on the nutrition label because they're not mandated to be there, and I did enjoy eating these.  As part of an overall balanced diet with lots of fiber and such, these snacks should be just fine for most people to consume fairly regularly.",3,"[-2.548401959085351, -1.4299399549221152, -1.4551758763812868, 1.1427285691116322, -3.8809577982703507]",1.1427285691116322

5517,"Mesu Andrews in her new book, Miriam Book Two in the Treasures of the Nile series published by WaterBrook Press brings us into the life of the sister of Moses.

From the Back Cover:  The Hebrews call me prophetess, the Egyptians a seer.
But I am neither. I am simply a watcher of Israel
and the messenger of El Shaddai.
When He speaks to me in dreams, I interpret. When He whispers a melody, I sing.

At eighty-six, Miriam had devoted her entire life to loving El Shaddai and serving His people as both midwife and messenger. Yet when her brother Moses returns to Egypt from exile, he brings a disruptive message. God has a new name  Yahweh  and has declared a radical deliverance for the Israelites.

Miriam and her beloved family face an impossible choice: cling to familiar bondage or embrace uncharted freedom at an unimaginable cost. Even if the Hebrews survive the plagues set to turn the Nile to blood and unleash a maelstrom of frogs and locusts, can they weather the resulting fury of the Pharaoh?

Enter an exotic land where a cruel Pharaoh reigns, pagan priests wield black arts, and the Israelites cry out to a God they only think they know.

Its time to go back to Egypt. Feel the hot, burning sun, have the rough sand under your feet. What the Israelites wear is way different from what the Egyptians wear. And just when you start to feel oppressed by the Egyptians as well Moses returns. But the story of the ten plagues is told through Miriam, the sister of Moses. Not only do we get the story as it unfolds we also get the sense of frustration that Miriam had for her older brother. I have never read a book where Moses is family. I have to admit this was quite interesting.  Ms. Andrews has done a superb account of researching many different sources to give us Miriam and a cast of characters that most of us are probably not aware of. This is a well done adventure that will keep you flipping pages looking for what happens next.

4244,"The Most Wonderful Tine of the Year is an enjoyable Christmas devotional to follow during the holiday season.  Starting from December 1 to December 31, this book includes a short devotional, history, lyrics and meaning behind popular Christmas songs, and a holiday craft corresponding to each date.  The beginning of each devotional includes a bible verse which is loosely related to the devotional.  While I like how Collins is trying to pack in as much historical facts regarding television shows, Christmas traditions, and random individuals, I felt that these random facts took away from the heart of the devotional and from the bible verse included.  It's almost as if the bible verse was merely put there as an extra, and that Jesus was put in the back seat in comparison to the random Perry Como fact noted in the devotional.

The song lyrics/meaning section was interesting to me, and I found myself looking up the song online to hear it.  While this was nice to have in the book, I felt it was mostly filler.  As for the recipes and gifts, these are only okay.  The majority of the gifts were body scrubs and desserts based off of cake batter mixes, premade cookies/desserts, and frozen pie crusts.  There were a couple of recipes that were truly homemade and actually not bad, but none of the recipes were anything worth making multiple times.

Overall, this book isn't terrible, but I think I would rather purchase individual books for each section - ie, a purely Christmas devotional, a Christmas song book, and a really good Christmas craft/recipe book.

When I received it I worried it was too small. When I saw the box I thought, ""Oh, it is really tiny"". However, it is perfect! I washed it and then filled it up with about 3  cups water. I can't seem to get more water in the teapot without it being full. I use the diffuser on tea that is even in bags so it steeps longer.

Quality wise this is made very well! I am somewhat picky and could not find one blemish on the pot. Style wise it is very modern and fits in well with any d&eacute;cor or china patterns.

I have used it in the microwave and just place it in for 3 minutes and 30 seconds. It states it is dishwasher safe on here but did not see it written on the box or the product so wash it by hand which is no biggie since I find myself using it daily anyway.

If you are looking for a cute little teapot for yourself, I don't think you would be disappointed with this one. It more than met my expectations.

So as I was so pleased with the color quality and crisp picture on my current Dell monitor I selected this for its replacement as it has a VESA mounting compatibility so it can be either wall mounted or put onto an arm. Itl lists its features as Full HD quality @multiple angles w/ VESA-mount compatibility & tilt options, along with VGA & HDMI ports.

This is exactly what I needed and the picture is as crisp as the ST2421L monitor that it is replacing. It also has the PowerNap tech that dims the screen's brightness or puts the monitor in sleep mode when it isn't being used.

It also comes with the same Dell 3 year warranty as my other Dell monitor has. I have seven kids and a LOT of their monitors throughout the years have been Dell, and only once did we ever have to file a warranty claim That one time when we had a monitor totally fail they promptly replaced it. I have read that others have had issues with non computer Dell items when having a problem, I don't know what we did differently but we had  no issue with the claim process whatsoever that is why we continue to buy their monitors most of the time. That said, I will gladly  ""jump ship"" for an awesome Black Friday or Cyber Monday deal though!!  ;-)

9777,"I don't know whether this is healthier for the cat or the planet than regular clay litter, but I'm not a big fan. This product consists of pellets that are about the size of the pellets one buys to feed a guinea pig (or, actually, a bit larger). These pellets are too large for the scoop I use to remove cat feces, and the result is that in scooping out the litter box, I removed not just the feces but a fair amount of the litter. I did not notice any particular clumping ability to speak of. The pellets do expand when wet, and there was some tendency to clump, but not in the way that other litters do. (With other clumping litters, when a cat urinates, you get a reasonably solid ball of litter that scoops out easily. That's not the case here. The only real clumping I found was when I emptied a litter box and found that a clump of the pellets was stuck to the bottom--though it came off when I hit the bottom of the box.)

My biggest problem is that this litter seems to be messier than standard clay litter. My cats (several) made an absolute mess around the box despite the high sides. Some of the mess was pellets that escaped, became wet, and were not so much fun to clean up. Some of the mess was urine, a problem I had not had with clay.

The litter worked reasonably well for its purpose and did do a fairly good job of killing odors, but there were drawbacks to be sure.",3,"[-1.9758713050605459, -2.362573987394704, -1.951506636714761, 1.1309848753882885, -3.532575294187775]",1.1309848753882885

Here's why...  a good juicer grinds up what is put into it and separates the juice from the pulp from a combination of centripetal force and straining.  A good juicer will leave the pulp damp, but 90% or more of the juice goes into the glass.  This unit leaves more than 20% of the juice in the pulp... so you're not only losing money on your produce that is wasted, but it is also a MESS to clean.

My parents gave me an olympia unit that is 15 years old, and of an ""old school"" design and it works better than my brand new black and decker unit.  I also know that particular model cost around $350 back when they bought it 15 years ago... but that may also be due to the fact that juicing was not as popular back then.

I have read that you want a unit that is at least 450watts... but that is silly.  Being less energy efficient is hardly a measure of quality.  I would recommend to the would be juicer to do your homework before buying a new unit and find out which ones (a) are juice efficient (less wasteful), and (b) easy to clean.  Other than that, they all make juice the same way (more or less).  If you can pay twice as much but get a juicer that is 10x better, it is worth the extra cost.

If you want to start juicing and absolutely cannot afford to spend more money on a unit then this one will get the job done until you can afford a better one.  For our family it is going to be the ""back up"" unit.

However, I've never found any that let me carry on a conversation and listen to my mobile device while protecting my ears.  Until now.  I've tested every function on the Peltor 500, and it excels at them all.

To test the noise suppression, I shot a 44 magnum (extra hot hand loads).  It kept the sound level to a very comfortable volume, but at the same time, I was able to hear nearby conversation.  The person to whom I was talking didn't have to raise her voice, and I could hear her perfectly.  This also works well as a headset for my mobile phone.  It connected easily via Bluetooth, and the voice quality on both ends of the phone call were great.  I was also able to listen to the music on my phone through the headset.  There is a voice that tells me when this headset turns on or off, plus when it's connected to a Bluetooth device.  It comes with a nice drawstring storage bag.  The phone requires 2 AA batteries (not included).  You can also buy an optional lithium ion rechargeable battery (Alpha 1100).  Peltor includes a cord that is compatible with 3.5 mm audio input jack on most mobile devices or 2-way radios.

It was easy to set up the various features:

* Adaptive Suppression Time: Measures gunshot energy and adapts to various calibers;

* Surround Sound Filtering: Improves the ability to hear nearby speech;

* Auto Power Off: Set to automatically turn off after 2 or 4 hours to save battery power;

* Bluetooth: Connects to any compatible device (I tested this on my ZTE Axon 7 phone);

* Dosimeter ON/Limiter ON: Dosimeter ON allows increase audio inputs, yet corrects to maintain a safe volume over a 24-hour perios; Limiter ON sets the audio input to a maximum of 82 db(A).

The mattress becomes compressed when stored but pops back in to shape within just a few minutes; time to make the bed with sheets/blankets.

-First measure your mattress platform to see what size your mattress needs to be.
-Take a marker & a straight edge & mark your cutting line on the mattress.
-Place a piece of plywood under the mattress marker cutting line so that you don't damage your floor when cutting.
-Take an electric kitchen knife or a large sharp knife & score along the marked line.
-Go over the cut line using a sawing motion until you have cut all the way through.

The next problem occurred when my wife discovered a burning rubber odor, which failed to go away after multiple uses.

The third issue was the fact that the slow cooker was never capable of fully cooking the food placed in it. My wife cooked chicken breasts, but after the suggested time was reached, the chicken pieces were still raw in the middle.

7769,"Matcha powder is one of those things I discovered recently and now I always try to keep some of it around. I use it in baking and smoothies to add a little extra nutrient boost (green tea has amazing antioxidant properties, and you get so much more benefit from it by eating it rather than just drinking it). Please note: this is a culinary grade matcha, not a ceremonial grade matcha, which is why it's less expensive than some of the other matchas out there. It's still got all the health benefits you'd expect, and it's still a pretty green color, but it's not what you would get if you paid two or three times as much. So just keep that in mind.

I tried this in some muffins over the weekend and was quite happy with the results. I put it in lemon poppyseed muffins, just added two tablespoons of matcha to my regular recipe. The muffins did end up with a pea green color and a slight tea flavor, but it worked really well. In general, matcha pairs well with lemon in baked recipes.

I also like to put matcha in my smoothies to add an antioxidant boost (along with cacao powder). I don't necessarily see or taste it there, because my recipe is pretty complex, but I can dump a fair amount of it in without the smoothie feeling gritty. (If you don't want to drink green tea, but want the health benefits of matcha, a smoothie is a great way to get matcha in concentrated form.)

I have tried three or four different matchas this year and they are all good. This one is comparable to the others and is a good value, as well.

However, these jeans fit just right and I love the fit. As I mentioned, they are stretchy and that's always a plus in my book. They are your average black, 5-pocket jeans (they call it luxury denim) with a straight leg and not so straight bottoms that flair out a little. They zip up with a button and if you ask me, they have a case of tag overload. I've counted 6 tags.

One con for me as far as these jeans are concerned is that they catch a lot of lint. When I took them out of the bag, they had a considerable amount of lint, and since I've worn them, even more. My suggestion is to keep a lint roller handy, because you're going to need it. I don't have any pets right now, but I am sure that if you have a cat or a dog, your pants are going to show that.

9654,"A couple years ago, we needed a new hose and my wife wanted a reel to go with It. I didn't want the reel. We compromised and got this 50-foot Spring Hose at our local home warehouse store.

This garden hose has not been a good buy and I would hesitate to recommend it except for special circumstances. First of all, It looks like a good idea, but it's very hard to use. It might be 50 foot, but we have difficulty stretching it out more than 25 feet from the spout. If we attach a sprinkler to it, the sprinkler gradually creeps back toward the spout because of the coils. Plus, the coils are very easy to get all entangled and hard to untangle. It's a very awkward apparatus and hard to manage anywhere in the yard.

One time I turned the water off at the hose nozzle. That was a mistake. Our water pressure then produced an aneurism in the hose and it finally popped. Time for a hose repair kit. Then my wife did the same thing and it responded in the same manner elsewhere on the hose. This time our neighbor had to come over and turn it off because we were not home. Now it's starting to crack in a third place. I'll now be glad to get rid of it. Think twice before purchasing this hose.

The set up for the ROKU was relatively easy, once I placed the ROKU directly in line with the router. However, I did have to go through the set up more than once. Issues that were problems involved synching the remote to the ROKU along with the ROKU having difficulty connecting to my network. Once these items were resolved, I thought it would be clear sailing, until I tried to download my first movie.

That's when I spent what felt like an eternity waiting for the movie to download, and when it began, it was constantly interrupted with the loading message.

Since my Internet connection tests well above the required speed, and since my laptop, using the same router signal does not experience the same problems, I can only assume that the problem exists between the router and the ROKU, especially with the original set up issues.

To test my theory, I connected the ROKU using the ethernet cable, and immediately everything sped up 100%.

Now that it is hard wired, all is well, including speed. As a result, I am particularly grateful for this version which permits the Ethernet connection.

We have about four places in the house where we're always looking for plug-in space so we got a couple 6-plug outlet adapters. The first we tried simply plugged into the existing wall 2-plug outlet and fitted on top of the existing wall plate. They worked all right, but when you tried to pull out some hard-to-pull plugs the wall 6-plug outlet adapter itself would come out of the wall. This just wouldn't do. Next we picked up a couple of these 6-plug adapters that required the removal of the original wall plate. Then the adapter was plugged into the 2-plug wall outlet (sans wall plate) and was screwed into the wall socket as was the original wall plate. This worked much better and we've had no trouble with it since that time.

Now several of our rooms have adequate outlets and we're considering adding several more of these 6-plug adapters in a couple other rooms. Real handy devices! If you use these six-plug adapters, keep in mind that the amperage of the outlet itself is not increased to compensate for the extra plug-in spaces. Be careful that you don't plug too many heavy-duty appliances into the one outlet or you may trip the circuit breaker. The six-plug outlet will take a full load of lights, radios, small fans and things of that sort without any problem. If I plug a vacuum cleaner in, or something like that, I just make certain that other heavy duty things are turned off at the time.

Obviously it is much less expensive than the Keurig brand itself, but seems to do the same job and have the same specifications as the Keurig Mini Brewer. I am planning to purchase the reusable k-cup

Pros:
 Cost

 Size - fits perfectly on my small apartment counter

Ease of use - Quickly brews a cup of coffee.-- (Someone mentioned putting this on  before going into the shower in the morning; I would never do that because the  coffee would be cold.

Clean up-- no stained carafe to deal with, no basket that needs scrubbing within the grooves to get it clean

Variety of flavors available

Cons -
temperature - I add half and half or milk to my coffee and it cools off rather quickly

Brew strength - I like my coffee weaker than most but I have solved that by brewing two cups using the same k-cup and combining them.

I checked out the more expensive Keurig brewers and this was hands down the best for the money.  I would have liked some of the additional features (like being able to have larger cup sizes for iced beverages) but I can transfer the coffee to a large glass.

I would strongly recommend picking up one of the variety packs of K-cups offered by Amazon so that you can decide which flavors you really like the best; you can't really tell from the name of the flavor.

UPDATE: July 24, 2012 -  Now that the newness has worn off I still love this coffee maker and wouldn't consider going back to the old brew method.

Most of my masking was on smooth surfaces (window frames, baseboards; not on the walls themselves), so the texture problem was not an issue for me.

I do recommend doing your best not to slop too much paint around the tape, or to wipe up excess drips from the tape while wet, as the thicker the paint, the more likely it is to stick to the tape and lift off, particularly with latex paint.

5494,"Dr. Neal Barnard's Program for Reversing Diabetes:
The Scientifically Proven System for Reversing Diabetes
Without Drugs by Dr. Neal Barnard is an excellent primer
on the causes of diabetes and strategies to control the
condition. Dr. Barnard notes that diabetes has been rare
in places like China and Japan.

The author's research suggests that Type I Diabetes could be reduced
by avoiding early childhood exposure to cow's milk. In addition,
fatty foods and refined sugar are dietary taboos. Excess fat is bad
because it interferes with how muscles function.

According to the author, the best strategy is to avoid animal
products, reduce the consumption of vegetable oils and reduce
the glycemic index (GI)with more healthful food choices.

The GI ranks foods on how the level of blood glucose is impacted. This index measures the increments in blood glucose within two or more hours subsequent to consuming food.

The GI is most sensitive to foods high in carbohydrates. Foods high in protein or fat don't cause the blood glucose to increase to a level that would concern physicians as much.

Eliminating animal fat makes the blood less viscous and more watery. As a result, blood flow is easier and sediment decreases. In addition, fat cells interfere with insulin action. For instance, the author shows how beef has 37 fat calories; whereas, beans have four fat calories.

There are better dietary choices for children. The book cites examples like
oatmeal, cantaloupe, and whole grains with no grease. Eggs may be replaced with egg powder, tofu, or mashed banana. Cooking spray may be used in place of poured oil. Greens and beans have large amounts of natural calcium. Plain water is preferred over sugary soda with upwards of 30 grams of sugar in a single can.

The author presents many sample recipes. In addition, there is an extensive set of references from authoritative citations like the Journal of the American Dietetic Association, Clinical Therapeutics, Preventive Medicine Pediatrics and The European Journal of Clinical Nutrition.

Dr. Neal Barnard's Program for Reversing Diabetes is excellent for implementing important dietary changes to manage insulin sensitivity intelligently.

2046,"I just read three books one after another about Esther, a total of one thousand forty-two pages.  Esther: Royal Beauty by Angela Hunt, Esther the Queen by H B. Moore, and Esther by Rebecca Kanner.
Each book obviously worked toward the same ending and had many of the same characters.  Xerxes of course and Vishta the deposed queen (so called by name in two of the books) along with various eunuchs and servants, Mordecai who raised Esther and Haman the Agagite, evil and treacherous.  Two of the books gave some accounting of the Battle at Thermopylae and then against the Greek armies, and though that was Xerxess headache it certainly had an impact of Esther.  Hadassah was a Jew born of modest means, orphaned shortly after her birth and then raised by Mordecai and the name Esther was given to her by the Persians, the name meaning star in the Persian language or possibly in reference to Ishtar, a Goddess.  Each book tells a different version of how she came to be at the royal palace and there is variation as to her passage of time there prior to becoming the chosen Queen and wife of Xerxes, no doubt each author expressing their literary liberties.  Much of the dialog is very similar, almost verbatim, perhaps some bit of recorded history.  Each book gives colorful descriptions of the opulence of royalty without discussion of the lack of todays modern comforts, heat, running water, electricity, air conditioning and so on and so forth.  It is widely acknowledged that Esther saved the Jews from certain extermination.  She is portrayed as all that is good about a person, and this in a land where even today women are treated less equal than a pet.

The nice thing is that it spins at 17,000 RPM vs. the 10,000 RPM of my Makita angle grinder.  Since this Dremel has more speed, it takes just a light touch to cut through tough materials.

As another reviewer pointed out, I wonder why Dremel chose to make the guard out of plastic that could melt from sparks, rather than metal (so I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because of this plastic design).",3,"[-1.7393506997577228, -3.7505277644628, -2.0416268915189497, 1.1002623913178016, -2.908907421128824]",1.1002623913178016

9847,"Below is my initial review.  This review is as of June 20, 2014.  Initially, I found the stakes pounded into the grassy area of our yard held well, but where the area was sandy, they did not hold at all.  However, they were so handy to use and held well enough to deserve a 3 star rating.

Now new problems have arisen.  We use these stakes to hold guy wires steading an open 10' x 10' open canopy over an outdoor hot tub.  I had sufficient locations available to manage to get all four corners tied and stabilized using the groundhog stakes...areas that were grassy with clay soil.  Over the past few days we have had a great deal of rain and wind.  The rain saturated the soil and wet the clay so that it was no longer the hard, cement-like soil it becomes in the summer.  All the Grounhog stakes pulled out of the ground and had to be replaced with either twist-type stakes or the ordinary yellow plastic stakes that are common with tents.  Even the cheaper plastic stakes (cheaper than Grounghog) hold better in our case.  The Groundhogs are so thin that it takes very little to wiggle them loose with softer soil no matter what angle they are placed in the ground.  These seemed like a great idea at first, but for a use such as ours, where a structure is more or less semi-permanent, they are not suitable.  For a day or two of tenting, they would be fine, I guess, but that is all I could recommend they be used for.

OLD, INITIAL 3 STAR REVIEW:
If the soil you intend these stakes to hold your tent or other items securely in the ground is soft or sandy they will disappoint you, I believe.  We used them to stake a canopy that covers of hot tub in the backyard of our home.  The stakes that went into the grassy area worked well and held firmly.  But, those that went into the area near the patio which has no grass and is made up of flagstone simply pulled right out of the ground as they were pounded in.  They were not under any stress from wind or weather, simply trying to tie a line to them and pull it taut caused them to come right back out.

We went back to the stakes that you twist into the ground and they hold extremely well.  They are so hard to install I was hoping these new ones would help, but no such luck.",3,"[-2.1068446347854337, -2.3689132836582134, -1.8533685727576197, 1.0984190459845407, -3.0432692710042497]",1.0984190459845407
1633,"Buy this book if you would like to read a book that clearly puts forward the atheist world view with out the emotionalism or anger that usually accompanies atheist authors. Mr. Dawkins acknowledges that even though no one can be 100% sure whether God exists, a reasonable person that is equipped with biblical knowledge and a fundamental knowledge of science can believe with almost certainity that there is no God, and if such a being exists the Deity is certainly not the Judeo-Christian God of the Bible and Church history. Mr. Dawkins leaves no stone unturned, he boldly explains why the bible is not the word of God from the errors of Jesus's geneology in Matthew and Luke (The number of generations vary by over 13 in his lineage from David), also he explains how you would be hard pressed to find a more petty God than the one that exists in the Old Testament.
Mr. Dawkins also does an excellent job in explaining that evolution does not claim chance created all evolved life. Natural selection is the mechanism that causes DNA to adapt and survive to changing environments. The big point is that saying God created life in its complex forms does not solve the origin of life, it simply moves it to God, who created God?
 The author believes that religion is a very dangerous delusion perpetrated on children at young ages. It is a form of brain washing that has no place in our modern world. The point of the book is that the glory of the universe and the mystery of science is adequate to fill the void that is left from the burden of religion.
 This book is the best one I have found on the market for a clear logical, rational presentaion of atheism. A must read for all serious students of truth, science, and religion. It may free you from a burden you were not aware you carried. Or it will make you a more thoughtful and well spoken atheist.

1929,"The subtitle is misleading in that it says, ""Discovering God Amidst the Rwandan Holocaust,"" when, in fact, author Immaculee Ilibagiza never waivers in her devout Catholic beliefs. The important facts of the story are that the author, a smart, overachieving, ethnic Tutsi college student survived the approximately 100 day long 1994 massacre in Rwanda of close to a million Tutsis at the hands of the Hutus by hiding in a neighbor's small bathroom with six other females. In the case of her four family members who were killed (the surviving brother having been away from the area at the time), the murderers were their former neighbors and friends, who, because of her strong religious beliefs, she was able to forgive. The Tutsis and Hutus had a long history of distrust and discrimination before the incident that sparked the massacre. The Rwandan president, a Hutu, died when his plane was shot down on April 6, 1994, after which the Hutus decided to rid themselves of, they believed, the ethnically inferior Tutsis, which comprised 14 percent of the population to their 85 percent (the remaining one percent being of the Twas). Although the horror and injustice that she, her family and a million other Tutsis suffered is as bad as it gets, her book reads more like chronological journal entries of a college-aged Christian, than the memoir it professes to be. Although it is an easy read, those whose beliefs don't mirror her own, may wonder at times if they are reading a devotional, since about 20 percent of the book is filled with the actual prayers she employed in an attempt to ensure both her safety and survival and that of her family members.

3115,"""Reign: The Chronicles of Queen Jezebel"" is fictional, based on the biblical story of Queen Jezebel and King Ahab, betrothed as a union between two nations. Jezebel was the daughter of King Eth-Baal who reigned in Phoenicia where the practice of worshiping gods and goddesses demanded the sacrifice of infants and children. Ahab was the son of King Omri of Israel, the land of Yahweh, a land of armies. Obadiah is a servant to Ahab, and serves as his administrator. His role in this story is one whose advice to Ahab is unheeded, and he is too timid to command respect. His relationship with the prophet Elijah is valuable, but his lacking strength of character fails him and his allegiance to Ahab.

Jezebel, unloved and neglected as a child, became a vicious woman, scorned by all, including her husband. Ahab was not a born leader, and as he ignored Yahweh's warnings Israel suffered great tragedies. Jezebel's wickedness and mean spirit only brought hatred and disrespect. Her beauty was her only attribute. Her hateful spirit positions her husband against her, although he had previously loved her.

This fictional tale of the lives of Jezebel, Ahab and Obadiah is an emotional sojourn. The author researched her biblical history well. There were a few slow passages, but the story was well told and interesting beyond what I expected. I was compelled to get my bible out to read the biblical account of this profound story. For those interested in an enhancement of Jezebel's character and influence, this is an excellent portrayal.

The inclusion of sunflower petals is something I haven't seen before; I didn't even realize they were edible.  But, I've had other flower petals in teas before, so why not?

The lack of an Oxford comma on the can in the ingredients list is a bit confusing, but I think what is meant is that the passion fruit, papaya, and pineapple are all present as flavorings (as opposed to little bits of fruit).  I'm OK with this, because a lot of times, when I've had teas with actual fruit bits, not a lot of fruit flavor actually comes out.  Flavorings usually actually work a little better, in this regard.

If you don't want to dip your fingers into your tea to remove the bag, you'll need some tongs or a spoon.  I find that the fruit smell develops a bit more, the longer you steep it.  The same is true for the fruit flavor, although the fruit flavor is subtle.  I usually drink this plain, strong, and hot, but this is one of those rare teas that will work hot or iced and will work with or without milk/cream and/or the sweetener of your choice.  So it's pretty versatile.

I tend to forget to remove the tea bag and I find that this doesn't get too bitter for me, even with a long brewing time.  Also, for what it's worth, I bought this years ago, but the canister got buried at the back of my cabinet and I forgot about it.  Several years later, and the tea is still pretty good.  So, even opened, this has a long shelf life.  (Once I found it again, though, I've been drinking a couple of cups of this per day.  I'll be out of it in no time.)",3,"[-1.6506084814842963, -1.8020192956818164, -1.8012746930007737, 1.0902517578067352, -2.986356705352291]",1.0902517578067352

9680,"Even though I already have some insect problems in the vegetable garden, I haven't used this there.
After doing a little research on the active ingredient, I learned that it can be harmful to bees.
Someone in our area must have taken up beekeeping a few years ago and I maintain several bee blocks for solitary bees.
We have quite a few toads in the garden, on the patio and other spots that consume a lot of insects.

We also have backyard chickens for the first time this year and I don't want to risk harming my chickens if I toss them a tomato hornworm or cutworm from the garden.  The squirrels steal all of the fruit from our fruit trees long before they are full size or mature, so I don't bother spraying them since we rarely get anything from them.

So after giving it some thought, I used this to spray around all of our windows and window ledges outside.  I sprayed the cracks in our driveway and on our patio.  I did apply it to our roses and other container plants in the front of the house, but chose not to apply it to anything in the vegetable garden.  When I need to deal with insect problems in the vegetable garden, I prefer to use products like neem oil, sal suds, BT or just a soap spray.  I don't want to cause any harm to the many bees that work so hard to pollinate everything in our yard.

From what I've read about the active ingredient, it doesn't appear to pose any substantial health risk to humans and breaks down fairly fast, but I prefer to use caution rather than chemicals on products we will consume and not risk harming beneficial insects.

We really liked the dispenser and wand that uses standard batteries.

for hot spots. But, I'll share a few things, and update when we've tried it longer.
(Note that we received a bottle with a different design. Hope ours was the new one
and not the old one!)

First off, this has a photo of both a cat and dog on the label. So, you could assume that
this is for both types of pets. I am not entirely sure of that now.
When I saw the word ""spray"", I had assumed it would be a mist that would easily
cover an area on an animal. It isn't. It is a sloppy wet spray that drips easily.
It took a long time to dry off of a comforter that we had placed the cat on to spray him.
(He has a hot spot he keeps going after, even tho he is worm/flea free.)

Secondly, this has propylene glycol in it. I am NOT happy about that. That is an ingredient
often used in making anti-freeze and other car fluids. It isn't something I wanted to see
in my pets' products.

This might work well for dogs who do not normally lick themselves a lot, esp on their backs.
For our cat, this is going to be tricky. We didn't restrain our cat, since I thought it was
just hydrocortisone and aloe. But, we later found out that it was much more.
Not sure what kind of damage that this might do when cats lick for grooming, and will ingest
much more of the product than a dog would. It would be possible to put some sort of collar on
our cat, I suppose, but I didn't want to do that.

So, not happy with the product at all at this point.
Good for dogs, bad for cats.

.

California Kitchenware Silicone Cupcake Baking Molds

Twelve multicolor CKW signature cups are made to be used in the oven up to 500 degrees F, but can also be used in the freezer or microwave. The food-grade, non-stick silicone is fun for kids but uncompromising in performance.

The 2x3x1-1/2 cups fit in the spaces of standard metal or glass muffin pans, or they can be placed individually on a flat cookie sheet or jelly-roll pan. CKW Butterfield cupcake molds can be used to bake breakfast muffins, birthday cupcakes, cheesecakes, individual brownies, and more. The flexible cups ensure easy removal of baked goods or molded gelatins.

California baking molds
Yes  I am a messy muffin maker

Stackable for storage, the set of 12 baking cups can be cleaned by hand or in the top rack of the dishwasher. I LOVE how easy to clean and use these cupcake molds were. Gone are the days when I had to buy paper cups all the time.

These are perfect for all my upcoming events  and NOTHING sticks to them  which makes me happier than anything.

- display diagnostic codes
- erase ALL codes
- retrieve I/M readiness status
- display the VIN number on 2002 or newer vehicles
- rescan

The MS300 supports the OBD II or OBD2 (On-Board-Diagnostics II) system and it understands all OBD2 protocols that a car may use: PWM, VPW, KWP2000, ISO9041, EKWP2000 or CAN. Once the proper protocol is detected, the MS300 is ready to display whatever Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTC) the car computer's memory may be holding.

It should be noted that:

# it only retrieves codes already stored in the computer
# it does NOT provide any 'real-time' monitoring
# it is completely stand-alone and no Web-updates are possible
# it does not have printing capabilities
# it is powered through the car's own DLC (Data Link Connector)

The manual while not completely accurate does offer sufficient information to successfully connect and operate the device. It also includes a printed list of over 1000 generic Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTC) definitions. 8000 more manufacturer specific DTCs can be found on the CD with more information at the company's own Web site.

In my case, I was able to diagnose within minutes the source for the 'Service Engine Soon' warning on my dashboard:

P0442 - EVAP Emission Control System Leak (Small)

I erased the codes and, if the warning reappears, I will know EXACTLY what to tell the technicians.

Given that I purchased this during one of Amazon's lightning deals, the price was right and I feel that I am getting a lot of value out of this little tool. The manual's small shortcomings do not compel me to subtract a star so, it's a 5-star device for me. I am happy I ordered it.

I hadn't seen ""Live at Pompeii"" in many, many years. I didn't even know that a new ""Director's Cut"" had been released, so I was quite intruiged by this.

""Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii"" (171 min.) starts off with the ""Director's Cut"" (91 min; in 16:9 widescreen). I was a little surprised to see all the additional space footage, I mean how weird is it to see International Space Station footage from (I'm guessing) the 1990s in a concert film that was filmed in late 71/early 72! I also couldn't quite understand the logic behind adding footage (not concert footage, even) from the band messing around at Abbey Studios on various ""Dark Side of the Moon"" material. All rather strange. The original film (60 min; in 4:3 full screen) is also included, thankfully. While I prefer watching the widescreen ""refit"", the original shorter movie makes a lot more sense musically and thematically. ""Echoes Part I"" and ""Echoes Part II"" bookend the fantastic Pompeii-filmed set.

Am I the only one to think that as it relates to the Pompeii-filmed footage, Nick Mason had an inordinate amount of screen time? I'm thinking as much as the other three combined. You can't as much as catch a glimpse of Roger Waters until well into ""Echoes Part I"" for some reason. The DVD contains a 15-20 min. interview with the director Adrian Maben, and it's interesting hearing him talk about the intent of making this the ""anti-Woodstock"" film, with no spectators instead of the ""million"" at Woodstock.

One of my dogs has had diarrhea for the three days we've been adding these to their regular food. Every one else is fine though. I took one of the pods to our vet and we think the sweet potatoes are just not agreeing with Traveler - there isn't anything else that jumps out at us as particularly problematic.

The Takeya Cold Brew Coffee Maker is a fantastic thing to have when brewing up some cold coffee.

The next day, you'll coffee concentrate that you can use in hot or cold coffee drinks.  The coffee concentrate should last about 2 weeks in the fridge, although we finish it well before that times comes.

One thing to note is that you should definitely be careful when grinding your coffee for this filter.  I like grinding whole bean coffee and if you grind it too fine, the grinds will go through the filter.  I give it a rough ground and it seems to stay in place just fine.

The top of the machine was just a touch difficult to close with these in there, but I have found that to be true for all reusable filters (have tried three different kinds in the past month), so that is not really a problem specific to these.

This helps remove almost all of the sludge that sometimes you get at the bottom of you coffee cup.

Back to the Thermos: Depeding on how full the thermos is it will keep the coffee really hot for 6 to 8 hours. After that, it sometimes needs to me microwaved for 30 to 40 seconds to be hot enough. This, of course deteriorates the flavor. So, the key is to not make more coffee than you'll consume in more than 6 or 7 hours.

9816,"UPDATE: I called into Turbo Tax priority phone support today (phone number is 800-624-9066) for some tax advice and to verify that I was dealing with a tax situation correctly. There was about a 10 minute wait, then a transfer with another 5 minute wait. I was able to speak to a CPA who immediately understood my tax situation and questions and helped me navigate the software quickly to answer my questions. Having this priority phone support saved me hours of searching the web and actually gave me an answer from someone who knows taxes and knows TurboTax. I had never used phone support in the past as there had always been surcharges. It is so nice and comforting to talk to an actual person with tax knowledge far deeper than mine who was polite and incredibly proficient at phone support.

I've been a long-time (10+ years) user of TurboTax. Just as in years past, importing previous year's data was seamless. Please be aware that if you need Schedule D you will need Premier this year (where Deluxe may have worked in the past). I have used TurboTax to prepare and file my Federal and State taxes with multiple different tax situations (from simple W2 few investments to multiple 1099's and lots of investments).I appreciate the familiarity and simplicity of the interface and the seamlessness of year to year. Carryovers just carryover. TurboTax remembers my deductions, income, and situation from previous years and quickly walks me through them.

I am giving the software 4 out of 5 stars because sometimes it can be cumbersome to edit things after I have entered them. Particularly with small business (1099) deductions and expenses, it can be hard to make the software ""forget"" things. Also, I understand the complaints of those who are angry they have to get Premier when they used to be able to simply use Deluxe (Schedule D users). I actually had to pay $10 to upgrade my software from this to home and business to make some more significant deduction calculations related to a 1099 business. The process was seamless and $10 was not too much.

You can use your tax refund for 10% extra if you apply a portion of it toward an Amazon.com gift card...a nice bonus for those of us who buy everything on Amazon. 10% extra for free more than pays for the price of the software.",3,"[-2.447197305774423, -2.30325388624157, -1.708716845332875, 1.031969253586691, -3.163958557725626]",1.031969253586691

7655,"To use this SANDISK EXTREME UHS-I SDXC memory card the way it's intended (for advanced photography), you need an SDXC device (camera or camcorder).  You also need an SDXC device that's compatible with this new, latest SDXC format.  I was disappointed to learn that my older Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX2 camera, which is compatible with many SDXC memory cards, is NOT able to recognize and use this memory card.

A word of warning:  If your SDXC or other device is incompatible with this SDXC card, the device may suggest that you format the card.  Do not do this!  Formatting will ruin the card as an SDXC card.  SDXC devices are backward compatible (and can accept SDXC, SD, or SDHC memory cards), but SDXC cards should be used only in SDXC devices.  (To learn more about the do's and don'ts of SDXC memory cards, you can Google ""SD Association Using SDXC memory cards"".)  If you have a Panasonic camera, you can find a list of cameras that are compatible with SDXC on the Panasonic web site.  Presumably other camera manufacturers' web sites have similar lists.

Although this card doesn't work in my camera, it can be accessed with a USB reader or adapter that is SDXC-compatible; or through a WinXP, WinVista, or Win7  PC card reader slot, if the PC has the exFAT file system update (KB955704) that can be downloaded from the Microsoft Download Center.  My fairly recent Win7 PC (ASUS Essentio Series) is not compatible with the above file system update, but already had a driver that enabled it to access the SDXC card without formatting.",3,"[-1.4027567420733131, -1.7252681655496171, -2.1577671483073617, 1.0180631238186806, -2.645500651795696]",1.0180631238186806
