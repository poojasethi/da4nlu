First off, the writing wasn't bad, but there were quite a few mistakes. If there was an editor, they clearly did a poor job.

Secondly, the characters weren't anything to write home about. Lyric is naive and boring. She claims to want to be a senator but she spends more time sleeping with inappropriate men than she does doing anything revolving around her ambitions. Royal is very stereotypical and macho. Nothing he did impressed me. Lyric clearly put up with far more than I would have from him. I didn't really see any chemistry between them. The sex scenes were average--definitely nothing hot enough for me to rave about, like some of the other reviewers.

The plot was boring. The author tried to cook up plenty of suspenseful plot devices, but it actually came off contrived and kind of silly. Lots of backstabbing and double-crossing and violence for the sake of violence.

Right out of the box, the first thing I discovered was the defective glass lid. It didn't even come close to fitting the slow cooker, and was so far off that it rattled constantly while the cooker was in use.

The next problem occurred when my wife discovered a burning rubber odor, which failed to go away after multiple uses.

The third issue was the fact that the slow cooker was never capable of fully cooking the food placed in it. My wife cooked chicken breasts, but after the suggested time was reached, the chicken pieces were still raw in the middle.

I thought that KitchenAid was a manufacturer of premium products. If this slow cooker is any indication, they certainly have a problem on their hands.

So I watched this movie.  And I have no idea what I was supposed to like about it.  Cool cars, okay.  But after about ten minutes of watching non-actors doing some non-acting (except for Warren Oates, who, well, drives a lot), I could not figure out what I was supposed to like about this movie.

Characters, plot, dialogue, gags, stunts.  Low-brow and obvious, but I didn't scratch my head and wondered what the heck was even going on like I did suffering through TWO LANE BLACKTOP.

In the first book, Dons quirkiness (somewhere on the Aspergers Spectrum) was a major player in the book, but it wasn't the only player.  The other characters seemed to have more to contribute.

In this book, Dons behavior seems so forced and so contrived.  Every single thing he says and does is tainted with his quirkiness, to the point of absolute annoyance.

For example, a woman is about to breast feed her baby.  Here is the quote from the book:

The discussion was interrupted by the arrival of a nurse carrying a baby which I assumed was Sonia and Daves.  I was well aware from the Antenatal Uproar that social convention took precedence over maximizing immunity through the sharing of breast milk.

Sonia commenced the nutrition and immunity-improving process.

That last sentence was just annoying.  I cant see Don looking at every single thing like this.  I just don't remember the first book being so constantly over the top like this.

I finished the book, but it was not with the enjoyment that I felt on the first book.",1,"[0.08963328386317593, 2.763239151625612, -1.998692078677145, -1.054802615035625, -2.2676387201329478]",2.763239151625612

I didn't really care for the plot. It was kind of cliche, and wasn't done as well as I would've liked. I didn't connect with the characters. And all the running from feelings was annoying.

5557,"Apparently this book follows in the great French tradition of large books.  Unlike some of those large books, this one I had a hard time getting into.  I admit that I honestly was confused from the start and that helped nothing moving forward.  There are too many non-moving parts at the beginning.  Too much background without plot.  The one thing I can attest to is that the research has been done on the author's part based on the extensive bibliography at the back.  Maybe part of the problem is that this is a translation and something is being lost for me there.  The sentences are short and choppy in construction at times which meant I skipped over whole sections without realizing it and several pages later wondered, briefly, what I missed. I also found that I could not keep the characters straight for very long.  Too many of them with names that were too unfamiliar for me even with the help of the glossary at the back.  Had this been a straight nonfiction narrative, I think it would have worked better for me personally.  The fictions of the story just aren't doing it for me.
After the second attempt at reading this, nothing was much better.  To me, this book just needs the right readers to find it.  I like my action and plot to begin when the writing begins, not halfway through the process.  The Prologue was interesting despite the fact I had no idea who ""he"" was half the time since that was a constantly shifting pronoun.  I guess I just needed more clarity at times.  But then the first chapter started and the whole experience just fell apart.  So, this one is probably more for fans of slow moving character pieces than the plot and action driven narrative.

Unfortunately, the gamble I took in requesting Gambling on the Bodyguard did not pay off.  My romance book-loving friends, the author simply tried too hard on this one.  Instead of a realistic romantic tale, it came across overly sentimental with its at times stilted/overly drawn out dialog and the too frequent, overly long, sometimes even weird, racy scenes which hijacked any hope of an actual storyline. The weird comment is directed at the use of bacon and syrup, by the way. Throw in the too unlikely coincidences regarding the heroines occupation (ski instructor) and the circumstances surrounding the heros sisters death, which he blamed himself for, and I was ready to bail about 40% into it.

Wait, theres more.  The heros constant I want to be with you but you deserve someone better than me felt too sappy and redundant for this reviewer. O.K. Thats enough. There are a few more things I could mention, but I think you get the point. Since I don't like writing critical reviews, it pains me to be so brutally honest, but thats my job.  To give an honest, unbiased opinion in exchange for this ARC generously provided by this great publisher.  Unfortunately, this one just didn't work for me.

Do yourself a favor.  Consider reading Book 6 of this series, Tamed by the Outlaw by Michelle Sharp, instead. I do highly recommend that one.

7607,"I'll make it very simple. I read the reviews on this product and they all were great. I purchased it after comparison with the competitors (none existed back then) and I ordered them from an online retailer. I try them day one and they don't fit my ear well despite me trying various standardised (include) ear clips. I thought maybe this is a new concept and takes time so the one nearest to fitting, I used that for a couple of days after which I realised they are painful and must be returned besides they don't stick for long. My despair was that the website refused to accept it back saying the product works exactly like its supposed to work and they cant do anything about that. They said the fact that it doesnt feel comfy for me - is not their concern because the product is designed to be like that but they cant accept it because they cant resell it and because I cant find anything wrong with it and its working as designed. This is the first time I have been duped by a retailer online and since then I have stopped depending on them for things like refunds and warranties. Somewhere I am still under agony... I haven't even used them once and these just sit around.

Secondly,

i did try to contact Plantronics who said they don't have any further customised ear clips to send to me and said the online retailer should take them back sighting what ever differences between usability and experience.

But let me say up front that perhaps that is because I had not read the books that came before and therefore I was struck by the strange parts of the story that didn't get resolved (won't put in spoilers but I am referring to all the stuff that happens to Eli's family...)  So my first recommendation is not to read this as a stand-alone because it just doesn't work unless it's a continuation of some other story.  Quite apart from that aspect, I found both H and h unbelievable:  adult platonic ""friends"" sharing a bed regularly  and being so involved in each other's sex lives felt both tacky and immature.  Then came the last 1/3rd of this novella which was just a bunch of sex scenes.  Don't get me wrong, I have no objection to sex scenes but they are usually more interesting when they are part of a  plot and/or there is a plot-related reason they are included.  At first it was interesting but I kept wondering where it was leading and the answer was nowhere that hadn't been made clear between H and h, before they eventually fell into bed together.  So, it just felt like padding.

In this book I found the hero too much of a villain and the female lead too weak to walk away.  Alpha heroes are great, but not when the women around them are shown as bodies to be used without much backbone or self esteem. Enough is enough.
The sex scenes are way too long, far too many words to describe in great depth what could be better handled if something were left to the readers imagination.  I can't help but wonder if her publisher gives her a minimum word count and the sex scenes are her way of coming up with the required number of words.

9358,"I found this DVD is the used bin when shopping the other day, and literally for pennies (ok $3), I couldn't believe my good fortune. I immediately snapped this up of course. I hadn't seen ""Live at Pompeii"" in many, many years. I didn't even know that a new ""Director's Cut"" had been released, so I was quite intruiged by this.

""Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii"" (171 min.) starts off with the ""Director's Cut"" (91 min; in 16:9 widescreen). I was a little surprised to see all the additional space footage, I mean how weird is it to see International Space Station footage from (I'm guessing) the 1990s in a concert film that was filmed in late 71/early 72! I also couldn't quite understand the logic behind adding footage (not concert footage, even) from the band messing around at Abbey Studios on various ""Dark Side of the Moon"" material. All rather strange. The original film (60 min; in 4:3 full screen) is also included, thankfully. While I prefer watching the widescreen ""refit"", the original shorter movie makes a lot more sense musically and thematically. ""Echoes Part I"" and ""Echoes Part II"" bookend the fantastic Pompeii-filmed set.

Am I the only one to think that as it relates to the Pompeii-filmed footage, Nick Mason had an inordinate amount of screen time? I'm thinking as much as the other three combined. You can't as much as catch a glimpse of Roger Waters until well into ""Echoes Part I"" for some reason. The DVD contains a 15-20 min. interview with the director Adrian Maben, and it's interesting hearing him talk about the intent of making this the ""anti-Woodstock"" film, with no spectators instead of the ""million"" at Woodstock. In the end, contrary to some other reviewers here, I don't mind all that much that Maben made a ""Director's Cut"", since thankfully the DVD presents both the old and the new versions. In all, a must-have for any Pink Floyd fan!",1,"[-0.1016784553267529, 2.2351012469348386, -1.9717256789636184, -1.1103780453714227, -1.827098841177428]",2.2351012469348386

At several points I was just fast forwarding and thinking, ""Okay yup, horny teens planning to have sex,"" or, ""Okay gun battle with no real dialogue, I can skip ahead a bit,"" and finally, ""G-Man being reprimanded for following his humanity rather than sadistic orders from his boss, I've seen this in dozens of other movies, I can skip this part.""

The movie is always either disturbing or boring, or completely predictable.

9397,"the film and the extra scenes fail to make mention of what became of the son?  Did he finish college? Is he happily living with a family of his own?  Does he work for his dad, or what?

He was a central figure afterall.  I didn't read the book, and maybe this has been addressed by someone in the other review postings, but I find it odd that the real son was left out of the ending.  This movie would not have been made if it did not have the son figure.  Did he not want to participate and why?  I fear that maybe he and his dad had a falling out.  That would be incredibly tragic and put a damper on the story.

As for the movie, my lower than average rating is because I found the movie to be sooo depressing.  A good drama builds to a climax where the action requires a ""drop-dead"" event, decision or encounter, then a resolution.  Here, 90 percent of the movie was at a climax stage.  It was one horror after another.  Okay, maybe that was the real life, but I needed a break-a few actually.  My wife and I agreed that we were glad to have not seen this at the theater as it would have been too draining.

More often than not, Dream Theater sounds like they simply borrow bits from all the other prog rock bands out there, and try to mesh into their own style, but it doesn't work at all, at least not on this CD/album.  I recognise the influences here.  When I'm listening to the album, I can hear Metallica, Rush, ELP, Yes, Pink Floyd, and even Ravi Shankar/Indian influences.  But, unfortunately, the influences don't really mess.  They're all over the place without becoming cohesive, and the album doesn't work at all.  The musicianship is generally very good, but it feels cold and mechanical.  The lyrics are tremendously pedestrian and borderline stupid.  The lead vocalist is desperately trying to bring emotion to the awful lyrics, and he ends up making them worse.  There is one tremendous song that I have played over and over again, and that's Beyond this Life.  Even though the lyrics and singing aren't very good, the music on that one track is fantastic.

The last 15% of the book was totally not needed and could have all been wrapped up in a short epilogue.  I used to be a HUGE Toni Aleo fan and Taking Shots is still one of my all time favorite books.  The thing that has steered me away from her over the years are these almost 600 page books that just go on and on with no real need.  Last, **TINY SPOILER ALERT**, I actually felt like this book was too similar to her previous book Taking Shots.  In fact the scene where we find out who her dad is could have been practically plucked right out of Taking Shots.  The insecure heroine, the heroine having the horrible verbally abusive family, her hiding secrets about her past from the hero, and I could go on and on are all way too similar.  I feel like Toni's books try to drag in too much plot line instead of digging into the main storyline.  Overall, not a fan.  There were some good moments in there but sadly they were overshadowed way too quickly with too much filler and not enough focus on the real issues.

I was hoping this book would delve deeper into the characters but that didn't happen; it didn't even do a little bit of character enrichment for the new ones. There's also the issue of things occurring that we know shouldn't happen. I hate that when writers don't write the scenes the way they naturally would be but force them a certain way because they need it to be that way. This makes me mad. As readers we read these scenes and go, ""really??!! Are you kidding me?!!"" Idk... The story just seemed like it didn't progress very far, it was just kind of flat. Don't get me wrong their are some thrilling battle scenes but ""battle scenes does not a story make"". The last thing is just a thought but I don't get the title at all. I think it's referencing the prince but I'm not sure. I'm moving on to book 3 but only because it's on kindle unlimited; I don't think I would otherwise.

The book is really well written, and the author has an amazing imagination, but this is a tough book to get through.

I was, ultimately, extremely disappointed. To be honest, I couldn't even make myself finish the book. The writing was disjointed and strange (but not in a pleasant manner).

The pictures didn't really help along the story, but seemed to just confuse the plot and muddle the story. The characters were boring. The main character wasn't anyone I could enjoy reading about.

The writing was only okay and there were some editorial ""misses"" which were annoying (things like forgetting what they were eating from one page to the next, etc. Nothing critical but still...)  but in all I was able to suspend my disbelief and enjoy the story.  Basically both H/h were very young (24) and they were both sort of silly (Ben gets worried cause he's been sleeping only with ONE person for TWO weeks?? )  The emotions were not conveyed as well as in some of Layne's later work:  her writing has improved since she wrote this one.

I'm neither ignorant nor illiterate but this writing style was so 18th century mixed with 21st century Gothic creepiness that it required rereading passages several times to tease out the meaning that was buried within. I'm all for using atypical vocabulary in stories but prefer the sentence structure to be somewhat easier to follow.

OK, the story was good. But I felt like I was watching a movie at a drive-in theatre (for those who know what those are) on a foggy night. The story was there but I had to strain to see it through the obscuring fog. That's why I'm only giving Hemlock Grove 3 stars. Maybe I've gotten lazy.

Mostly it was the first half -- I had a hell of a time getting into the story, and almost put it away. I felt like the writing didn't flow as smoothly or something...either that or I was just in a mood.

I'm also big on characters, and I was only so-so on Courtney and Clay. Not sure if I just didn't get a good read on them, but it took me a bit to warm up to them. They had their funny moments, but I guess I was just missing some depth....which is funny, b/c I think I'm in the minority for this opinion.

I also had a hard time wrapping my head around the speed with which their relationship moved... I mean, they talked about it themselves and how sometimes you just 'know', but I guess I just had a hard time suspending my disbelief that you could move on after less than a week. But that could be just a personal thing....

Lastly (on the con side -- which this review is feeling super negative and I really hate that), I was missing some sort of conflict...or climax...or something. It just felt very sweet and everyday. Which is not a bad thing, but I guess it's not what I was looking for, you know? Maybe I just wanted more from the conflicts we were presented with (Mike, Nicole, Grant, Maggie).

On the plus side, the sexual chemistry between Clay and Courtney was off the charts. And I really enjoyed the secondary characters (from Clay's parents to Courtney's Mom, to Maggie, Luke, Jenna and Brad).

But, I don't understand why the movie was split between 2 disks, why it was as long as it was, or why anyone still thinks that DiCaprio can act?
Daniel Day Lewis performance was excellent.  Scorsese would have done well with more subtlety and editing.  Apparently, he believes that viewers are too dumb to connect the dots on our own.  The blood scenes are stomach turners, and the sex orgies were gratuitous.  The scenes of prayer before the climatic violence was lifted out of the Godfather, and Cameron Diaz looked too clean and pretty for a character from that neighborhood.

1609,"I was annoyed and frustrated through 80% of this book. The reason is, that by my standards, the author does not play fair with the reader. Here are two examples. The book opens with the protagonist having a breakup fight with his girlfriend. Some of the characters in the book know the reason for this fight and how it relates to another incident, known by almost all, they discuss but which is held from the reader. Instead, they make oblque references to both.

This leaves the reader ignorant but the books players informed unlike, say, an Agatha Christie novel where the reader is invited along to solve the mystery with the protagonist and both parties having equal information.

Then again, this withholding of information results in a final 20% that has an enormous impact on the reader. Ive rarely read a book that has this much power, excitement and satisfaction in the wrap up. Its plainly masterful. All the loose ends get tied, plot get mysteries solved and were finally clear or at least less muddled if were reading a thriller, a mystery, a horror novel or a supernatural tale. I wasn't sure until the end and, in a way, still am not.

Another issue is that the protagonist isn't likable  even in the least. By the end, many will have sympathy for him while others will detest him. Im in the latter camp, but I do understand the fellow maybe more than I wish to.

I can recommend this book without reservation, but wish the author would have somehow avoided creating that sense of annoyed frustration I had through a good deal of the books length.

I think she writes a good story but somehow so far hasn't totally satisfied me but I'm still persevering.  I admit to buying her books due to the low price but also based on the reviews.  ""The Heat"" had very, very many 5 star reviews and a few very bad reviews. I ended up somewhere in the middle.

I liked the strong characters, the alpha werewolves being their stereotypical arrogant, brutal selves like most of the genre. There were a few new twists and turns to their mythology which was well done.  As in the other HKW books I've read, the action scenes are very suspensefully written and the sex steamy.

Along with other reviewers, I wonder why there are so many typos, misplaced words and grammatical problems with Kindle books generally?  Why can't they be edited properly?  Is this the author's fault?  The errors can distract you from the story quite easily.

While there are other paranormal romances I've enjoyed more than this one, I will go on to read the rest of the series.  It's not as bad as some of the reviewers say and there is certainly something that still attracts me to this author.

Of course I felt bad for Kellan because he was shocked by her behavior and the way she acted.  She was very demanding and he honestly didn't know whether to scratch his watch or wind his butt.  What did she expect when she showed up unannounced?  She seems pretty desperate for a 19 year old.  Her character just didn't mesh well with this story.  She's self-centered and has the gall to call HIM a jerk....not sure if she actually said jerk but its implied.  Give the man some breathing room!  Kellan is supposed to be this alpha werewolf...yeah he's a lone wolf but he seemed more like a beta or something.  Never acted alpha like at all kinda wimpy!  Owen kicked some ass though.  Kellan at times seemed about as immature as Molly sometimes.  Their ""relationship"" seemed too rushed.  We got details about everything else going on around them but nothing much in the way of Kellan and Molly.  I know its a short story but you have to be more thorough than that.  Characters need to make sense and be somewhat likable.  Not every character can be loved and I get that but seriously Molly...ugh didn't like her.",1,"[-0.8848280305012008, 1.76894827614483, -2.152559967060834, -1.0483982094770652, -2.013630821937555]",1.76894827614483

236,"Julie Anne Long is on my ""auto buy"" list and this latest offering will keep her there.  The writing is wonderful, with lots of hidden meanings (and some not so hidden:  H/h's names are Adam and Eve...)  and symbolism and extremely smart dialogue.  In fact, I can always count on this author to provide amusing and witty conversations and there are great ones in this book.  The story has a nice pace and leads up to a slow boil of passion and tension.  So well done!!
A believable tale of love and passion between the courtesan and the vicar was going to be hard to pull off and it was well done all the way until the denouement.  Sadly, that was just too over-the-top, required too much suspension of disbelief and almost ruined the book for me.  That is why I only gave this book 4 stars and, in fact, this was more of a 3.5 stars.  Also, I am not sure what happened to the editing but this book needs to be re-edited and corrected!  There were way too many typos and grammatical erros (lots of wrong pronouns, for example.)  Very strange and not characteristic of this author at all.  Finally, another problem was the change in the heroine's name:  I just told myself if was the author vascillating between the heroine's  aristocratic monikers but it was very distracting.  In fact, the first time Eve, ""Lady Wareham"" was suddenly ""Lady Balmain"" I groaned, assuming poor editing.  There is probably an explanation but it took me out of the book each time it changed.  Not good.
Nevertheless, I remain a total Julie Anne Long fan -- ""What I did for a Duke"" was a masterpiece as was her last one -- this one doesn't quite reach that level but it was pretty darn good!

241,"Upon first read of the synopsis, you would think this is a dystopian similar to Aguirre's Outpost Series. But in actuality, what we have here is a loosely written and moody dystopian without the violence.  The story is interest

The plot involves Marina - the only person to survive an attack by the Fade (parasitic creatures existing in darkness).  She will spend most of the book coming to terms with why she survived and who she is (which may or may not be a surprise to readers).

There are some dystopian tired plot devices - evil leader, misunderstood enemies, even a love triangle. But they didn't bother me considering the originality of the rest of the book.

What keeps this from being a 5 star read is the writing - there wasn't enough expository filling in segues or actions.  One minute someone is doing something then they are doing something completely different without any kind of bridge. It meant that I had to stop and go back and reread to see if I missed something.  It was bad enough that about half way through the book I just stopped trying to figure out the utterly confusing descriptions or action scenes and rushed to the ending.  It was problematic enough to really kill the enjoyment of what was otherwise a decent dystopian story.

It wasn't as creepy as it is made to seem - there is tension but mostly it is about Marina interacting with those around her and coming to understand her memory.  And unlike many dystopian - no cliffhanger.",1,"[-2.1083248506492653, 1.7598716692512935, -2.0298731274891124, -1.061231377772851, -2.3199215431119935]",1.7598716692512935

586,"On average, I read one book a week, so it's amazing to me that I would spend roughly four weeks reading this very magnum opus.  OK, I've been drowning in work and haven't had much time to curl up with any book, good or bad.

Speaking of good and bad, the good news is that I didn't put the book down. Faber creates a complete world of characters, time and place.  His London of the 1870s is extremely real; you can almost smell the dog turds he writes about, taste the bland food he comments on and hear the cacophony of the city.  The characters, too, are profoundly real; I never once doubted their existence.  And while I wouldn't say that the book was gripping, it did hold my interest throughout.

The bad news is that there's very little plot.  In fact, if you read the back cover (of the paperback version), you get the whole story - prostitute lures a wealthy man into keeping her.  The book doesn't end there, but that's what keeps it going for most of its 890+ pages.  And [SPOILER ALERT] it leaves the end, well, undone - you don't know what happens to the characters, or if (or how) they will survive.

Taking into account that it's fiction, I'm willing to suspend disbelief...... To a large extent but eventually became too bizarre.

With this book, the menace is very subtle, for the most part, even with some of the more explicit scenes.  But there is a counterpoint to this, which is a low grade, restrained pull of attraction between these two which lifts the narrative up a notch.

And if ever a movie deserved a Special Edition DVD, it's this one.  I've watched the movie plus the 13 minutes of deleted scenes and the documentary on the making of the film and I'm still hungry for more.  It deserves every second of attention.
(I'd liked to have seen more discussion of the novel but, as has been known for decades, author Ken Kesey never saw the movie and distanced himself from it.  He said it would have been like ""watching his child murdered"" or something.  Go figure.  How many novelists would have given their writing arm to see an adaption as good this one?)
One thing that struck me watching the movie after all these years is how director Milos Foreman never misses an expression in every scene.  From the documentary, we find out that he filmed without letting the actors know who was being filmed, so the acting and timing and editing become a marvel to watch.

9416,"One of the other reviewers compared the movie to a combination of Legally Blonde and Revenge of the Nerds.  That is pretty accurate.  Fans of Anna Faris know that she has very good comedy acting chops (from the scary movie franchise and Waiting).  She is definitely not afraid of saying or doing something totally stupid and ridiculous.  She pulls off the ditzy Playboy Bunny, with a kind heart and smarter than she seems quality very well.  There is definitely not a lot of depth to the character she was trying to play, but what depth there was, she played it well.

The movie has mix of stars who have become A list or B list (mainly Emma Stone and Kat Dennings which the movie did an awesome job of making look plain and downright unattractive respectively before the ""makeover"") with reality tv stars, musicians and lots of cameos from celebrities.  Even though it was not meant to be a movie that was going to win the actors any awards, the fact that at least some of the stars had the ability to act made it as good a movie as it is.  It is definitely not a movie designed to make you think, and it is definitely making fun of the whole fraternity/sorority culture.  It did not try to do too much and pretty much stuck to the comedy that it was meant to be.

This is not a movie that will appeal to everyone.  It is for the most part a mindless comedy that is not meant to, or try to make you think very much.  It had a lot of cute girls in skimpy outfits and/or showing lots of cleavage.  If that is not the kind of movie that entertains you, skip it.

3183,"*I received a free copy of this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.*

When I first starting reading Beyond Limits, I wasn't sure if I would like it. My main concern was that I felt like I was missing something, like I should have read all the preceding books in the series. My other concern was that I didn't expect so much of it to be related to the military, which worried me because of how a lot of books often portray military men as demanding jerks.

I have to say that those concerns evaporated very quickly. By the second or third chapter, I could see that I didn't have anything to worry about. My concern about having missed something was short-lived, because everything I needed to understand the current story was right there on the pages.

My other concern was also short-lived, because I learned that isn't how Laura Griffin writes her military characters. I was relieved and impressed by how she handled it. The men have the good qualities like protectiveness, physicality, and bravery, but none of the expected bad characteristics like egocentrism or excessive arrogance.

One thing that stands out in my mind about Beyond Limits is how incredibly real everything felt. I have no military or law enforcement knowledge, so I cant attest to the accuracy. However, it seemed very well researched.

If you like a book with exciting action, hot sex, a satisfying romance, and solid investigative work to track down terrorists, you should give Beyond Limits a try. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.

From the novel's beginning, I felt totally pulled into the story. There was such a depth of sacrifice and a tangible quality to the emotion in the story, but none of it was overdone or too dramatic. From what appears to be a setting and a situation that was devoid of hope, Klassen created a powerful story of love and sacrifice.

It's obvious that Klassen made researching for this novel a top priority. Having never read anything about wet nurses or a novel that deals directly with the life of unwed mother's during this particular time in history, I found all the detail to be engrossing.

The plot was steady and realistic. It held my interest the entire time. Just when I thought I knew what was going to happen, a new circumstance would appear, but it all felt natural to the flow of the story. In a genre that has issues with predictability, Klassen kept me guessing the entire time. I wasn't entirely certain how the story was going to end.

Speaking of the ending--the ending also worked so well, in my opinion. While it was happy, not everything was perfect. As in real life, not every relationship was mended, and the characters did not achieve their happiness without some regret along the way.

I was already a fan of Klassen, but this is by far my favorite of her novels that I've read thus far. She is definitely one of my favorite writers in the Christian fiction world and historical fiction, in general. Highly recommended!",1,"[-0.6618893253966385, 1.6394938151004852, -2.1243793815990335, -1.054679816761495, -1.9914627714813333]",1.6394938151004852

9320,"I generally like unusual movies like this one -- this movie, though, was a disappointment of gigantic proportions. The main character played by Tom Cruise is a selfish magazine owner born with a silver spoon in his mouth. That's OK, even though he's not a very likeable character, he does have enough redeeming qualities to make you care what happens to him. Penelope Cruz is a sweet, enthusiastic character who doesn't fall for his tricks, but falls in love with him and he falls for her. A stellar performance by Cameron Diaz as a woman used by the main character for sex, takes the ultimate revenge and scars him for life. What ensues after that is a twisted maze of continuously changing storylines, leaving the viewer completely confused at what's going on. Worst of all, you don't even care. I agree with the other reviewer who said this movie is disjointed. It's so disjointed that half-way through the movie I almost shut it off. Still, I stuck it out. My persistence wasn't rewarded as the story became more and more convoluted. At the end you are left with an even more disjointed ending that leaves you saying to yourself, ""what the hell was that all about!""

2835,"Too Bad To Die is described as a WWII thriller in which British Naval Intelligence officer Ian Fleming races to foil a Nazi plot to assassinate Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin at the Tehran Conference. Since I am a big fan of historical thrillers and especially those set during WWII, I was certain Too Bad To Die was going to be a big hit with me.

To its credit, I enjoyed the rich historical detail Francine Mathews packs into her latest book, and I learned a lot about many of those people who were world leaders and influencers of those leaders during WWII.

Unfortunately, however, I felt that Mathews spent so much of her book packing historical details into it that they overshadowed her ability to tell a tense and enthralling thriller. For me, Too Bad To Die moved at such a slow pace that by the time any real thrills and actions occurred they were too little, too late. Further, while the tidbits about many of the 'real people' characters were interesting and, at times, juicy, Mathews' ability to present richly developed characters -- including her main character, Ian Fleming -- was just mediocre. As a result of these flaws, on several occasions I came very close to giving up on this book.

Throw in every horror/slasher movie cliche this one had it.  I am all for having to suspend disbelief when watching one of these movies, but things like the killer being able to movie bodies around in a short period of time, and leave no trace of blood is just stupid.  Unlike the plot twist revealing the killer in the first movie, this one was easy to spot a mile away.  Plus we are subjected to Jack Black as a dreadlocked stoner.

The two things that this one had going for it is that the dialog was not as schlocky and stupid as it was in the first one.  And, despite the tease at the end of the movie, they thought better of making any more of these.  Like the predecessor I do not think this is a must see or must own.

--I now call dibbs on Slade, Cale, and Hemy!! They are MINE!!--

A man lost in his own darkness and who uses sex as a weapon to drive away his demons.

A woman with a secret who just might be the remedy he needs to see the light.

She's different than other girls. She's more than just a f*#ck. She's addictive, but the right kind of addiction.

She makes me want to be a better man; makes me want to be the old me.

Because I love it when you touch me, It makes me feel as if I'm breathing. Makes me feel...alive.

Can she be the salvation to his darkness? Will Slade overcome his past and fight for his future? And with parties breaking down all of their own rules and barriers, will their romance take flight? Or will hinderances deter them to ultimately walking away to the walk of shame?

Read and you will find out!!

He's like an addiction. Everything about him just calls out for me; my body needing him to survive.

It was unstoppable and I knew I was screwed in the best way possible. I wanted to know more. I wanted to help ease your pain. I wanted to cure you.

This man completely owns me...I am almost willing to give him everything; not just my body, but my heart.

My thoughts: It's like how I said in the beginning. This book was a fast and easy read and just captured my attention through and through.

The only downfall though is, since it is a novella, it didn't have a whole lot of plot. Otherwise, it was over all an extremely satisfying read and looks like to be a standalone for this couple I think.

352,"I had uncommonly high expectations prior to reading this account of the Great War. I consider myself a devoted reader to authors such as Hazel Gaynor and Lauren Willig and so I knew the storyline was something that I wanted to analysis. Truthfully the novel didn't necessary meet the presumptions that I had regarding the material.

At the introduction of the novel I found myself lost. The story is not at all written, with the subject matter and concerning a large amount of absent detail. Such details that are mentioned are those that involve a destructive violence that I would prefer not to be included in any book. So almost instantly I was turned off by the novel, but I continued anyhow only to come to the sad conclusion that none of the stories thrilled me.

Each of the stories seem to ramble about with leading characters that really do not have to survive after the Great War. I both hated and admired the traits among the characters as putting one's life back together following a war is never easy. The determination to continue moving forward with their individual lives is something I favored with each story. Still, from a reader's point of view none of the stories were well-written due to the lack in detail.

Hyde's story was amazing. He's an alpha ma with so much tenderness underneath.

Life can issue so much uglynes, but second chances are the best.

6347,"I LOVE Emma Harts stories! I love her characters! I love her words and how they make me laugh! I love how her words make my heart happy and feel! She has a real talent! So I know, if I see her name associated with a book that I am going to read it ASAP and I know I am going to love it! The degree of love changes a bit with every book some I obsess over and cant wait to either reread or hope and pray she comes out with another book that is connected to these people that Ive fallen for already. I know, I shouldnt be so partial to a particular author but once youve read an Emma Hart book you will get it!! Prepare yourself, because Miss Fix It is a book that I NEED more from!! Im thrilled to see an upcoming Miss Mechanic book in December! I have found that her RomCom books addict me the most they are so funny so swoony so heart-warming so darn hot and sexy that you will NOT be able to stop reading! Im warning you all now!

Brantly didn't stand a chance after he had one look at Kali! I mean, we have a woman who can fix anything! Talk about a total role reversal! I loved how passionate she was about working with her hands. She loves her job. No Brantly had his work cut out for him in getting Kali to fall for him! She loved his twins almost immediately how could she not?! But Kali wasn't in to dating her clients and she didn't want children. Brantly had two strikes against him going in. He worked her over though!

Yall have to read this one! Its such an entertaining and engaging read! Emma Hart pulls you in with her perfect writing! She writes such a fun story! The banter the main characters had was so great! The sass Kali emits is so darn amusing! Her sassy, snarkiness is her tough exterior for that big soft heart she hides inside! This is one funny and sexy story that you don't want to miss! #OneClick this bad boy now and enjoy a fun night of witty banter and sexy heat!",4,"[-4.686818389482344, -2.533219909029077, -3.777345535976611, -1.1291068943970277, 1.5906641481761032]",1.5906641481761032

633,"I read Everybodys Fool by Richard Russo immediately after reading Nobodys Fool.  I hate to say it, but I enjoyed Nobodys Fool much more.  But even with that being said, Everybodys Fool is still a fine book.

Russo brings us back to North Bath, New York.  This time the story is focused on Doug Raymer.  Doug was a supporting character in Nobodys Fool, but now he is front and center.  Doug is the chief of police and spends most of his time trying to find the man who is wife was about to leave him for when she fell down the steps and died.

The novel is filled with slices of life that Richard Russo does so well.  He weaves humor expertly through the whole novel.  You really start to feel like you know these people as people not just characters in a book.

The only thing that I didn't like about the novel was that Russo kept trying to get the reader up to speed on what had happened in Nobodys Fool.  It reminded me of how they talk in soap operas, where they try and keep the viewer up on the story, like Oh, theres John, he looks well even though he fell in the well after chasing the thief who robbed the bank last year and then married his daughter.  Thats not a real example, but there was too much of that going on.  I don't think it was necessary.  This novel and its characters had enough story to stand on their own, I don't think the reader had to be reminded of events from the earlier book.

A very enjoyable read.",1,"[-1.01637511939772, 1.5859935550838276, -2.584112439439557, -1.0823106403381848, -1.1657399737916911]",1.5859935550838276

Maybe it was the geography -- Livingston, NJ isn't exactly Hong Kong.  Maybe it was the adolescent attitude of the protagonist, who seems to have some issues with authority figures just doing their jobs. Maybe it was the holier-than-though attitude of two characters who assist runaway teens in New York's Hell's Kitchen.  I dunno.  It was a good story, but it just didn't turn me on.

This was a big mistake. I should have read the reviews here first since it seems most were not big fans of this novel. It was boring, repetitive and seemed to drag on forever. At one point I even sped up the playback on my iPhone just to try to get through it faster. It seemed to take forever to get to the point of the book and when it did, I was either completely bored and ready to quit, or the ending was really that anticlimactic.

The characterization was terribly weak and the plot was a hodge-podge that was, so often, not credible.  The blurb on this book states that Kyle is a 14-year-old when his father dies and the story takes place 12 years later.  The opposite is true, however--Kyle was 12 when his father ""died"" and the story takes place fourteen years later.
Kyle's ""father"" is never developed in a credible way and the dialog attributed to him is quite lame.  In fact, most of the dialog in the novel is contrived and unbelieveable.
The plot takes twists and turns that are almost suspenseful one or two times but fall flat the remainder.  I was not familiar with this author and the ""New York Times Bestselling Author"" on the cover definitely got my attention.  After reading the book, however, I would steer clear of other Lashner books.
I would recommend passing on this one. Random + poor dialog = DON'T BOTHER! Additionally, the syntax was really inventive and, um...annoying. I am happy to finally be done with this novel.",1,"[-1.277369941492509, 1.5432659623342802, -2.03925430298957, -1.0740825422227775, -2.0713044463798562]",1.5432659623342802

I wasn't disappointed.

The writing flowed well and kept me captivated. The story is wildly interesting. I had no idea that spiritism was such a big thing in America and that such prominent names were involved with it.

More than once, I got a bit freaked out after finishing a chapter. The seances could be quite spooky to read about and I can only imagine how much spookier they were for the people experiencing them. Even though mediums were routinely exposed as false and their tricks discovered, that didn't diminish the eerie feeling that permeated throughout the book.

When it comes to complaints about the book, I have only one. It was too long.

The historical account was enough to raise the hair on the back of my neck and make my arms break out in goosebumps. But it took so long to get anywhere with the story that I got frustrated. There are a lot of in-depth backstory about people that don't have much, if any, relevance to the story.

Length aside, The Witch of Lime Street is fabulous. It's a well-researched and fascinating account of a time in our history when science and spiritism nearly joined hands.

9247,"I hadn't seen this film before watching the remake, and I gave the remake a generous 4 stars ( I say generous because it was undeserved) and after seeing this film and seeing what the remake had to work with I'm appalled the remake wasn't better.  At least the ending to this film make sense.  The acting here is decent, for a 70's film, and Hackman (who is always top notch) and Winters both did wonderfully.  The action and adventure is this film is high intensity, and while the remake did copy a few of this films best scene's the brilliance was lost in the translation.  Point being that the original, in this instance, is much better than the remake and should be enjoyed by all who haven't had the opportunity to see it yet.  The story is similar in both, both involving a cruise liner flipping over due to a rogue wave, each set in their own time periods, but what makes the films differ is the people aboard.  In this film you have a priest (Hackman) struggling to make his way right with god, and he is the one who ushers everyone to safety.  He wants to help everyone.  In the remake you have a professional gambler only concerned with his own safety.  Not that that is the main reason this film is better, for this film also gets you involved with the cast of characters, understanding all of them, knowing all of them and so you thus can be concerned about all of them.  I guess all that really needs to be said is that if you're like me and you've only seen the remake, please rent this movie and see the masterpiece that inspired the flop.",1,"[-3.632643479721799, 1.5176339137063524, -1.8737944232527068, -1.0832213065042329, -1.8117679425295334]",1.5176339137063524

9563,"This movie is one of those that for me is hard to give an ultimate rating because I can see why it didn't do well in theaters but at the same time has some things going for it that make it better than most bad movies.  This movie is one that almost feels like it is out of time, kind of like its theme with its very classic Disney feel.  In my opinion, this movie would have done better if it had been released a few decades ago with its overly optimistic and a bit preachy theme that it has as this seems to me to be a bit too much for todays movie audiences.  I am not saying that I didn't like the film though as it does have some redeeming qualities that made it ok for me to watch.  The visual and special effects are outstanding and you can see where the big budget was spent with the fantastic effects.  Cassidy as Athena also plays her role well and I think was the highlight of the actors in the movie.  The story and plotline to me was a bit scattered and lacked a bit of focus.  It was hard for me to figure out what type of audience the movie was trying to go for because at times it felt like a kids movie and at times seemed to be trying to please adults as well.  That back and forth took away from the cohesiveness of the movie and trying to please both kids and adults falls a bit flat at times.  The movies final scenes were a bit anti-climactic as well.

Is the movie as bad as some say? No I don't think so.  Nor do I think that this is a great movie.  Tomorrowland falls somewhere in between as an average one that had potential to be much more but falls a bit short of its ambitions and of its big budget. I enjoyed watching the movie; I just think it falls a bit short as a blockbuster.

7637,"So I recently bought a projector so that my wife and I can watch movies outside on our deck and the thing came with a tiny speaker built in. So when I had the chance to try out this Bose Soundlink I jumped at it. In short it sounds amazing and I recommend it if you are looking to spend $300 on a speaker.

Here's where it shines:
1. Bluetooth: the wife and I have android phones and we were both able to pair our phones to this speaker with little trouble and start playing our music. The music was clear and really sounded pretty amazing.
2. Battery: this thing has an internal battery you charge via the included AC adapter. I am not sure how long the battery is supposed to last, but in my testing I used it for over 5 hours and never had a battery issue.
3. AUX input: the projector I bought doesn't support bluetooth buth this does have an AUX input so I was able to plug in a cable to my projector and then to this speaker and it allowed me to play the audio through it, the movie came to live and this was great as that meant I didn't need a power cable thanks to the internal batteries.

Where it falls short:
1. Cost, While it sounds great at $300 it's on the high end of the cordless bluetooth speakers available today. It is VERY good, but it comes at a premium cost.
2. Protection: This speaker doesn't have any type of protection. Previous generations of this speaker had a cover that was built in. This one does not, although you can buy one from bose for an extra $35. Really? If you are already spending $300 for a speaker the least Bose could do is give you a standard case/cover for it. Because of that I am knocking off one star.

All in all, if you have $300 and like Bose you won't be disappointed with this speaker. It's clear and both music and movies comes to life when played over this speaker regardless if it's via bluetooth or a cable plugged into the AUX input jack. I really like it.",0,"[1.503678364978124, -0.03344718906541022, -2.0915978737567213, -1.0752726798748455, -1.8295328193771918]",1.503678364978124

Add to the above the fact that the h was getting stupider by the page and at 78% there was no sigh of love in the book, the story had lost its charm.

If the author could stop writing about the swelling in his pants and him adjusting his pants maybe she could write him some character enhancements that show he can be kind and rather than embarrass her  show that he has developed feeling s for her and would honestly like to see how that both might feel about each other by seeing each other during the season.

When her cousin is raped, Briony accuses Robbie, which sends him to prison. During WWII, Celia--who has left the family--and Briony--guilt ridden by her crime--become nurses while Robbie fights in France. The book has a very lovely Virginia Wolf style to it (which I recognized before the book told me so), with the stream of consciousness, emotions, and perceptions of the characters flowing together during the momentous days. The meta-book stuff (Briony writing the book and changing the events to suit her imagination and forgive her crime) isn't as grating as I usually find that sort of thing.

4180,"I don't understand the people who were freaked out by this book.  I did not find it too dark at all.  Then again several reviews had bad spoilers so I knew some of what was coming. It is a typical Pepper Winters book - unusual, dark, strangely compelling, and did I say unusual?  Her stories ARE unusual.  This one really wasn't as bad as I was led to believe.  I enjoyed the strangeness and twists (hate cliffhangers, tho, but if you have to have one, this was a lulu!!).  If you like Pepper Winters, this book will NOT surprise you with its content.  You will still like it even if it is unusual.

The hero WAS awful but I can't figure out how the other reviewers missed his slight little bit of humanity that poked out just a wee bit. THAT is what gave this book a good taste in my mouth - the hope that maybe he can redeem himself in another book.  If not, then you're gonna hate him (which is the point - he's an anti-hero - or maybe an anti-villain?).  The heroine (in my opinion only) was pretty stupid at first.  I hope she can find a brave place because I suspect the next book is only going to be darker.

I don't think it is fair for someone to give a bad review and low star count because the book is exactly what the author writes - dark with twists.  You have enough spoilers in the other reviews so why did you buy it then give it a bad review because it was what they said it was?  Give this book a chance, especially if you are used to Winters' writing style.

I don't re tell story lines in my reviews, and for good reason regarding this book... because, I don't know what I'd say?
It could be that this read was WAY outside my genre, which I will readily agree, since the only reason I picked it up was due to what I considered it to be the best choice of October's reads as a Prime member. In the aftermath, all I can say is ....OK, I won't say it again.
I read a lot, most notably police and legal thrillers. I'm not a fan of psychological thrillers and that is probably why I didn't get this book. I can appreciate the comments of the other reviewers, that delve into this genre, but even after reading those I still could not figure out what this book was about. I read it. Every page, hoping that somewhere along the line the story line would open up to me, but no dice.

Bored of the Rings, first published in the late 1960s, takes on one of the most popular and beloved works of fiction in the English language, J.R.R. Tolkein's Lord of the Rings trilogy.  The Harvard Lampoon authors stick close to the original story, compressing it while squeezing in lots of silliness.  I was reminded of the old Mad magazine parodies I used to read (although those were done in comic book format).  The final product is sometimes funny, but comes across as a bit stale and dated.  I think Bored will best be enjoyed by fans of the Tolkein's books and the movies, probably not so much by those readers not familiar with the original story.

It was unrelentingly tense for the entire movie, and I came away from it more exhausted than entertained.

""The Dark Knight Rises"" did not make the same mistake. While much of the movie is tense, and often depressing, the mistakes of the previous effort were avoided. There were plenty of tension breaks and brief moments of humor in this film, even during the most critical dramatic scenes. That saved it from being a beat down of the viewer, and allowed me to enjoy the movie without the exhaustion I felt from its predecessor.

This story is epic in scope, and puts the Batman through some paces he's never faced on film before. It certainly reminds me of some of the Limited Series in the comics where he faces failure, both in action and in mind. There is depth here to go with as much action as any action junkie could desire.

This is not a 5 star wallet if all factors are considered. I 've had expensive wallets from Italy and this is not in the same class. My review is taking into consideration the price, workmanship and what it is supposed to accomplish with RFID blocking.

Reiterate. Repeat the characters details. Subtle reminders go a long way in forming a solid connection.  I never had any idea what Payton looked like other than her killer body.  No visual, no connection.  Anyway, all told from Payton's POV.  It would've been nice to hear from Dominics voice.  The controversy is forced, contrived, and ridiculous.  No turmoil.  No drama.

9394,"I, like most other viewers, didn't have very high expectations here but was hoping for some good suspense and some scares.  This movie was supposedly based on a true story and I can believe it is.  If you were to write down everything that happens on paper in order it does make sense and could have made for quite a good movie but it just didn't fully succeed.

It grabbed me in at the beginning with the 4 friends videotaping themselves.  I thought it really showed the closeness and bond between them all.  Then we go ahead 5 years and there is a reunion.  I didn't find the characters to be stereotypes but agree you found out little about them.  I thought the actors did very well with what they had.  I did believe the love and commitment between the married couple and found my concentration centering on them and their child.  I found their acting very believable and I felt for them.

I think one reason this film does not work is because a viewer knows it takes place on the sea and danger happens.  One does expect scares but nothing much happens here.  When they first end up in the water with no way back onto the boat I think the film succesfully shows their growing terror and taps into all viewers fear of water and such a situation.  It had me for a little while.  But then the movie was just too long, very little happened and the suspense did not remain.  I believe if the film was better written it could have held the suspense throughout but it just lost steam.

It grabbed me enough that I watched the whole thing and I certainly don't think it was terrible.  The premise was good and as I said before I think the actors did quite well with what they were handled.

1623,"I really really wanted to like this book. I haven't heard anything about teenage witches since Sabrina, so I definitely wanted to give this a try for it's uniqueness. Unfortunately, I found the characters unlikable, the plot predictable, and magic uneventful. There is a little bit of witch magic in there with the elements, but mostly the magic system is based on Talent. A Talent a special ability that you are born with, not something you can learn. There are plenty books out there with characters with special powers, and the blandness of it takes away from my enjoyment of Once a Witch. The main character whines often, and is very moody. She is not very intelligent, and acts extremely childish, more so than any other YA character I can think of actually. When someone tries to explain something to her or suggest something, she doesn't listen and stomps her foot until she gets her way. Her family friend Gabriel was not much better. His humor is not funny to me, and if he is romantically interested in the main character it's not very obvious. Even with bad characters, I can still enjoy a book if the plot is interesting. This one kept my interest, barely. The bad guy was obvious from when he was first introduced, and his task takes up about 3/4ths of the novel. There is a little info about a family feud thrown in there to spur more novels, but overall Once a Witch was just too short for me. The beginning was well paced, with good detail, but the ending was too fast and the details were too sparse. Another 50 pages or so of detail and epilogue would have really helped me enjoy this more. Usually it's the drama that turns me off from YA books, but this one is full of problems, and it is the first low on drama YA novel that I really didn't like.

I can't quite put my finger on one specific reason, it just seems to have been a lot of little ones. The sex between them was the same, and the sub-plots were there, but I just couldn't get emotionally involved with any of it.

The prior stories were filled with gut wrenching drama that sucked you in and left you wanting more.  This one just seemed to tie up everything a little too neatly, maybe it was due to so many sub-plots going on that left the author stretched too thin to touch us as she did in the first three books.

I see that there is another book coming out in 2015, ""The Baby"", if I was basing my desire to read it on this story alone, I wouldn't be excited at all.  I hope it proves me wrong.

She flip flopped back and forth between wanting Garrett for sex, wanting to be just friends, wanting to give a ""real"" relationship a try, to knowing they could never be more than friendly roommates so fast it was hard to keep track. One minute she could never trust anyone again, and then the next she was in tears because she'd lost her chance with him forever. Ugh. Craziness, even for pregnancy hormones. She was inconsistent in other ways too--at the beginning of the story, when she's planning on seducing him as part of her great ""get the cheating ex out of her head"" plan, she knew that Garrett had a thing for her in high school. She was counting on it. But later on when Garrett mentions the same to her brother/his best friend Mike, she acts amazed. Why? It made no sense. Garrett was a more steady character on the whole, but even he did the lightning-fast emotion change thing a time or two.

2060,"As a confirmed Scalzi fan, I have to say that this is the second outing from this author lately which has disappointed me. The other was _Fuzzy Nation_, and both imply a certain laziness or uninterest on the part of the author for his later works.

_Redshirts_ starts out with an intriguing premise but never develops that premise beyond the most superficial treatment. Instead of a brilliantly executed completely resolved convoluted plot, such as in his _Android's Dream_, _Redshirts_ adopts a tone which can best be described as all participants shouting at each other constantly while on a rushed through poorly explained resolution.

Even the resolution isn't fully expressed within the body of the plot. Instead Scalzi resorts to the lame gimmick of 'codas' which aren't really different endings  or variations, but rather tacked on plot resolutions two of which are reasonably interesting (if uninvolving) to read but one of which is more shouting cranked up to 140 dB. Yes, these elements add to the story but they also could have been worked into the main plot bringing a good deal of added texture to this shallow novel, but that would have taken some effort. Instead, (refer back to laziness) they are just thrown on at the end to lengthen the book by about a third and it's left to the reader to shoehorn them into the main narrative.

I have enjoyed previous Scalzi works so much I will surely give him another try if he chooses to produce another novel, but I doubt I'll pre-order as I did this one.

1679,"I was torn between 3 and 4 stars.  Yes, the book has some flaws, but I enjoyed it more than most ""urban fantasy.""  I should perhaps admit that I do not read vampire books -- the whole vampire thing leaves me cold.  I agree with the comments made by other reviewers:  Eugenie seems to run around without planning ahead or thinking things through.  She is astonished to discover that turning her kingdom from a temperate climate into a desert has caused hardship to its inhabitants.  Hel-lo!

I had a problem throughout with the author's use of time.  Why does everything happen in a day?  Time should elapse more normally; for example, weeks, if not months, should have elapsed between the end of the prior book and the beginning of this one; when Eugenie brings textbooks to the Otherworld, a month or so should elapse before innovations begin to built.

 I could do without the long sex scenes (mostly they make me laugh), but I know that  a lot of people like them.  I actually prefer the ""foreplay"" scenes, such as the  quasi-romantic scenes with Dorian.

On the plus side, like other reviewers, I enjoyed the cast.  Eugenie is sometimes childish, but she is young, and I think part of the story is her learning and making choices (not all of which will be right).  I don't understand why so many readers hate Kiyo.  I don't find it at all off-putting that he is excited over the birth of his child and concerned for Maiwenn; I would despise him if he didn't care.  Eugenie is acting like a child when she complains about it.  And he is not to be despised for being peaceful, and worrying that she will be corrupted by power.  It just comes down to the kind of life one wants.

The world-building was also good as far as it goes (maybe a bit derivative of Amber) but it could use elaboration.  Its rules are not clear.

In sum, it's pretty good, and I hope there is another in the works; Thorn Queen is a whole  year old.",1,"[-1.4414097315653602, 1.3864551825881537, -1.8926751480719621, -1.0260378745244898, -2.5586002721116374]",1.3864551825881537

Amanda Hocking is well known for selling, well ... quite a few self-published novels, but having not read any of them, I wasn't quite sure what to expect with Wake, the first book of a new trilogy.

I'm touch and go on stories with mermaids/selkies/sirens. They are so awkward to write about, to try to figure out logistics and such. I mean - it's not like you can actually be sexy with a fin for your lower half, right? So while I think Hocking did an admirable job trying to make this strange, mystifying race alluring, I think it all kind of got lost in a strange loops.

Because, honestly, I finished the book yesterday and here's what I remember about it: girl swims, girl falls for guy, sister falls for guy, girl swims, something bad, the end.

Was I entertained while reading Wake? Sure. I mean, I wanted to finish the book, it wasn't difficult to read, but it was a sort of morbid curiosity that ultimately led to me finishing it.

Yes, I know the producers / director / screenwriters changed a lot of stuff, some you can understand or reason why they did it, some you have not the slightest idea why they were changed. But that's always the same in translating books to screen... But, in this case, we clearly sense that every frame was shot thinking it was THE BETTER THING TO DO; it is clear they could not avoid cutting some stuff, because, after all, the trilogy is a product that must generate profits, and you could not possibly make a movie more than 3 hours long (a movie that does not end!). If TOm Bombadil sequence were put on it, for example, many viewers could possibly think the movie is ""slow"" or something like that. I think they did the best handling the artistic / commercial interests, without one damaging the other. The introductory sequence tries brief to explain to Ring history, and it was a good idea.
The cast is marvellous. The special effects are marvellous. I think that those who not read the book can sense the slow transition for the hobbits, from an idihlic existence in the SHire to a quest that raises and raises in desperation and urgency from second to second!!
Viggo Mortensen no doubt had the role of his life, and he grabbed it with both hands, making Aragorn the perfect hero, the perfect warrior.  All the cast is marvellous, simply put. They really put life into the characters.

I was pulled in right from the beginning. Everything was so captivating and enthralling. This was so extremely well written and detailed. There was this fantastic build happening as this exciting world and all these interesting characters were introduced. Loved all the suspense! I loved Mia and Nico so much. But Mia, she was fantastic! So strong in this world where she had to fight so hard and endure so much. I just loved the strength she had and how she persevered through such a hard life. And Nico. Hello Mr. Mob Boss! He was so powerful and commanding, sexy and hot. Their chemistry together was so fantastic. It was like an electric connection. I loved their animosity and that push and pull they had with one another. I thought there was great character development and I loved watching all there drama unfold and them come together. There was conflict, ups and downs, and so much heat. It was all awesome!

This was such a fantastic introduction to the Ruin & Revenge series series. There are a lot of different characters to in play, different dynamics and things happening. It was so exciting to read and I can't wait to see what will come in future stories. So much ground work was laid and I'm hooked! I love that it was told from three different perspectives. It added such a great and intriguing layer to everything that was happening. I thought it was a really fresh element that had me rooting for everyone's HEAs.

This world was raw, gritty, and violent and in the midst of it all, there were also these wonderful moments of levity woven in that I found perfect and very needed in the midst of all the drama. I thought there was a great balance between it all. I was just so into everything!

I wasn't sure what to expect when I cracked this open but I am thrilled with the fantastic story I was able to lose myself in. If you need some sexy suspense with really hot mob guys thrown in and a tough as nails heroine, definitely give this a shot. I highly recommend it.

I like the author's writing style, as well. The book flows quickly along, with lots of action, sharp dialog, and a clever sense of humor.

One thing that might not work for everyone is an overall lack of detailed explanation. Often, things happen or characters appear that aren't explained and, as the story whips along, you've either got to figure it out on your own or just accept it and go along. I have complained about this in other books, but with The Palace Job, it didn't bother me. I thought it was consistent with overall style of the book, which was is lean and spare, pared down to the essentials.

However, one thing I did miss, and the reason for the 4 star rating rather than 5, was really getting to know the characters. For the most part, the characters were still Women and Men of Mystery at the end of the book. I know that may seem contradictory after I've just said that I was fine with the overall lack of details in the story, but I wanted to know more about our gang of thieves.

I highly recommend this book to fans of fantasy that has a sense of humor. If you like Terry Pratchett's Discworld series, you will almost certainly enjoy The Palace Job.",1,"[-2.668544263319388, 1.3450549878139584, -1.8686757267485952, -1.0800892041597954, -2.1898597696572324]",1.3450549878139584

2483,"Awaken is the third and final book for Liv and Dean. I loved the first book, I liked the second book, but the third book just felt repetitive to me. I think by now their story has been told and we are all ready to move on. With that said I am glad they did have a third book and the two getting the ending they deserve and I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Dean. He is all kinds of sex.

I think my problem with the third book is by now I realized that Dean and Liv have way too much sex. I was starting to think all there is to their relationship was their physical relationship and I never thought that until this book. I was double thinking everything about them. Maybe that was the authors intent but I do not think it was.

The book was 60% sex scenes and I was skimming through the pages. I really wanted to feel connected to the married couple but I couldnt. I just kept thinking Really, sexy AGAIN?!

Liv to me in this book was just annoying. Still with everything she seemed too independent on Dean. I was proud of her though when her mother came around and she stood up for herself but she did that before Dean came into the picture.

I do not know how I feel about this book. It was needed for an conclusion but I felt it did not do the couple justice at the end. I liked the ending okay but it was predicable; I was hoping to get more from Dean and Liv at the end. I also would have liked Deans family in this book. I really enjoyed them in book two maybe because they were so dysfunctional they made an interesting story.

""Yes, and some milk.""
Seriously mundane stuff.
I've read Dee in the past but hadn't picked up any of her work in years, this is probably why. When I lose interest in an author I should probably just stay away.
I wanted to love this story, but so much of it was the two main characters talking about her millions of dollars to give away, or the coins that she had to sell.

There was some romance and mystery thrown in there, though it was easy to figure out the connections. The ""who done it"" wasn't as easy to figure out, mainly because you don't read about him until he's a suspect.

I was quite disappointed with this one and forced myself to finish it, the ending wasn't satisfying-course I did lose interest at about page 150.",1,"[-2.7641344181510705, 1.3391031913153508, -2.508431814069071, -1.0806315083165028, -1.6067572339934375]",1.3391031913153508

As fiction though, she dismisses it as ""an overwrought, overwritten novel that misses conveying the war's terrible reality and the courage of one woman."" Somehow the author failed to ""perform that literary alchemy that transforms information into a believable plot and compelling characters."" The reviewer points out the author's failure in keeping the language true to the time.

I have very dry skin, and even though the directions say apply liberally as often as needed, I found myself trying to apply this lotion more times than the law should allow.

The lotion boasts hydrating, nourishing and moisturizing.

2064,"This was a fairly good novel but I found the author's style to be a bit trying.  Chapters alternated between Claire and The Hermit.  Nothing wrong with that.  However, within a chapter the author jumped all over the place.  A paragraph about the Hermit jumps to a paragraph about Ted Kennedy, followed by a paragraph about what the Hermit thinks, followed by a paragraph about Chappaquiddick, and then a paragraph about the Hermit.  This style appears in many of the chapters and, quite frankly, it detracts from the story. Another detraction was the detailed culinary play-by-play.

In the meantime she has let Jean Claude ""marry"" the marks (this was done on stage at the vampire club and had everyone all hot and bothered...except for the reader who was appalled). After the marks ""marry"", she starts having sex with everyone in sight and it's one sex scene after another. While she is doing all this, the wereleopard is still waiting to be rescued. 2 books back the storyline was pretty much like this, but the last book was good, but that is because Anita was in New Mexico helping out Edward.

While the premise of a teacher who hates her students is definitely serviceable, I was annoyed by two things:

1.  In the movie, the teacher's supposedly brutal sense of humor was too soft.  She really should have been much crueler.  I think this is because the film was going for the wrong sense of humor.  It was going for the shock-joke nature of comedy, while it should have been aiming at a sardonic, ironic kind of humor.  I kept waiting for her to unload some nasty, soul-crushing comments on the students or other faculty, but instead she was just a paper tiger.

2.  While her character was well-sketched, she underwent a complete, unprovoked reversal at the very end that betrayed everything that had gone before.  Quite apart from the fact that that ending could be seen coming from a mile way, the movie hadn't ""earned"" it.  It felt abrupt, felt like they had just done it because her renouncing her big goal abruptly at the end of the movie and starting to love teaching was what was expected by the audience.  But the movie would have been tons more effective and memorable if she stuck it out through the end, got her plastic surgery, and then given everyone the finger at the end of the movie.  It would have been much truer to her character and the nature of the film in general.

In other words, ruined by a Hollywood ending.",1,"[-0.8933335818501582, 1.299319750734679, -2.401520336105876, -1.076662930819213, -1.6975996341464854]",1.299319750734679

Perhaps I just wasn't ready or mature enough then. I devoured The Scarlet Letter this time.

The writing is musical and easy to read.  However, I grew annoyed with the attempts made by the author to input the accent of the upper east into the conversations being held.  It was great to read the old way of speaking in the historic story, not so great to read the ""r's"" constantly replaced by ""ah's"" in the newer story.

1) The book was more literary criticism than memoir, and I frequently had to rummage through my shelves to re-acquaint my poor memory with the novel she was currently discussing. I can't say I agreed with all of her literary analyses, but it was very thought-provoking.

2) The descriptions of everyday life in Tehran were deeply moving - it is truly horrifying what they were forced to endure. I had nightmares (more than once) about being picked up by faceless black ghouls and thrown into prison for wearing pink socks or some other ridiculous offense.

3) The author skips backwards and forwards in time throughout the book in a very disorienting manner. It was impossible for me to keep the names of her students straight. She seemed to have a more intense emotional relationship with ""her magician"" than with her husband.

4) Because of its place on bestseller lists, I assumed it was a buy-it-in-the-airport-and-read-it-on-the-plane book. Not even close. It took me about ten times longer to read this than a fiction book of comparable size. The prose is so dense (and the story so depressing) it was hard to read more than about ten pages in one sitting.",1,"[-2.6252856192503042, 1.274036966590316, -2.659960233086523, -1.0697538292511835, -1.3110936610371664]",1.274036966590316

The information contained in ""The 4-Day Diet"" is nothing new.  Anyone who has gone through a weight loss program from Weight Watchers to Jenny Craig to Susan Powter have all heard about the mental preparation of losing weight so Smith's approach isn't new.

What Smith is good at it is taking the process of weight loss and breaking it down into workable bites (no pun intended) or modules.

I liked the idea of modules, although when I actually tried the diet, I was so hungry by the 5th day and no amount smooth-talking Ian Smith coaching could take away the hunger.

That said, I found that while I might not use Smith's exact model, I can modify and tweak it so it fits for me.

I was never able to find the extra recipes on the final disk but that may be a restriction of my copy or I am looking in the wrong place.

I have to admit that I did find listening to Smith a bit tiresome after awhile and perhaps I would have been better suited at reading the book rather than getting the Audio CD, but that's just me.

All in all, I liked ""The 4-day Diet"" because it contained workable solutions that could be modified to suit my lifestyle even if those solutions were something I'd heard before.",1,"[-1.3265664574411467, 1.2735936189965806, -2.103265072266965, -1.0381543669816107, -2.088531087124844]",1.2735936189965806

This new release has some murky and untouched scenes, though, the restoration has cleaned it up better than any other previous release. Most scenes are fairly detailed and quite a bit better than any other I have seen. I can't really remember what the theatrical version looked like but this is about as close as it will come. Softness resides and it is clear it probably needs a new master from the negative.

The color timing seems to be an issue for some. The older DVD was ridiculously cool and they seem to have restored a good deal of the natural, warmer coloration some were looking for. It may still seem off as do some of the other coloring choices for their other films but to me it isn't a huge deal as we at least have a decent presentation of this adventure classic. In my opinion people can at least rest easy it doesn't look like the old DVD in most scenes.

9299,"""25th hour"" is about the last day of Monty, a low-key drug-dealer, before he goes to jail to a seven-year punishment. In this last day, he wants to make amendments with his father, go out one last time with his two best friends (one the complete opposite of the other) and try to discover if the love of his life is not the person responsible for his ordeal.
But, much more than that, ""25th hour"" is a sensible movie about feelings of loss and impotence. Action is practically non-existent, and it should be that way. What makes it great is the dialogue between the interesting and different characters, always dense, tense and moody.
On top of that, Spike Lee created an ""open"" movie, instead of his previous and most famous movies dealing with close subjects, which, for me, was a great development. And he took his time to make the movie. All characters have lots of time on screen, creating very well-developed relationship situations.

4452,"I read at least 30 books a month, so there are few storylines that are completely new to me. That being said, this was an interesting read that I had no desire to cut short or give up on. I wouldn't call it cute as some others have described, but I also didn't find it the least bit boring. I've never read a similar story and thought this had some freshness, which I appreciated.

I also liked that when the women should have been pissed, they were (except for that one time). That may sound like that means the book was predictable, it wasn't actually. I mean you know it's a romance, so you figure all will come right in the end. However, my comment is more so addressing some books I've read of late where the women are silly, doormats who take whatever is given them and lack any backbone. You won't find that here, especially not in the heroine.

It does read a bit more like a new adult romance if that classification helps. All said, I found the story very much worth my time.

In the case of this book (which is part of a series)I was a first-time (mid-stream) reader.  The author made the assumption that I would have previous knowledge of the characters, which I did not.  This made my reading experience often disappointing.  It was a disjointed, mish-mosh.  The story jumps around without enabling the reader to connect to any event or character.  Overall, it was an OK book, but I certainly am not compelled to look for previous books in the series to bring myself up to speed.

802,"First of all, how can you read this title and not want to read this book? I fell in love with the title so much that the book almost didn't matter. Okay, not really, but still...you have to admit, it is pretty great.

So begins my review:

Sheesh! Don't read this book if you have anything else you want to accomplish that day. This is one of those laugh out loud, carry-the-book-everywhere-with-you-even-into-the-bathroom kind of books. If I hadn't been reading the digital edition it might have even had a bath with me. Couldn't put it down!

Once I started reading this book it captured my attention completely. The writing is modern and a times a bit risque (there are a few F-bombs but they are rather funny.) I fell in love with the main character on the first page. I did, really. She is about to get married when all Hell breaks loose and she must make a decision that will forever haunt her. It must have been tough and I think I could identify with her indecision, even if I hadn't lived through quite the same situation.

This novel is just an overall joy to read. The romance is paced perfectly. You never know exactly what to expect and the tension is just right. There is a feeling of comfort in these pages, like you have settled into your favorite pair of jeans and cuddled up in your most comfortable chair.

I loved that the main characters had such a long and developed history between them. This made the story feel somehow more logical and gave me another reason to care about what happened between them. The variety of choices the main character had on who she would choose and where she would end up kept the plot interesting and unexpected.

I didn't really see the ending coming, and I liked that I had to guess even at the last couple of chapters. Well played author.

If you are looking for a perfect book for a lazy Saturday afternoon and want to laugh, smile and just have a lot of fun, this book would be a great choice. I have found another author that I must add to my list of favourites.

I'm not particularly a James Patterson fan (I'd only read two of his books previously) but I decided to try this one.  It will make you stop and think about our perilous relationship with animals (domestic and wild) and also with the environment.

The book has Patterson's trademark short chapters...LOTS of them.  It does heighten the suspense because it gives a feeling of fast paced action.  There are a few places that the action seems a bit disjointed and often you feel that interesting parts of the book are raced through and/or not completely resolved.

But given all that, it is still very interesting.  I'd have to say it is not for the squeamish or faint of heart.  If it is made into a movie, they will have to tone down all the ""limbs chewed off"" and ""faces bitten off"" parts!

I did have a problem with the cover.  It shows the Eiffel Tower and the tag line, ""Something bad is happening out there.""  The line is fine.  BUT...while the shadowy Eiffel Town looks ominous, Paris is not an important factor in the book at all.  I kept waiting for the action to go to Paris!

Penelope Summers, known to her friends as Penny, is not the sort of heroine that compels me to care about her story. She is whiny. She complains a lot. She drinks tequila like it is water, and it's not clear that her alcohol-infused decision making is sound. She blatantly states that she is never on time, and yet she is considers her boss a troll for noticing that she is all too frequently late for work. She is concurrently portrayed as an intelligent professional with significant job responsibilities, however, every action and word out of her mouth screams immature, entitled, and dissatisfied. As a character, she was not only unlikable but unreal or poorly defined. Her endless angry ranting quickly became tiresome.

The story follows Penny from the office to being dumped by her aspiring-politician boyfriend to a cruise to a new beau. This Cinderella-like story has its own prince charming who is delightful, engaging, and a much more interesting narrator.

8020,"I bought a new black granite sink. I put it in, which is a hassle and takes a bit of time. I then noticed that the sink had a very small hole in the back inside which did not go entirely through the sink. It was likely just a bubble in the granite mix that came to the surface and remained unseen until it got to me. The hole was about a quarter of an inch in size. I didn't want to take out the sink and replace it for two reasons: one it is a lot of work and two it seems like such a waste of materials in the environmental sense.
I called the company and they would replace the sink free of charge (not install). I asked them if I fixed the hole in some way if it would void the lifetime warranty. They said ""try it"" if it doesn't work we will still cover it. That is where the J-B Weld comes in. The black color of the epoxy is almost a perfect match for the black sink.

5328,"A sports romance with BDSM elements...on paper this is one of my ideal, go to tropes...indeed there was much that I really did like about this book ...the plot was interesting and the story moved at a fast pace.....interspersed with a lot of hot, steamy scenes, indeed there is no doubt that this author really knows how to write about sex with a touch of erotica..

I loved the well developed characters and their backstory, from another series by the same author ....the friendship and love between them all was charming.... furthermore the relationship between the two main characters was at times romantic and sweet....but here is the thing although this should have been an enjoyable experience in the end I was left dissatisfied for the following reasons...

Firstly, the female antagonist, a strong, successful woman is portrayed as being sexually naive and unfulfilled  but talks openly about sexual matters in settings and with people that seemed unlikely and inappropriate... furthermore many of her decisions and reactions were based purely on her selfish needs and professional status regardless of anyone else's feelings..

Secondly the male antagonist a dominant, successful sports star, who has suffered a great personal tragedy, appears to be reckless in terms of the commitment he puts into his relationships.....and in addition he appears to have some trust issues but conversely is  willing to explore the sexual fantasies of his partner regardless of the content...I can not say anymore without giving the plot away...needless to say, in my opinion, the two main characters were not believable or particularly endearing and in the end this spoiled my enjoyment...

Overall this book was a well written romantic and sexy read but unfortunately there were too many faults with the main characters and the scenario's they were placed in for me to really find it enjoyable...I finished the story but sadly I was disappointed

First of all, we have a lead character that's hardly even likeable; it's a selfish, mean and paranoid guy.

Then, we have plot holes larger than anything I've ever witnessed. Check that bad guy Gaines, for example: to obtain the ID card, he pays one million dollars to a highly professional female killer. To kiddnap the annoying girl Kim, also a substantian part of the bad guy's plan, he hires two stupid and intoxicatd teenage boys! How clever!!

This Train Station story was being offered at a bargain price so I thought to give Bush books another shot. Well, now I know.  Holly Bush and I aren't a good fit.  It seems that OLIVE was the only exception.

This book has good bones.  The story, unfortunately underdeveloped, could have been excellent, perhaps if written with a lighter touch and a tad more care and talent.  Instead almost everyone here was an exaggerated caricature and the story was predictable and exasperating.  For example, how unkind and mean-spirited can one family be?  Based on the Crawford family here, the answer is limitless unkindness and meanness.  And how stupid and spineless can one heroine be?  Based on Julia here, the answer is limitless spinelessness and stupidity.

The hero was 90% OK except for his one big moment of failure.  The mistaken identity and subsequent wrong couples paired at the beginning was not used to any advantage, the city girl acclimating to country life was underdeveloped, and, frankly speaking, I didn't like anyone in the Crawford family, including the heroine.  The hero deserved someone with more sense and more spine.

I could actually see the house in  all its minimalism -- the ""flying staircase"" (I've actually seen one of those) and the buff colored stone - the kind of bareness that affects the mood, that brings a sort of tranquility along with it - or as  an alternative.....brings a creepy unease.

Some reviewers have criticized the book for the ""dumb"" tenants - namely, two women tenants - who accepted the strange list of ""RULES"" put in place by the owner-landlord, who is also the architect of the house.  But I accepted the premise in that ONLY TWO women throughout the story were involved.  I could imagine that in a population of apartment-seekers, TWO (and at different times) would be willing to say ""OK  - I won't leave things on the floor. And ok, also for a few other stipulations:  ""No clotheslines. No wastepaper baskets.  No smoking.  No coasters or placements. No cushions, no knickknacks..."" Actually, that is going a bit into the area of ""strange.""

So we have here a sort of ""Modern Gothic"" tale, that smooths and polishes the stones of the House of Usher, turning it into ""One Folgate Street, London,"" and transforms strange Roderick into stranger-yet Edward Monkford (LOVE the name), the world-renowned architect.

[The name ""MONKFORD"" brought to my mind - monks living in a Spartan monastery .... the image is there, with the name.]

And who is this architect really? Is he mad?  Well, possibly yes, thinks the Reader.  OR - he may not be truly mad.  OR - he may not be truly murderous (or maybe he is?) - but certainly he has his share of idiosyncratic tendencies.  And the Reader cannot stop reading because all of the options just tangle as the story moves forward.

This story was just as strange and intriguing as psychological fiction can get, when enhanced by and blended with the creepiness of gothic. Fans of the Strange:  Read and enjoy!

My rating says 5 STARS - but I feel I must take off half a star for the syrupy ending.  Oh, after the cool bare floors and walls, we run into the gooey-ness of those last few pages?

I am all about watching a different kind of sci-fi movie and this movie's premise and trailer interested me enough to make me watch.  It had flashes of similarities to a similar story line of ""Hunger Games"" or ""Divergent"" yet had a unique enough premise to draw me into it to watch.

Unfortunately this movie fails to live up to what it promises.  I can get past the whole train setting as kind of nonsensical in the first place but this movie the script itself wanders off the track too many times that it derailed to me early on.  Sometimes books don't translate well into movies and although maybe my lack of familiarity with this story makes it a difficult translation to me, I don't know.  I would just hope that the book has a more cohesive story that what the movie showed.  It is almost that the movie tries too hard to stray out into weirdness territory just to be different.  The basic story is there and underneath the layers it has a lot of potential to be good, but the strange action sequences, weird dialogue and shaky camera shot sequences just left me more annoyed than amused.

This is going to be a movie that some people are going to like for sure with its off center storyline and overall strange feel. It has its messages that it is trying to send, but like the translator in the movie, it didn't get the message very clear to me. I will give it credit for being original and different as for sure that is it what it was.  If you are looking for something out of the norm of the standard type sci-fi then this you may enjoy.  For me, this isn't a terrible film as movie starts to get interesting toward the end but the movie is really hard for me to rate as there were so many things, especially early on that made me dislike the film.",1,"[-2.165004915276792, 1.1856514255761321, -1.9753644618166475, -1.0794071176880313, -1.9005209142323591]",1.1856514255761321

While the plot is far from complex, its setting is an intriguing one--New Orleans in the latter part of the 20th Century with a hurricane brewing.  One might think that race would be a major element in the story, but it plays only a minor part, with the players only occasionally racially identified.

As always Dani starts out with action that throws you right into the plot!  Twists abound in the mystery surrounding Kirra's family!  I REALLY love how Reef's character grew into an awesome Christian man!  As the baby and wild child in the bunch I absolutely LOVE where he ends up!  And Kirra, who had already become a favorite character of mine from the last book, is an amazing character that overcomes hardship and heartache and who learns to heal!  All of my favorite characters come back as the McKennas band together to solve their final mystery!  Using the Iditarod for a backdrop Dani's writing is so expressive there were times I had to stop reading before I got frostbite! LOL!  I LOVE the messages of Faith and love, I enjoyed the suspense and mystery, and as always I adore the characters!  Fast paced and filled with great scenes, it makes me wish this wasn't the end!  I wouldn't mind if Dani comes out with another book with all of these characters centering more around any kids they might have...hint hint Dani! ;) LOL!  Overall this is a fabulous series filled with action and adventure that shouldn't be missed!

I think this is the song that goes with Kirra in the end""You Carry Me"" by Moriah Peters

2173,"The Letters took me longer to get into than some of Fisher's other books - and the ""feel"" of it was different than her other series, at least in my mind. It's kind of a quiet story about especially quirky characters...but even though they took longer to win me over than I expected, win me over they did.

When I started the book, I was less than impressed. I honestly don't know how much of it was my mood and how much of it was a change in Fisher's writing style (or, more likely, a view of it I just hadn't seen before). The writing seemed choppy and slightly juvenile. While I felt bad for what the characters were going through, I didn't feel overly invested in their lives. Some were sweet, but they either came across as unoriginal or overly quirky.

I kept reading. Little moments elicited chuckles from me. Scenes started to weave together into a bigger picture. Familiar faces dawned on me far later than they did for many other fans, I'm sure, but it was kind of fun to be surprised! And, while the story didn't turn out to be a complete favorite for me, I found myself touched by the gentle lessons and the bonds these characters forged.

The title is a bit misleading, as letters don't play as prominent a role as it might suggest (although that doesn't mean their role isn't important). But if you're looking for a getaway to find some perspective, consider taking a visit to The Inn at Eagle House. You'll be reminded of the joys of love and family, and the peace that comes in knowing you're not alone. And for those who like interconnected books, Fisher just keeps adding layers to the stories and characters she's written, with the promise of more to come!

2 out of 5 Stars

What to say? The story was ok, the suspense was non-existent because I knew who was involved upon meeting the characters and the sex was worked into the story very smoothly and pretty graphic. The overall plot was choppy and predictable, for example what did Helene have to do with the story, of course Miles and Karolin were involved in Lars and Faye's death, and Adelia is absolutely naive and unaware of people's ""vibes"" if she didn't get that Karolin didn't give a crap for her or if she honestly believed that Miles was a good man.

Overall it could have been more interesting if Miles wasn't so involved with Karolin's plan or if David wasn't so obvious as a mate for Adelia from the beginning.

9388,"I remember when this book came out, and I was amazed that kids were lining up to read a 1000+ page novel!! (I have to admit I was right there in line with them), and while I read the novel, I kept wondering just how in the world they would ever be able to make a film adaptation. The novel is PACKED with tons of new characters, the Quidditch World Cup, the Tri-Wizard tournament.....just tons of stuff, and I thought for sure it would have to be split into two films. When I found out that ""Goblet of Fire"" was going to be a single film, with a running time similar to the earlier films in the series, I figured they would be cutting the story to the bone, and was prepared to be disappointed in the movie.

I will say that they story is cut way, way down. We go from the opening at the Riddle house to the Weasley household to the World Cup to Hogwarts within the first 10 - 15 minutes of the film. What took a few hundred pages in the novel takes up almost no screen time. The storytelling in the film is crisp and while huge sections of the novel are glossed over or left out completely, the film is very entertaining and coherent, but quite a bit of character building is lost in the process. The leads get their time to shine, but the supporting case doesn't get to do a whole lot. Snape is relegated to the background for most of the film, and Rickman's portrayal of the Potions Professor as been a highlight of the series so far. We don't really get to know the other competitors in the Tri-Wizard Tournament either, specifically Cedric Diggory. It's a shame that we can't really get invested in these characters as they play such a vital role in the overall story. The F/X again are top notch, and again the three leads really feel natural in the roles now, they've made these characters their own, and it shows.

I really think this film should've been split into two movies. There is just so much lost in the transition from Page to Screen, that while this film does feel complete, fans of the series know there was a much bigger, and better story to tell. As it is, ""Goblet of Fire"" is a good movie, but it's not a great movie.",1,"[-2.7650207610190742, 1.1740638149058924, -2.5910636053316107, -1.1057252408239817, -0.7803185030531865]",1.1740638149058924

First off, if you don't like other seaweed snacks, stay away from these.  The seaweed snack flavor is there and it is strong.  But, if you're like me, you've eaten seaweed snacks and thought they were all right, but maybe were left thinking they were lacking in substance (those strips are THIN and lightweight).  These offer a solution to that problem.  They are a layer of seaweed snack attached to something like a rice cracker.  The cracker part gives substance where the seaweed alone wouldn't have it, and the flavors are complementary.

You can see the full nutrition facts panel and ingredients list if you zoom in on the image of the back of the package.  The first ingredient in these is tapioca starch and they thus have 14 grams of processed starch in an 18 gram serving.  Other nutritionals are not particularly interesting; as you might expect, there's some sodium (190 mg, or about 8% if you are on a 2000 calorie diet).  These are basically empty calories, but in fairness, one serving is only 80 calories, which is on the low side.  (As an aside, the package is not resealable, which is a little irritating since there are two servings in a single package.)

The texture of these is quite nice and because of the added rice cracker part, you do feel like you are getting a substantial snack (unlike with plain seaweed strips).  The flavor is complex but definitely in the range of what you will expect from a seaweed snack.  (Random bit of information: don't eat these when you have a horrible cold and lots of congestion, as they just taste fishy then, even though there is no fish in them.  Learn from my mistake.)

I am trying to eat more green things and I know seaweed has lots of nutrients like iodine and other minerals that may not show up on the nutrition label because they're not mandated to be there, and I did enjoy eating these.  As part of an overall balanced diet with lots of fiber and such, these snacks should be just fine for most people to consume fairly regularly.",1,"[-1.7138971388707231, 1.167121893543527, -2.021160770561214, -1.0471648401506313, -1.856373416204241]",1.167121893543527

5242,"The time travel clock ticks ever so slowly in this one, my fellow romance book loving friends. Though at first I was intrigued by the concept and the characters backgrounds, I found myself frustrated at the snail, slow pace in the first half of this book. As an avid romantic at heart, Im usually very patient when it comes to waiting for the main couple to get tangled up in the sheets, mostly because I prefer a strong, established emotional connection to take place first. However, a considerable amount of time was spent on the ins and outs of Regan and her relatives ghostly gifts and Faelan fumbling around trying to convince Regan to recognize he did really need her to break a curse some may feel he earned.

At nearly 30% into it, when a windy explanation with even more details about gravity, magnetism, realms, solstices and equinoxes was presented to try to lend some credibility to this fictitious scenario, I seriously started to question whether I was wasting my time and if I should just give up the ghost and move on to my next romantic read.

At 62%, when after two big reveals and a task assigned to Regan that did not sit well with me, I found myself not wanting to suffer through how it all works out just to get to a HEA. I actually did push onward until 85%, and it still didn't get any better for me, folks.

Heres to hoping others enjoy it. I just didn't overly enjoy the authors direction or delivery of this particular storyline.

Title: Tangled in Time, Author: Barbara Longley, Pages: 268, stand-alone, paranormal, former bed hopping, manho hero, didn't know he was a daddy, likely deserved to be cursed, didn't really enjoy it.

The action and the thriller part were practically non-existent.  There were several opportunities for great action, but they were spoiled by the author skipping the action part and having the characters mostly describe what happened.  I WANT TO READ THE ACTION!  The main character had potential.  But this potential didn't develop because I was so distracted by the comedy that the author tried to insert and that fell totally flat for me.  I was also distracted by the romantic shenanigans by several of the characters.  I mean really, characters meet, fall in love, and plan to marry all within this ""action thriller""?  And thriller?  I think NOT  I definitely wasn't thrilled by any of the action, character development, or plot.  I was not invested in the characters.  I didn't worry about them being in peril.  And really!  Cold Mountain?  This nickname for the main character got REALLY annoying!  Will I read this author again?  Not likely.

""Scat"" was my one, and only, foray into Hiaasen's young adult literature and I was sorely disappointed. I imagine this book would not entertain a bright kid. The characterizations are weak, the plot is absolutely ridiculous, and the author tries (unsuccessfully) to pander to his audience. The novel is filled to the brim with references to the latest pop technology (Facebook, YouTube, texting, iPods, etc.) and it gets nauseating. It comes across like the stereotypical geezer trying to relate to those ""darn kids and their rock and roll"". It seems forced, and as a result, ineffective. There is also a lame attempt to integrate the Iraq War and a not very subtle environmental message. It comes across as cloying and obvious, and as I mentioned earlier, a halfway sophisticated young reader will not buy it!
I would recommend you sending the kids to other authors, and letting them come to Hiaasen's adult work later in life.

The fact that Peyton's destination was Disney Land was both cute and funny.  It added a light-hearted element to the story. Because of course, everyone wants to go to Disney Land, even if the world did end.

Getting back to the action, there was not enough of it. The action scenes were quick and exciting, but there was a serious lack of overall action. The story could have supported a lot more. The ending was a letdown, with the lack of action showing through.

This is a heavily assigned novel, or rather a collection of vignettes, related to the American experience in the Vietnam War. The author writes of a character, with the name Tim O'Brien, but not autobiographically, considering his options, being in the war, killing, and returning home a changed man. There's a detachment of the characters and their narrative that is quite disconcerting and which stands in marked contrast to the novels of earlier wars (All Quiet on the Western Front or The Thin Red Line for example). The sparseness and remoteness of the text have been likened to post-traumatic stress-disorder, and to the dehumanizing aspects of modern war and the training for modern war.

The magical realism of Going After Caccaiato is, I think, a better novel, but this is what has been anointed as the definitive American novel of the Vietnam War.

K Webster has managed to not only write one of the most unique and thrilling plots I have ever read, but she incorporated beauty into such an ugly world.

Yes, with the death of Yoda in the third film 'Return of the Jedi' released in '83 the best part of the storyline died with him. To make matters worse in come those furry little Ewoks to replace him.

5763,"This is a story about a set coordinator (Abby)(BTW, does a job like that even exist?), and a Sky Marshall (Gage), who end up on the same flight to New York and get snowed in for two nights in a Penthouse that Abby is researching for the set company she works for.

So for the first part of this book, I was really enjoying it. Funny, witty characters, and the mile high club in the making was pretty interesting and entertaining too. But at about the half way mark in the book, you kind of began to get tired of the statement ""it's only a one night stand, doesn't mean anything"".  It also seemed like the characters started to have some disconnect from when the story started out. Just started getting confusing on how the characters were being portrayed, which was a bit disappointing because I was really enjoying the book up until that began. I really liked the horse carriage scene. Gage is pretty dang hot, and given he's a great uncle, he was even a bigger draw. Was a bit weirded out on how he would talk about his niece though, was almost like she was his daughter, but she wasn't. Book was entertaining, but could have definitely been better.

1070,"It had its' good parts and its' bad. The bad was that he spent the first 1/2 thinking about the woman he had loved before his accident. I cannot stand those who have loved before. I am not sure if he was really in love like he thought or was just in the moment back then and really loved the heroine. Loving someone with ""all your heart"" that is not the heroine or hero, negates the love that I am supposed to be reading about. It makes it feel fake and that ruins a book for me. The OW left him when he was hurt and he turned off his heart to another. She never made a reappearance and her name was not mentioned in the last 1/2. Nothing was resolved about her, it was just he loved her and she left him. I do not like that at all. Also, the heroine mentioned having met a man she thought she wanted to be with before the car explosion happened. You never learn anything more than that alone. It was an empty, throw away statement that was unneeded. I do not feel love but a mutual liking and respect between these characters. They make great friends and potential lovers but I was not into their romance. Towards the end, there were a lot of sappy speeches that did not meet my expectations. Also, his argument to drive her away was about as convincing as my 5 year old telling me he does not like me anymore because I will not buy him candy. The heroine actually cried over his ""harsh"" words...that was pathetic in itself. Anyways, I like this author a lot but this book was only just okay for me.

579,"Reading this book was a very unique experience, and I give Mr. Martel props for his interesting style and format of the novel, if for no other reason. I enjoyed the book while reading it, was not bored by it, and yet when I was done I was not blown away as I expected to be.
First off, it is not a good idea to read this book because you loved ""Life of Pi"". It is not that text, and to expect it to be is patently unfair. Secondly, the reviews on Amazon trashing the writing of the book are absurd. Mr. Martel is clearly a proven gifted writer. To say he isn't is ridiculous.
The book is an allegory about the Holocaust, and deals with a famous writer and a very talented taxidermist. I won't go into any other plot points here, but I will say that Martel successfully interweaves elements of absurdist theatre, allegory, extended metaphor, philosophy, theology, and existentialism into an entertaining work. That is no small feat. And the book is only about 200 pages long! I am loathe to write much more about the novel as one needs to be familiar with it, to understand any honest evaluation of it.
Frankly, I think this text would best be enjoyed by a group and I heartily recommend it for book clubs. It will give you much to digest and talk about, regardless of positive or negative. I also think it is best absorbed when one can discuss its many aspects with another person. As I talked about the book with others and we compared perspectives and analysis the text became a richer experience.
One huge quibble I have with the text is that the ""big reveal"" of the book is not that big a reveal at all. You would have to be clueless not to see where the novel is going by the time you hit page 100.  The obvious impending conclusion does detract from the work a little. Still, Martel manages to make the journey thought provoking and interesting.",1,"[-2.369621541726948, 1.1243632978156706, -2.469743417636887, -1.1116411944090083, -0.8610441837673808]",1.1243632978156706

An interesting story told from two points of view.  Sometimes that can be distracting or annoying, but in this case, it really worked.  Mainly, I think, because Grants telling merely filled in the gaps, rather than being an entire re-hashing of the story.

First, the book is based post zombie apocalypse...with vampires. Hell yea, amirite? People in a horrible world, just trying to survive with the help of a treaty with Vampires to protect them on their hunts in return allowing the vamps to feed on them.

The storyline was good, rather enjoyable actually. But at times the writing felt juvenile...I was certain it was the authors first book (but it's not, I checked.) The relationship between characters were rushed: there wasn't a slow build for any of them. No descriptions of characters, memories to play off of, just a rush to get to where the story wanted to go.

This is a story of struggle and perseverance, and the good guys don't really win. I found myself rooting for her, even though I knew the outcome.

It is so frustrating that so many people were working against Debbie's dream of a museum to feature her memorabilia collection. Wouldn't a Hollywood museum have been a great attraction? Why are there so many morons out there who don't appreciate movie history?

Aside from featuring the rest of the story (so far), this book has a great finish: Debbie recounts her experiences working on each of her movies. This was something that I felt was missing from her first book which highlighted the major films, but not the minor ones.

I thought Becca and Colin would have a smoldering forbidden sort of romance with her being engaged but instead of getting that, it fell flat. I usually don't like when the heroine is with someone else while falling for the Hero but in most cases the connection is stronger than the one built with the other guy and you just want them to be together! What I hate is when it takes the entire story to bring them together...as is the case with this one. Waiting until the final chapter for the heroine to get her head out of her behind and figure out her fiance is a jerk and that she's in love with the Hero is not what I call an endearing romance. It's maddening actually. It's frustrating and unnecessary to wait that long. Especially when you add a few chapters from the fiance's POV showing EXACTLY what kind of jerk he is!

Even more enraging is only having the Hero and heroine share one kiss while detailing the fiance's crappy behavior in several instances. Why would you even do that? Showing things from his perspective only made you hate him (which I already did) and added nothing to the overall story because the heroine never finds out his secrets! Here I was, thinking that I'd get my ""A-HA!"" moment where she walks in on him, but no! That didn't happen either. Total let down for me, a woman who loves a good comeuppance revenge moment. *sigh* I'd probably have given this 2 stars had it not been for the sweet way things turned out for the previous couple Will and Annie.

This is yet another well written and plotted story from an author that is very new to me and that I seriously think will be someone who I must read, no matter what.

Her stories are fresh, poignant and extremely real. She thrives on creating characters that are flawed, yet redeemable in the readers eyes. I like the fact that Ms. Grant takes chances with creating characters who are unique and who you may not like at first, yet they are interesting and entertaining. They are meant to make me think and mull over the reasons behind the choices they make.

Both Kate and Nick had to work hard for me to like them, and in the end I did. I questioned many decisions these two made and I had a blast finding out what made them tick.

Like the annoying neighbor who traps the main character in his driveway over and over again, I went into each scene wondering if anything was going to make me laugh.

Jason Bateman's character is nearly vacant enough for Paul Rudd to play.  He owns a company and he doesn't get much from his wife...basically, he's a normal schmuck who isn't all that interesting.  He employs bickering employees who aren't that interesting either.  You would not want to hang with any of these people during or after work.  Milas Kunis is a smokin' hot chick but she's such a despicable person, stealing and scamming from everyone in her path, that I hated her.  So what that she's hot?  Was her hotness supposed to offset what a terrible person she really is?

Ben Affleck plays a shaggy, stupid bartender who somehow tends bar in a Marriott or some upscale place--obviously a place that would never hire an unkempt moron like him.

There's a workplace plot that involves a character getting his privates mutilated and the impending lawsuit that could upset the sale of the company.  Then there's a domestic plotline of a husband setting his wife up for adultery that has absolutely nothing to do with the workplace plotline...and none of this would matter if the film was remotely funny.

You'll see a lot of good reviews here but look for the key words, like ""understated.""  That means that the movie is ""not funny.""  ""Subtle.""  ""Not funny.""

1197,"It took me 1/3 of the book to finally liking it.  Perhaps it was because the author read the book herself.  Her voice is not professional therefore the book suffers from a monotone at times and whine at times.  Once I got used to her voice.  I started to like the book better.

The pros:
1. she's brave in examining her own skeleton.  I don't think she was lost or promiscuous in her 20s and 30s.  Like most young women, she's search for identity and finding her own path.
2. she's good at analysis; her own mind and the minds of her 5 women.
3. she's intelligent, which is obvious in her word choices.  Although the big words she's fond of using can feel too pompous at times.
4. I find it refreshing to mix autobiography with biographies of others.  She jumps from her own life and feeling to correlate with her 5 female subjects.  It makes a rather interesting read.

The cons:
1. she can come across as lost and whiny at times; a privileged person having first world problems.  thankfully her candor saves the book from being unreadable.
2. she adores her 5 female subjects therefore I get a feeling that her assessment was rather biased at times
3. the book needs a better editor.  It can loose about 1/5 to make it tighter and more cohesive.
4. The title ""Spinster"" is misleading.  It's not really about being a spinster but being a woman in search of her own life and identity apart from the typical societal roles assigned to women.

Ms Bolick is an introspective and intelligent woman.  I don't think we should be too harsh to judge this book.  With time and aging, I am sure she will blossom into a better writer.  I do hope that she would write a followup to Spinster when she's 65 or 70.",1,"[-0.9769679438505832, 1.0881736760590903, -2.4766844841342266, -1.0849247399440998, -1.724320243091825]",1.0881736760590903

Not only it is good for deodorizing refrigerators and freezers, I know smokers who put it in their ashtrays to help control the stink from cigarettes.  I've mixed it with lemon juice to scour pots and pans.  It's a very useful product which I heartily recommend.

58,"My review is based on my purchase of the CD.  As much as I wanted to give 5 stars for the content and insights, the reader was so subpar that I could not.

Advertisers have known all along that economic decisions are often heavily based on social, cognitive and emotional factors.  We can know too.  Author Dan Ariely gave incredible insights into ways that people commonly make irrational decisions.  Sure they were based on college experiments, but we learn a lot about ourselves from the results and Ariely's interpretations.

From knowledge gained studying irrational decision-making, I wonder to what extent we can rationalize behavior.  It seems the complexity of decision-making might be increasing, and the irrational biases are apparently hardwired.  For example, even though we know based on Ariely's research that we put energy into being penny wise and pound foolish regarding certain purchases, it seems likely that smart people will continue to do so.

The solutions posed in the book are really separate from the value of the knowledge gained.  Obviously, government has a legitimate role in consumer protection.  Consumers, working constantly and with no time to research the fine print of every type of deal, should be protected to some extent.  Even so, there is no way government can protect citizens from every pitfall.  It makes me wonder if a type of training could be devised to help me, and all of us, override most irrational impacts on decision-making.",0,"[1.0697247796808824, 0.5042336129876587, -2.499624272834316, -1.0490923055036097, -1.4497494575431724]",1.0697247796808824

3138,"Perhaps if I had known what to expect of Laura Ingraham's Of Thee I Zing: America's Cultural Decline from Muffin Tops to Body Shots, I would have been less disappointed.  Based on the subtitle, you know there's going to be some humor here.  But this is really her attempt at stand-up comedy (on paper).  You know those comedians whose wry, observational humor is fun to listen to for a half hour or so?  It's funny to commiserate with them about the stupid, annoying things people do.  But Ingraham takes this basic idea, recycles it through a variety of themes, and comes off sounding like a whiny, elitist bore.

It's not that she didn't make me laugh occasionally, and it's not that I didn't share some of her contempt, but she just got to be dull and grating after a while.  Have you ever had a friend with lots of pet peeves, and at first when he's talking about them, you nod and laugh and say ""Yes! I know exactly what you mean!""  But then when that's all he talks about, and just won't shut up, you really don't want to be around him any more.

That's how Laura Ingraham is in Of Thee I Zing.  She is perfect.  Everyone else in the world is just about intolerable.  Good luck getting through this one.",1,"[-0.07439602755489028, 1.0688791672544742, -2.6546364846369883, -1.0717524751672742, -1.455261641947298]",1.0688791672544742

The cool part about this book and what sets it apart from other romance books is that it is all told in the guys point of view. I actually really enjoyed hearing the book from his point of view. I didn't agree with some of the stuff that was said by Cade. It wasn't his talking per se but what he was thinking. I found it unrealistic that he would be so sensitive to Hannah. You can tell that in his thoughts that it was a guy talking but it was what a woman would want him to think and feel. I don't believe that to be that case in real life. I also don't believe that he would have waited as long as they have to have sex (which still hasn't happened). I know this book is fiction and I shouldn't compare it to real life but if you are gonna have the perception from the guys point of view, you need to be able to actually sound like a guy and not a guy written from a female.

3659,"This review is for the Zero Sum Trilogy.  I read book one of the Trilogy without realizing there were more books in the series.  I was unhappy that book one ended without a resolution - only directions to the next book.  Out of disgust, I wrote off the book until I found the entire series available for free for Amazon Prime members.  Hooray for Amazon.  Since book one was so good, I re-evaluated and got the series.

I have now read the last 2 books of the trilogy and have reassessed the trilogy.  My initial 4 star review has been lowered to 3 stars.  The book devolved into a shallow romance story with repetitive bits happening as Stephen (whatever his last name at the time) and Antonia flitting from country to country.  I lost my interest in the story which is unfortunate.  I have read Russell Blake books before and have thought much better of his writing.

2272,"About 5% of this book is straight memoir. Another 90% is a shaggy dog story told in first person and involving people and some events in Norm Macdonald's life, and the rest is a kind of post-modern wrapping involving commentary from Macdonald's supposed ghostwriter, who has grown to loathe Macdonald and wants the reader to know it.

The parts don't all mix well. MacDonald is famous enough that people will know the highlights of his career  Saturday Night Live, Dirty Work, the Norm Show, but not famous enough for people to know whether or not he's joking when he describes some very dark elements in his childhood, we don't know whether or not he's serious. And while the very idea that child molestation, for example, might be a subject for humor is typical for Macdonald, it doesn't work well in print.

Best sections of the book: a role-reversed description of Macdonald's firing from Saturday Night Live, a catalog of his favorite lines from Weekend Update (one classic from Chevy Chase and the rest Norm's own), and an ironically exaggerated description of Norm's defeat on the television program Star Search in 1990. The book visits some territory familiar from his previous work, including gambling, meeting Satan, and a bit of gay panic.

Even for fans of Macdonald, this might have been best as two books  one with the shaggy dog material and the other more purely factual. The postmodern commentary could go with either, or both.",1,"[-1.0520013719081782, 1.0509167667321706, -2.4774198945431576, -1.041258799361787, -1.9682667134927647]",1.0509167667321706

861,"UPDATED REVIEW:

I wrote the review below a week or so ago.  However, on reflection, I've decided that the book merits at least 4.5 or 4.75 stars rather than the 3.5/3.75 I previously gave it.  The more I think about it, the better the writing is, and while I'm still a bit troubled by the items mentioned in my initial review, I think I was too harsh.  Also, my wife (whose judgments do influence me) read it and thought it was wonderful.

INITIAL REVIEW:

I've never read any of Kate Atkinson's other books, but the reviews on Amazon and elsewhere contained so many favorable comments on her writing that I decided this was a good one to try.

The comments about her writing are correct.  Her writing is wonderful - her characters are vivid, her dialogue is crisp, and the atmosphere she creates seems to depict England through the two World Wars and beyond enormously effectively.  In fact, while this book has not been described as historical fiction, it certainly qualifies as such.  And the alternative versions of the heroine's lives (and deaths) really didn't bother me; in fact, I think it was a brilliant device to show not only how different choices can have long-lasting effects, but also to show the different aspects of Ursula's personality.  The book was a surprisingly easy and pleasurable read.

However, I share the views of other reviewers who have asked what the point is.  The book reminded me of some works of art in which I am in awe of the technique but don't quite get the point.  In particular, the last few ""chapters"" seemed to be somewhat randomly selected and made me wonder if Atkinson was trying to prove little more than her ability to manipulate the reader (i.e., to make the reader seem a bit dense or even stupid).  I don't think so, but it's too bad that the question was raised in my mind.

In view of my concerns, I don't think the book necessarily deserves four stars; however, it's a strong 3.5 or even a 3.75, so I'm rounding up.  At a minimum, I'd have to say that it's worth reading.",1,"[-2.3214023145588696, 1.041753005198756, -2.1352052275741844, -1.0798781163337985, -1.8359221002770116]",1.041753005198756

The big appeal with these are the smell.  I found four of the markers very appealing, one okay and one not so appealing. The Hot Buttery Popcorn, Watermelon, Raspberry and Mint Chocolate all smell like their names indicate. They actually make me hungry.  The Root Beer smells a little like root beer and is okay to smell but it does not come close to the four scents I just mentioned.  The Nacho Cheese smells unpleasant to me. It has a bit of a nacho smell but I find it has an unpleasant odor.

The product description on the Amazon web page say these are AP certified, non toxic.  This is important to me since adults and children will want to sniff these.

All the markers draw/write well.  The angled chiseled tip allows for sharp lines as well as wide lines. They have not bled through any paper I have used.  The colors included are black, yellow, pink, blue, orange and brown.

These are fine markers. I gave these four stars because I only found four of the six scents actually matched their description when it came to their scent.

3059,"I agree with the other reviewers that this book is not up to the authors' usual standard.  There does not seem to be a ""main"" plot; the focus of the story is giving backstory to the other Nina Reilly books.  It's like one long chapter in a book-to-come. It did make for a pleasant evening's reading, though.

I agree with the reviewer who could not recognize Nina.  Usually I find her a little too cold and hard for my taste; here she exhibits superhuman stamina, but way too much emotion.  It's a little harsh to say she acts like she's in heat, but she does seem surprisingly interested in sex for someone as exhausted as she must be.

More importantly, I cannot believe that a woman as intelligent as Nina could ""accidentally"" become pregnant in the 1990s.  Affordable, efficient birth control has been easy to come by for DECADES; I do not think the accidental pregnancy plot is acceptable any more without a pretty strong story explaining how it could happen -- like maybe a poor teenager from a fiercely religious background and a weak self-image.  But NINA?? No way.  And we're supposed to think that she carried on a relationship with Filsen and others with no birth control?  uh-uh.

1902,"I picked this up, primarily based on the title. I am a student of WWII history/Europe. I did not read it as a documentary, so opine it was a work of historical fiction. The story line was essentially about the efforts of the French resistance in locating and then aiding allied military located behind German lines to escape from occupied France.
I don't re tell story lines in my reviews, but suffice it to say there was nothing in the narrative that would constitute a ***spoiler alert** anyway. There was some character development of the leading protagonist, but nothing particularly note worthy. The writing was okay, I thought perhaps a bit juvenile, high school level, perhaps.
There was some intrigue, particularly when the Gestapo were involved, but again, nothing bloody that I noticed. There really was not a lot of detail as how the allied military were rescued and returned, hence, as l say, more a work of fiction of how the repatriations were carried out.

7098,"Given the reknown and accolades, I owed it to myself to give Umberto Eco a read.  Perhaps this was not a good first choice (I will try another), but I found _The Prague Cemetery_ to be confusing, tedious and a struggle to stay interested.  I rarely quit reading a book mid-way through, but I did so in this case.

The book is a series of diary entries, the identity of the protagonist is difficult to determine: he either suffers from multiple personality disorder or is merely having a laugh at our expense - it was never clear to me (even after reading the first 120 pages).  To complicate matters further, Eco jumps around in time, adding a whole other level of confusion and mystery to who our narrator is and what he's on about.

In spite of my struggles and ultimate failure to finish the book, it is clearly apparent that Eco is a gifted writer.  The voice(s) of Simonini are witty - funny, even, as he is abrasive, cantankerous, deeply mysogynisitc and prejudiced against all manner of people from the French to the Freemasons to Jesuitis - yet in spite of these repugnant character traits, he is not without some redeeming features.  This is no easy feat for a writer to pull off, and Eco does so masterfully.

I am disappointed in my choice, but will absolutely give Eco another chance.  It seems, sadly, that _The Prague Cemetery_ was just not a good choice for an introduction to Eco's writing.",1,"[-2.300026265372929, 1.0197814242121308, -2.782788022929273, -1.0886092492102968, -1.7991511359948862]",1.0197814242121308

They are soul mates but life is making it so hard to believe in that, it rips at their fondation of love.

I liked the sound of the book and was quick to read it when I got it from the author. However, within the first couple of chapters I knew that I was in big trouble. Maybe it's because I am 25 and this book is geared toward someone in their early teens? I found the dialogue to be quite lacking and it just didn't seem like something someone would normally say. The majority of the dialogue between Michael and Claudia was overkill on the sweet talk, for example... ""You're doing it again. Melting my heart with your smile."" I just could not get into the author's writing style. She paid great attention to detail and even to small talk and I think that is what got me. I like it when an author is short and sweet and gets to the point. Details are great and I love to see the world that the author envisioned but there is a fine line between informed and information overload.

I wish I could say that I enjoyed this book and I tried to find an angle of the story that I liked but the only two things I liked about this book was the idea and the cover. Like I said, maybe I am too old for the age group. Would I allow my 12 year old niece to read this, yes because there is no swearing, Claudia is highly respectable to her elders, smoking and drinking is heavily frowned upon and the romance is nothing but a few kisses here and there. This is a very wholesome book. If you have a young one at home that is interested in reading the new angel fad, then this is a great book for them to read.

The more David investigates the more he questions what is happening. This is a movie that had a chance to be really good. The cast is A-list and the plot is interesting. Where the movie fails is the pacing. This is just agonizingly slow that it made it really hard to pay attention to and I was really starting to drift and lose interest in. There are some interesting parts in this but a lot of the drama was lost on me because I struggled to stay involved in what was going on.

  An early scene where Jack Black teaches Cera how to pick up women by hitting them in the head with a club was clver. But sadly that's the one scene I remember being funny. Cavemen picking up women with pick-up lines of today only got small chuckles from me. Many of the other jokes are just tasteless and dumb kind of stuff that you'd expect from the Wayans.

The plot contradictory. Way out girl buys house next to gorgeous single vicar/reverend in a small country  town. W/O girl has cat, dog and every intention of settling down, but meets dishy vicar and falls for him. Dishy vicar falls for girl. After that, the girl decides that a man of God is not for her and she should hit the road again. What she was going to do with her house and animals is not explained and why she would pass up on such a scrumptious bloke is beyond me.

I won't give a spoiler, but I do think this novel could have had a much deeper thread. Hopefully, attitudes have changed even in small rural towns in the USA, but there must have been quite a harrowing transition period from when the vicar's wife was a pious, do-gooding woman who was the slave of the town to independent women who now have their own careers (vicar's are not well paid even today unless he's a Charismatic)Certainly that was the case here in Australia ""back when""

This novel follows the town division over the suitability of the minister's wife and its resolution. Peggy Webb has chosen to write a pleasant read which could have been so much more.

At first I was a little put off when by page 45 I was keeping a running total of synonyms for Penis and Breasts she had used. Barr keeps up this low brow vernacular trying to frame her characters.  After a while I was worried about what I had gotten into.  The writing is not literary and sometimes offensive...I was a little disappointed that lines from Rosencrantz and Guildenstern needed to be called out.  I was totally ready to look down my nose at this book for the several days it would take to slog through it.

But a surprising thing happened.  I started enjoying the book. It's pure entertainment that should be enjoyed for what it is.  It's Scooby Doo meets Silence of the Lambs meets Ken Burn's National Parks. It still feels like a guilty pleasure but there were passages that i had to get through before going to sleep, and jolts, and time pondering suspects.  I loved the cultural references as well as the Glen Canyon facts that were interspersed in the story. It turned out to be an easy and enjoyable romp of a read.

It says right on the box, based on the Day of the Dead.  What part is it based on, well, there are zombies.  Bub is in it as well as some of the other characters.  Other then that, not much else is the same.  The military pretty much stays together.  There is no psychological issues going on other then trying to survive a zombie attack.

If you take the movie as a zombie movie with pretty decent effects you will be happy.  If you are a purist that think a remake has to be exactly the same, you will go away unhappy.  Check out the review for a poor review.

I watch almost every zombie movie I can get my hand on.  Some are pure drek while others are enjoyable.  Seriously, this is an enjoyable movie.  Nick Cannon is pretty good contrary to what other people say and yes, there are lines in this movie that will be quoted for years to come.  Including ""Why do white people always have to split up?""

My husband will tell you that I cry easily:  if Im happy, I cry.  If Im sad, I cry.  If Im feeling patriotic, I cry.  If something is adorable, I cry.  This book had a bit of each of these.  I cried, and cried, and cried.  The lose your mascara, red nose, and red eyes kind of crying.  I only wish I could unread this story so that I could read it for the first time again.  This is one of those few that I will put on my shelf of books that I will re-read again and again.

As I was nearing the end of this book, the phone rang.  My customer asked me if I was sick.  I told her, no, I was crying.  As it turns out, she belongs to a book club.  I gave her the information for this book and she is going to suggest it for her group.  I was very happy to recommend it for them.

What we have makes no sense outside of this cabin. It defies the rules and logic we were forced to learn. Laws are being brokenall of them Im guilty of. Despite the chances were taking to be together, Im diving headfirst. I don't stop to think about repercussions or reality.

This speech pretty much explains this story without giving you any spoilers which honestly I refuse to give.  As always it's very hard to write a Webster review without spoiling things.  So I'll try to be as vague as possible..

I'd like to thank Amazon for the opportunity to review this  miraculous book that I received as a complimentary sample.

Pastor Levi Lusko has written a truly remarkable book that is very simple and beautiful in its honesty. He and his wife experienced the horrific pain of the sudden unexpected death of their beloved daughter.

We readers can be very grateful to Pastor Levi for giving us the strength and courage to go beyond our grief, no matter  the personal circumstances that brought us to this place.

In his healing, soothing words,  Pastor Levi teaches us a helpful way to allow our grief to strengthen our ability to face the many challenges of life. The book is written plainly and kindly.  The reader will no doubt appreciate the organization of this book into discrete chapters that focus on a specific theme (e.g. ""Pain is a Microphone"", ""Run Towards the Roar"").  Throughout the book,
one finds hope and inspiration and helpful ideas that enable us to find solutions to our problems.

As unique as we all are, we do share many things in common.  Most people do have it within themselves to meet challenges as they come. But clearly, sometimes it can be overwhelming and we might not see so clearly.  Pastor Levi becomes both teacher and guide and empowers us as we learn from his experiences.

Through The Eyes Of A Lion may be helpful reading for someone you know well who is confronting obstacles in their life. Certainly, it is inspirational and helpful on many levels.

This is a remarkable book. The lessons and insights contained within stay with you. You may reach for this book time and again.",4,"[-3.5320132677335416, -2.122682357485315, -3.5277021149289594, -1.1335597167931828, 0.9868152238319339]",0.9868152238319339

Even so, I had never read one of Ian Fleming's books, prejudicialy dismissing them as childish and poorly written. After ten years, I found ""Doctor No"" in a used-books store, and since I made the mistake of thinking this was, like in the movies, the first book of the series, I bought it.
In ""Doctor No"", James Bond, after a bad mission and spending some time in a hospital, is given a kind of ""vacation mission"" in Jamaica. He has to discover what happened to the local stationed british secret agent, who is reported missing. When Bond gets there, he is driven towards Crab Key, a misterious island owned by Julius No, a tall, bald maniac for privacy and who is hiding things from jamaican administration.
To my surprise (and showing I was wrong in my prejudices), Fleming is a good writer who can hold the reader's attention at most times. It's just a pity that I didn't begin the series with the first book, ""Casino Royale"", to see how Fleming developed his writing style, characters and plots while writing the books.
Other surprise was to compare Bond in the books with Bond in the movies. Bond in the books was more human and credible, even to the point of throwing up after moments of extreme tension. Other characters are interesting as well, like nature girl Honey Rider and Bond's friend Quarrell. I also liked to meet again characters like M and Q. Doctor No, though, as everything related to Crab Key island, is a little too fantastic for my taste, but, from the information I gathered, ""Doctor No"" is Fleming's most ""exotic"" and implausible book.
The important considerations are that Fleming can create good thrilling scenes, and that James Bond is a better character than I expected. I will surely look for ""Casino Royale"" and start the series in proper order.

**Copy received in exchange for an honest review**

Where to begin? Have you ever read a book that is impossible to put into words? A book that came into your life at exactly the right time? A book that changed how you look at life? I book that you are convinced will be a New York Times best seller? Well, THIS is that book, for me? Giving it 5 stars just isn't enough! I must warn you that you WILL cry. I have actually heard people say that this is the first book that made them cry. You will cry tears of laughter, joy, and sorrow. You WILL cry!

This is a NA book, but is SO MUCH MORE! It is a romance, a book about coming of age, a book about overcoming life's obstacles, about mending relationships between a mother and daughter and a father and son, and a book with so many lessons to be learned. The most important lesson is probably to not judge a book by it's cover. Rivers and Delilah learn this only when faced with tragedy. For me, this book spoke to the motherly side of me. I am a recent empty-nester and have struggled with the relationship with my daughter. Without giving too much of this book away, I will say that I now, after many tears, look at our relationship with a different perspective.

There are some authors I admire for their clarity. They seem to think deeply at all times and make it seem so effortless. They are the authors I go to when I need clarity in my own life. Paulo Coelho has always been that author for me, but I just added Lindy Zart to that list!

Problem is Carina's mother has found out and is now forcing the two to get married.

My rating: 2 Stars

My opinion: Call me old fashioned, but I really like simple romances that are sweet, clean and based more on a blossoming love than what The Marriage Mistake was. I would sum this book up more as being an erotica book vs. a romance.

Second, I find the premise of the book totally eye rolling. Mama forces Catina and Max to marry. I think had it not have been a simple lust book and it would have been that these two were trying to emotionally getting to know each other and fall in love...I would have been a bit more accepting, but this had nothing to do with the story.

I either really like romances or really hate them. I just found this one to be really superficial and weak and needing to focus on sex to prop up a pretty weak storyline.

Julia Whelan was as good as always! I find I always enjoy her narration and this is no different. She made a great Amy and is just effortless with her storytelling.",1,"[-2.9473031271537606, 0.974878529724435, -2.5806440845267447, -1.1192635382174627, -0.7441312417387376]",0.974878529724435

Plain and simple Corin Thompson is a girl that is waiting to die. After the loss of both of her parents it turned her into a glass half empty kind of girl. She always feels like something is wrong with her even though shed been told by several doctors that it wasn't the case. Beckett is the total opposite. A lover of life, hes just trying to get back to at least half the person he once was before his heart attack.

I was honestly a little torn with this one. I thought the beginning was good, the middle OK. The last 20% made up for a lot for me. It took me longer than I would have liked to connect with these two. Beckett was a sweetie but the way Corin was initially portrayed made it hard for me to buy some of their relationship. She was a B, straight up like her sister.  I did feel bad for the hand that she was dealt but she made it hard at times to always be on her side. I didn't have an issue with the way her mind worked, it was just the way her attitude was. That ending kind of did a number on me. I didn't know which way I wanted things to go and I didn't even start to try and guess.

Overall this was a good read but a better middle would have made this an A+ for me.",1,"[-2.4043655000126964, 0.9744849705944462, -2.3872060503005805, -1.0296451038253138, -1.949186269916156]",0.9744849705944462
1932,"While the overall premise of the book was intriguing, too many irritating things kept me from enjoying it. Told in multiple POVs (I lost count after the 10th person chimed in), much of the time in the beginning I had to skim back to figure out who was who and how (if at all) they connected.

I found Carolyn, our only first person POV, to be an inconsistent character. One moment she's spouting about being an amazing lawyer and the next she's seeking counsel over general law questions any attorney should have known.

The other major issue for me was how incompetent and cold-hearted the police were portrayed as. The hurting siblings of the missing were out finding clues (with no investigative background), while the police apparently never thought to look in those places. Furthermore, they were made out to look extremely closed minded and hyper-focused on one suspect (to which each officer had a different idea as to who that was). Although police do make mistakes, I found this an unrealistic portrayal of what would happen in these circumstances.

The ending itself had a few good twists, but I felt the character development for most of the players was weak and made certain parts of the ending feel unbelievable.

I haven't read a Clark novel since high school, and I remember them being more suspenseful, but now I am thinking that may have been my young age and more innocent mind. Sadly, I found the story and the writing to be subpar to what I've come to expect out of my mysteries and thrillers. For great mysteries, I recommend Tana French, Michael Connelly, and Kathy Reichs.",1,"[-3.429810364875859, 0.9723158886461903, -2.0311726313945324, -1.0634304584343284, -2.3448953687851244]",0.9723158886461903

But . . . well, I now sympathize with my parents, who went through the same thing. I say this because this kit was incredibly easy to set up. I knew what to plug in where, all the wires where there, and everything worked on the first time. The units look nice, so they don't add to the clutter, and I've had only one small problem with the reception, which turned out to be easy to solve. I turned off everything and started again. I should say that the range between the two units is not very great, meaning only that I have not tried them too far apart.

927,"Moral ambiguity, ineffectual bureaucrats, foolish love, agents on pointless missions. These are the elements that John le Carre has worked and reworked in admirable prose and which are all in evidence in this book. lf Mr. le Carre were some other writer, I might conclude he was growing old and tired. But his characters have been from the start weary, that is part of their appeal. Part of the author's appeal is his disinclination to rely on the graphic violence that has become a staple in current suspense novels. On the negative side, no one not being paid to read by an intelligence agency is likely to take the trouble to keep track of the plethora of dreary characters.
