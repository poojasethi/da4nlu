Right out of the box, the first thing I discovered was the defective glass lid. It didn't even come close to fitting the slow cooker, and was so far off that it rattled constantly while the cooker was in use.

The next problem occurred when my wife discovered a burning rubber odor, which failed to go away after multiple uses.

The third issue was the fact that the slow cooker was never capable of fully cooking the food placed in it. My wife cooked chicken breasts, but after the suggested time was reached, the chicken pieces were still raw in the middle.

I thought that KitchenAid was a manufacturer of premium products. If this slow cooker is any indication, they certainly have a problem on their hands.

First off, the writing wasn't bad, but there were quite a few mistakes. If there was an editor, they clearly did a poor job.

Secondly, the characters weren't anything to write home about. Lyric is naive and boring. She claims to want to be a senator but she spends more time sleeping with inappropriate men than she does doing anything revolving around her ambitions. Royal is very stereotypical and macho. Nothing he did impressed me. Lyric clearly put up with far more than I would have from him. I didn't really see any chemistry between them. The sex scenes were average--definitely nothing hot enough for me to rave about, like some of the other reviewers.

The plot was boring. The author tried to cook up plenty of suspenseful plot devices, but it actually came off contrived and kind of silly. Lots of backstabbing and double-crossing and violence for the sake of violence.

I purchased it after comparison with the competitors (none existed back then) and I ordered them from an online retailer. I try them day one and they don't fit my ear well despite me trying various standardised (include) ear clips. I thought maybe this is a new concept and takes time so the one nearest to fitting, I used that for a couple of days after which I realised they are painful and must be returned besides they don't stick for long. My despair was that the website refused to accept it back saying the product works exactly like its supposed to work and they cant do anything about that. They said the fact that it doesnt feel comfy for me - is not their concern because the product is designed to be like that but they cant accept it because they cant resell it and because I cant find anything wrong with it and its working as designed. This is the first time I have been duped by a retailer online and since then I have stopped depending on them for things like refunds and warranties. Somewhere I am still under agony... I haven't even used them once and these just sit around.

Secondly,

i did try to contact Plantronics who said they don't have any further customised ear clips to send to me and said the online retailer should take them back sighting what ever differences between usability and experience.

Nothing worked.

At first glance, this movie has it all, a great cast, Ridley Scott and a tale about the consequences of greed but unfortunately even this great cast cannot save this nonsensical plot, scenes that make no sense (the Ferrari car sex scene for example) with long boring stretches of monotonous dialogue. The story isn't well developed and neither really are the characters. Unfortunately this movie raised my expectations with but instead gave me this, a clumsy suspense thriller that's lacking on suspense or thrills with way too much dialogue and too little of everything else.

There may be some that appreciate this style of film as this movie is definitely one that has that love/hate relationship with the movie goers. Although I am not really sure why some reviewers choose to be insulting to those that didn't like this film. This is the type of movie that really isn't everyone's cup of tea.

In the first book, Dons quirkiness (somewhere on the Aspergers Spectrum) was a major player in the book, but it wasn't the only player.  The other characters seemed to have more to contribute.

In this book, Dons behavior seems so forced and so contrived.  Every single thing he says and does is tainted with his quirkiness, to the point of absolute annoyance.

For example, a woman is about to breast feed her baby.  Here is the quote from the book:

The discussion was interrupted by the arrival of a nurse carrying a baby which I assumed was Sonia and Daves.  I was well aware from the Antenatal Uproar that social convention took precedence over maximizing immunity through the sharing of breast milk.

Sonia commenced the nutrition and immunity-improving process.

That last sentence was just annoying.  I cant see Don looking at every single thing like this.  I just don't remember the first book being so constantly over the top like this.

So I watched this movie.  And I have no idea what I was supposed to like about it.  Cool cars, okay.  But after about ten minutes of watching non-actors doing some non-acting (except for Warren Oates, who, well, drives a lot), I could not figure out what I was supposed to like about this movie.

I also grew up watching movies like VANISHING POINT; DIRTY MARY, CRAZY LARRY; CANNONBALL (not THE CANNONBALL RUN); AMERICAN GRAFFITI; heck, even SMOKEY & THE BANDIT...and those may have been cheap drive-in movies...but they at least DID SOMETHING.  Characters, plot, dialogue, gags, stunts.  Low-brow and obvious, but I didn't scratch my head and wondered what the heck was even going on like I did suffering through TWO LANE BLACKTOP.

So I told my LA snob friend that I didn't like the movie because mabye--just maybe--someone who's actually rode in those cars, ate in a country diner, waited on the mechanic in the rain somewhere in the Midwest--wouldn't find these scenes all that compelling.

Oh.  I get it.  There wasn't supposed to be a POINT.  That's the point!  Got it.  Well, forget that.  Where the heck is Dom DeLuise?",1,"[0.05297621669982999, 1.8059023229061388, -0.9178237262683804, -1.011923068853044, -2.3571201025800477]",1.8059023229061388

I didn't really care for the plot. It was kind of cliche, and wasn't done as well as I would've liked. I didn't connect with the characters. And all the running from feelings was annoying. It seemed more like some teenager's dream. There were some continuity issues. Like James mentioning FSU in reference to Miami (though I believe it's in Tallahassee) and then later saying University of Miami.  Also, things like being given a car, apartment, cash, etc...seems like it's against the NCAA rules, but I'm not an expert. Things like that threw me off.
Characters: C-
I didn't connect with the characters. Nadine had a hard life, but instead of being sympathetic, I was indifferent. The author didn't make us Feel what happened to her. The full story from start to finish, and not in bits and pieces might have helped.
James wasn't that great of an H. He seems too cocky. And while I usually enjoy some possessiveness, his rubbed me the wrong way. He also could have been an interesting character, overcoming adversity and whatnot, but he just seemed entitled.

This book was better than the first in the series. However, I have to say, David, toward the end of the book and the stuff that went on with his ex was soooooo dumb. Like, beyond dumb, I considered dropping this book a whole star because of it.  I didn't even start to have any problems with the book until then.
His sense of obligation even when he has no feelings for someone is quite unrealistic IMO and just plain.. as I said... stupid.
Also, in the beginning of the book David and Raymond discussed their fantasies of what they really got off on... and wanted to do sexually. We sorta saw them fulfilled but not. Because one of them wanted to screw, be filled, then return the favor. I was very disappointed that wasn't written at all.
So between David's relationship and major overthinking issues... and Raymond's lack of motivation there were parts of the book that drove me crazy.

5557,"Apparently this book follows in the great French tradition of large books.  Unlike some of those large books, this one I had a hard time getting into.  I admit that I honestly was confused from the start and that helped nothing moving forward.  There are too many non-moving parts at the beginning.  Too much background without plot.  The one thing I can attest to is that the research has been done on the author's part based on the extensive bibliography at the back.  Maybe part of the problem is that this is a translation and something is being lost for me there.  The sentences are short and choppy in construction at times which meant I skipped over whole sections without realizing it and several pages later wondered, briefly, what I missed. I also found that I could not keep the characters straight for very long.  Too many of them with names that were too unfamiliar for me even with the help of the glossary at the back.  Had this been a straight nonfiction narrative, I think it would have worked better for me personally.  The fictions of the story just aren't doing it for me.
After the second attempt at reading this, nothing was much better.  To me, this book just needs the right readers to find it.  I like my action and plot to begin when the writing begins, not halfway through the process.  The Prologue was interesting despite the fact I had no idea who ""he"" was half the time since that was a constantly shifting pronoun.  I guess I just needed more clarity at times.  But then the first chapter started and the whole experience just fell apart.  So, this one is probably more for fans of slow moving character pieces than the plot and action driven narrative.

I can definitely say that I raved about the book at the time that I was reading it (all my friends will attest to that).  The story was easy to read and I kept wondering what was really happening.  The author manages to elude to certain feelings as well as unseen thoughts that the characters (most of them) are unaware of.  This part, I thought was superbly written.  I'm not sure that another author would've been able to pull it off nearly as well.

8775,"As a huge fan of Entangled Publishing, I am always thrilled to receive an ARC e-book from them via NetGalley.  Unfortunately, the gamble I took in requesting Gambling on the Bodyguard did not pay off.  My romance book-loving friends, the author simply tried too hard on this one.  Instead of a realistic romantic tale, it came across overly sentimental with its at times stilted/overly drawn out dialog and the too frequent, overly long, sometimes even weird, racy scenes which hijacked any hope of an actual storyline. The weird comment is directed at the use of bacon and syrup, by the way. Throw in the too unlikely coincidences regarding the heroines occupation (ski instructor) and the circumstances surrounding the heros sisters death, which he blamed himself for, and I was ready to bail about 40% into it.

Wait, theres more.  The heros constant I want to be with you but you deserve someone better than me felt too sappy and redundant for this reviewer. O.K. Thats enough. There are a few more things I could mention, but I think you get the point. Since I don't like writing critical reviews, it pains me to be so brutally honest, but thats my job.  To give an honest, unbiased opinion in exchange for this ARC generously provided by this great publisher.  Unfortunately, this one just didn't work for me.

Do yourself a favor.  Consider reading Book 6 of this series, Tamed by the Outlaw by Michelle Sharp, instead. I do highly recommend that one.

7814,"At first I thought the black rubber ring that fits on the base had been heat melted and warped. Highly unlikely, but who knows. One side was higher than the other and it appeared lopsided. When I tried to push it down into the area it was supposed to go, it wouldn't fit. It wobbled and slid off. When this black ring fell to the floor upside down, I saw two little rubber prongs on the underside. Then I saw the holes on the metal base where they fit into. Perfect fit and rubber ring stays put. I still don't understand why the ring is higher on two sides and lower on the other two, Perhaps this is how it keeps the paper towels from unraveling. One handed? Yes, sometimes one sheet at a time. Heavily weighted? Yes. Even the cats can't head butt it off the counter. (Yes, they pushed the other one).  Best of all, it matches my stainless steel and black kitchen. UPDATE: 9/3/13: The black rubber piece would not stay put, but I successfully glued it to the base. The roll of towels was very loose and I could not get one towel without the whole roll spinning and unraveling. Thanks to another reviewer, I solved that problem by stuffing another towel into the shaft of the towel holder.

I know it was very popular at the time, but it still is really awful.  I had a difficult time sitting through the whole thing, and it was rather sleep inducing.  I wanted to see at least one of the Friday the 13th films, so I watched this one.  Many of the murders were ripped off from Mario Bava's superior Twitch of the Death Nerve (aka Bay of Blood), so the film wasn't even that original.  As we know, there were roughly around 1000 sequels, 500 TV shows, Jason dolls, Jason's official murder tools, Jason's hockey mask, etc., etc..  The film was one of the biggest hits of 1980, the year Hollywood started to decline.  Coincidence?  Who knows?  I just know I wasted 90 minutes of my time....",1,"[-0.4875038021969058, 1.5570548960785406, -1.2384627058649538, -1.0430517875754939, -1.3137318121549852]",1.5570548960785406

Unlivable but she wasn't really like able or fun either ........ Soo many details ,preachy and boring, we know our history ,yes, but as long as there's evil ( always will be) we will repeat it it.... I like how while Southern slavery , seemed to be at the crux of the story I did like how modern and ancient slavery was brought up as well.... I really would like to see Camille realize as bad and wrong and as evil as what happened to her great grandmother was,there's not a time or a place in r a location or a ppl that wasn't someone's slave at some point.... No a ppl on this planet want either having slaves or being enslaved themselves.....

--I now call dibbs on Slade, Cale, and Hemy!! They are MINE!!--

A man lost in his own darkness and who uses sex as a weapon to drive away his demons.

A woman with a secret who just might be the remedy he needs to see the light.

She's different than other girls. She's more than just a f*#ck. She's addictive, but the right kind of addiction.

She makes me want to be a better man; makes me want to be the old me.

Because I love it when you touch me, It makes me feel as if I'm breathing. Makes me feel...alive.

Can she be the salvation to his darkness? Will Slade overcome his past and fight for his future? And with parties breaking down all of their own rules and barriers, will their romance take flight? Or will hinderances deter them to ultimately walking away to the walk of shame?

Read and you will find out!!

He's like an addiction. Everything about him just calls out for me; my body needing him to survive.

It was unstoppable and I knew I was screwed in the best way possible. I wanted to know more. I wanted to help ease your pain. I wanted to cure you.

This man completely owns me...I am almost willing to give him everything; not just my body, but my heart.

My thoughts: It's like how I said in the beginning. This book was a fast and easy read and just captured my attention through and through.

The only downfall though is, since it is a novella, it didn't have a whole lot of plot. Otherwise, it was over all an extremely satisfying read and looks like to be a standalone for this couple I think.

I'm now tediously hoping for stories on Cale and Hemy though!! Pretty please?! Cale intrigues me and Hemy is just as bad as a man whore as Slade. I wonder what the deal is for both of them and would love to see them fall!!",4,"[-4.455866652170755, -3.306296492213401, -2.726115181512432, -1.0358802403976735, 1.526326365139101]",1.526326365139101

1. There's too many characters, and though they all intermingle eventually, you just can't keep track of all of them and their relations.
2. I can never feel for any of the characters. There's nothing there but how they handle situations. No feelings, no thinking things through. No emotions. I don't know what to think of any of them.
3. They're just plain boring. That's the only way to say it. The plots start off okay, but they just float away to other things that are of no importance that are distracting.
4. The romance is so vague. It's hardly there. No sensuousness, no passion, no nothing. It's just flat.

The prologue was great, and many of the flashbacks to Locke's childhood were interesting, but the rest of the novel was not good. The book is based on one big scam that Locke and gang are planning on a nobleman, it comes to fruition pretty early in the novel, leaving the other 3/4s of the book to throw problems and trouble in Locke's way. In addition to the plot not keeping my interest, the writing style was strange. An event would happen, then we would have to go back in time and read about how it happened, just to pick back up at the event happening. An event would happen, there would be a twist, then we have to read about how exactly the thieves accomplished the twist. Just explaining the twist was enough. I really wanted to like this book, I could have given up much earlier but since I spent so much time on it I felt compelled to finish. This book is mostly dialogue, but the characters weren't interesting enough for me to enjoy that. The capers weren't funny, fun, or exciting.

But let me say up front that perhaps that is because I had not read the books that came before and therefore I was struck by the strange parts of the story that didn't get resolved (won't put in spoilers but I am referring to all the stuff that happens to Eli's family...)  So my first recommendation is not to read this as a stand-alone because it just doesn't work unless it's a continuation of some other story.  Quite apart from that aspect, I found both H and h unbelievable:  adult platonic ""friends"" sharing a bed regularly  and being so involved in each other's sex lives felt both tacky and immature.  Then came the last 1/3rd of this novella which was just a bunch of sex scenes.  Don't get me wrong, I have no objection to sex scenes but they are usually more interesting when they are part of a  plot and/or there is a plot-related reason they are included.  At first it was interesting but I kept wondering where it was leading and the answer was nowhere that hadn't been made clear between H and h, before they eventually fell into bed together.  So, it just felt like padding.  In all, I would not recommend this novella unless you have read the earlier books in the series.",1,"[-1.4858457390935307, 1.488885601881249, -0.6684941359811161, -0.9949805739686882, -2.47544355769075]",1.488885601881249

She is able to pull you into the characters stories and tug at all your emotions. I don't believe she leaves out any emotions in her stories.

I love every character she brings us. I love love love Jet and the brother Crows! Spark has so much passion in and out of the bedroom, I was over swooning! Yes, I was on JET overload! I adored Hannah as she was the perfect heroine for this story. She is strong and unselfish. She is the melody for Jets world. These two are probably my favorite couple and the sexiest!

Now the real cutie was Alfie! He took my heart and kept it in his world. There were a few dramatic scenes and I held my breath many times over. The emotions that Spark brings you are so surreal, you feel like you are floating! Wow. I can not talk enough about this book! This book is the beginning of an amazing series that Suzie has coming up! And if you have read her Resistance series, Johnny Fn Outlaw shows up with his band mates and significant others!!!

9358,"I found this DVD is the used bin when shopping the other day, and literally for pennies (ok $3), I couldn't believe my good fortune. I immediately snapped this up of course. I hadn't seen ""Live at Pompeii"" in many, many years. I didn't even know that a new ""Director's Cut"" had been released, so I was quite intruiged by this.

""Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii"" (171 min.) starts off with the ""Director's Cut"" (91 min; in 16:9 widescreen). I was a little surprised to see all the additional space footage, I mean how weird is it to see International Space Station footage from (I'm guessing) the 1990s in a concert film that was filmed in late 71/early 72! I also couldn't quite understand the logic behind adding footage (not concert footage, even) from the band messing around at Abbey Studios on various ""Dark Side of the Moon"" material. All rather strange. The original film (60 min; in 4:3 full screen) is also included, thankfully. While I prefer watching the widescreen ""refit"", the original shorter movie makes a lot more sense musically and thematically. ""Echoes Part I"" and ""Echoes Part II"" bookend the fantastic Pompeii-filmed set.

Am I the only one to think that as it relates to the Pompeii-filmed footage, Nick Mason had an inordinate amount of screen time? I'm thinking as much as the other three combined. You can't as much as catch a glimpse of Roger Waters until well into ""Echoes Part I"" for some reason. The DVD contains a 15-20 min. interview with the director Adrian Maben, and it's interesting hearing him talk about the intent of making this the ""anti-Woodstock"" film, with no spectators instead of the ""million"" at Woodstock. In the end, contrary to some other reviewers here, I don't mind all that much that Maben made a ""Director's Cut"", since thankfully the DVD presents both the old and the new versions. In all, a must-have for any Pink Floyd fan!",1,"[-0.33025714022300123, 1.4265647276433246, -1.2506407517016846, -1.0678464044820923, -1.6112076997102056]",1.4265647276433246

In this book I found the hero too much of a villain and the female lead too weak to walk away.  Alpha heroes are great, but not when the women around them are shown as bodies to be used without much backbone or self esteem. Enough is enough.
The sex scenes are way too long, far too many words to describe in great depth what could be better handled if something were left to the readers imagination.  I can't help but wonder if her publisher gives her a minimum word count and the sex scenes are her way of coming up with the required number of words.

I was pulled in right from the beginning. Everything was so captivating and enthralling. This was so extremely well written and detailed. There was this fantastic build happening as this exciting world and all these interesting characters were introduced. Loved all the suspense! I loved Mia and Nico so much. But Mia, she was fantastic! So strong in this world where she had to fight so hard and endure so much. I just loved the strength she had and how she persevered through such a hard life. And Nico. Hello Mr. Mob Boss! He was so powerful and commanding, sexy and hot. Their chemistry together was so fantastic. It was like an electric connection. I loved their animosity and that push and pull they had with one another. I thought there was great character development and I loved watching all there drama unfold and them come together. There was conflict, ups and downs, and so much heat. It was all awesome!

This was such a fantastic introduction to the Ruin & Revenge series series. There are a lot of different characters to in play, different dynamics and things happening. It was so exciting to read and I can't wait to see what will come in future stories. So much ground work was laid and I'm hooked! I love that it was told from three different perspectives. It added such a great and intriguing layer to everything that was happening. I thought it was a really fresh element that had me rooting for everyone's HEAs.

This world was raw, gritty, and violent and in the midst of it all, there were also these wonderful moments of levity woven in that I found perfect and very needed in the midst of all the drama. I thought there was a great balance between it all. I was just so into everything!

I wasn't sure what to expect when I cracked this open but I am thrilled with the fantastic story I was able to lose myself in. If you need some sexy suspense with really hot mob guys thrown in and a tough as nails heroine, definitely give this a shot. I highly recommend it.

The problem for me on this one is a couple things though...1) the downshift from Jace wanting to be this no strings attached, all fun, not commitment player to this totally consumed, totally dedicated boyfriend happened way too fast for me.  That could have been drawn out a bit more to show the transformation that Avery had on him.  Other than that I think that everything else was waaaaaay too drawn out.  This could have been 200 pages shorter and still been really great and gotten the same message across.  I felt like the book could have ended like 2-3 times and then I look down and am only at like 65-70%.  The last 15% of the book was totally not needed and could have all been wrapped up in a short epilogue.  I used to be a HUGE Toni Aleo fan and Taking Shots is still one of my all time favorite books.  The thing that has steered me away from her over the years are these almost 600 page books that just go on and on with no real need.  Last, **TINY SPOILER ALERT**, I actually felt like this book was too similar to her previous book Taking Shots.  In fact the scene where we find out who her dad is could have been practically plucked right out of Taking Shots.  The insecure heroine, the heroine having the horrible verbally abusive family, her hiding secrets about her past from the hero, and I could go on and on are all way too similar.  I feel like Toni's books try to drag in too much plot line instead of digging into the main storyline.  Overall, not a fan.  There were some good moments in there but sadly they were overshadowed way too quickly with too much filler and not enough focus on the real issues.

He was a central figure afterall.  I didn't read the book, and maybe this has been addressed by someone in the other review postings, but I find it odd that the real son was left out of the ending.  This movie would not have been made if it did not have the son figure.  Did he not want to participate and why?  I fear that maybe he and his dad had a falling out.  That would be incredibly tragic and put a damper on the story.

As for the movie, my lower than average rating is because I found the movie to be sooo depressing.  A good drama builds to a climax where the action requires a ""drop-dead"" event, decision or encounter, then a resolution.  Here, 90 percent of the movie was at a climax stage.  It was one horror after another.  Okay, maybe that was the real life, but I needed a break-a few actually.

8698,"This was a typical (new style) regency romance with sex and terminology that might not have existed in that era and the old terminology, arse was combined with newer terminology, cock. The non-virtuous heroine was lucky not to be pregnant from any of her (two?) encounters. While the claim was that there was only one in the past, the language and the descriptions strongly suggested that there were more....The grammatical and spelling errors were relatively few but quite notable, as neckless instead of necklace. It was not made clear how the poor heroine got money, except vaguely from her uncle--it would have taken only a few words to clarify it. It was very predictable. I knew what was going to happen.

The book is really well written, and the author has an amazing imagination, but this is a tough book to get through. Not only do you have to pay super close attention to all the minute details, but her vocabulary is way beyond that of the recommended age group (ages 10-14). I can't remember the last time I used the dictionary feature on my Kindle so much. While a hearty vocabulary is always good, it just seemed unnecessary and a bit pretentious here.

More often than not, Dream Theater sounds like they simply borrow bits from all the other prog rock bands out there, and try to mesh into their own style, but it doesn't work at all, at least not on this CD/album.  I recognise the influences here.  When I'm listening to the album, I can hear Metallica, Rush, ELP, Yes, Pink Floyd, and even Ravi Shankar/Indian influences.  But, unfortunately, the influences don't really mess.  They're all over the place without becoming cohesive, and the album doesn't work at all.  The musicianship is generally very good, but it feels cold and mechanical.  The lyrics are tremendously pedestrian and borderline stupid.  The lead vocalist is desperately trying to bring emotion to the awful lyrics, and he ends up making them worse.  There is one tremendous song that I have played over and over again, and that's Beyond this Life.  Even though the lyrics and singing aren't very good, the music on that one track is fantastic.  But the other tracks don't stay with me.

58,"My review is based on my purchase of the CD.  As much as I wanted to give 5 stars for the content and insights, the reader was so subpar that I could not.

Advertisers have known all along that economic decisions are often heavily based on social, cognitive and emotional factors.  We can know too.  Author Dan Ariely gave incredible insights into ways that people commonly make irrational decisions.  Sure they were based on college experiments, but we learn a lot about ourselves from the results and Ariely's interpretations.

From knowledge gained studying irrational decision-making, I wonder to what extent we can rationalize behavior.  It seems the complexity of decision-making might be increasing, and the irrational biases are apparently hardwired.  For example, even though we know based on Ariely's research that we put energy into being penny wise and pound foolish regarding certain purchases, it seems likely that smart people will continue to do so.

The solutions posed in the book are really separate from the value of the knowledge gained.  Obviously, government has a legitimate role in consumer protection.  Consumers, working constantly and with no time to research the fine print of every type of deal, should be protected to some extent.  Even so, there is no way government can protect citizens from every pitfall.  It makes me wonder if a type of training could be devised to help me, and all of us, override most irrational impacts on decision-making.",0,"[1.1400473329732457, -0.1787361603768005, -1.6544307569543237, -1.0157203859116357, -1.2359981236324118]",1.1400473329732457

Its taking moron to extreme and she legit has a learning disability.. Shes just plain ignorant and I can not stand her. Ok, moving on from that idiot
Clairs mom is also an idiotShe should never have had kids and it really shows why Claire has no idea how to be a parent. If my kid acted a thing like Gavin, hed eat bars of soap everyday and Id be in jail for whoopin his a$$ . The kid has no manners whatsoever, says whatever the heck he wants with no reguard for anything at all its useless parenting and kind of disgusting
I didn't like how irritated and crappy Claire was in the beginning about snoring and cohabitating with Carter and yet when his POV rolls around he talks about how shes the girl of his dreams and hes the luckiest man in the world and blah blah blah. Kinda made me not like her very much for not appreciating how awesome he is

I didn't find any of the characters to be particularly exciting and on a scale of one to ten as far as the sizzle factor between the characters I would give this a one. The setting is pretty cool and kind of quaint and cute, but unfortunately I found the setting more exciting than the characters and the plot. I don't think I will be reading another one of these books any time soon. The worst part of this book for me, was that there was really nothing happening in it that made you want to go on.

Occasionally he writes something good.  This one isn't.  This one involves his rather silly and simpleminded international private detective agency, now in Australia.  Like a mindless soap opera, all the women are either ex-models or could have been.  There are three stories here-a gang related kidnapping, an endangered rock star and a serial killer.

I was hoping this book would delve deeper into the characters but that didn't happen; it didn't even do a little bit of character enrichment for the new ones. There's also the issue of things occurring that we know shouldn't happen. I hate that when writers don't write the scenes the way they naturally would be but force them a certain way because they need it to be that way. This makes me mad. As readers we read these scenes and go, ""really??!! Are you kidding me?!!"" Idk... The story just seemed like it didn't progress very far, it was just kind of flat. Don't get me wrong their are some thrilling battle scenes but ""battle scenes does not a story make"". The last thing is just a thought but I don't get the title at all. I think it's referencing the prince but I'm not sure. I'm moving on to book 3 but only because it's on kindle unlimited; I don't think I would otherwise.

It is so refreshing among the suspense and turmoil of hidden secrets and feelings from other characters!  With the characters coming together in REALLY GREAT scenes and their pasts colliding with their present, this is a highly entertaining read and became one of my favorites of the series!

Songs: ""You Carry Me"" by Moriah Peters, ""If We're Honest"" by Francesca Battistelli, and ""

Kathy Coopmans, you friggin' rock girl!  I loved Shelby and Antonio's story. They had me laughing, crying, and fanning myself during those steamy-as-hell scenes. The banter between them was so hilarious.  ""Love-f@&k"" was my absolute favorite line.  The eye-f@&king"" scene was my favorite part. I busted a gut and had people on the beach looking my way.  It was great catching up with Luke and Shayne and Erin and Adam.

1167,"I was really excited for a new David Levithan book. I've read several of his previous novels and have always enjoyed them immensely. I was intrigued by the writing style, very personal with lines crossed out and rewritten all over the pages. The photos interested me, as well. They seemed peppered throughout the novel, obviously heavily tying into the story.

I was, ultimately, extremely disappointed. To be honest, I couldn't even make myself finish the book. The writing was disjointed and strange (but not in a pleasant manner). It was actually frustrating to read through the crossed out portions, then read the ""correct"" portions. It threw you out of the story instead of sucking you in. The pictures didn't really help along the story, but seemed to just confuse the plot and muddle the story. The characters were boring. The main character wasn't anyone I could enjoy reading about. There was a ton of needless angst that wasn't at all fun to read about. Some authors can pull off angst without making it a chore to read. This book is not of those.

I will read David Levithan books in the future, but I'll definitely be more cautious about trying ""new concept"" books. The premise is still interesting, as well as the overall concept behind the book, but it was poorly executed and ultimately unenjoyable.",1,"[-1.458406791424427, 1.0385467945968299, -1.081886397330078, -1.023546678609549, -1.6753421501747796]",1.0385467945968299

8201,"Took awhile to get to this book because a few books back I felt the writing style changed or something. I wasn't as ""satisfied"" at the end of the author's books as I had been before she got a publisher. Because of that I quit reading the books the minute they came out. After the Luke and Ava disappointment (to me she lied too freaking much and he was so awesome he deserved better) I bought the author's books but put them on hold out of fear I wouldn't like them either.

I liked Ren and Ally and their story but there was so much sex in this book it was as if the sex took place as filler because the plot was short or not long enough. I don't know. it just seemed like they were going at it all the time.  I like the way the author writes sexual encounters but there were just too many in this book (to me).  I also would have liked a little bit of filler on the two most important people in her life (Faye and Benji) because they were so important in Breathe.

That said, I did like this book, very much.  I like how long it was (yay) and how chock full of all the Rock Chicks. People were mentioned that I'd forgotten about but easily remembered with the little prompts. I really like how Ally and Ren worked together and I like their entire relationship.  Ally evolved perfectly into her dream career and Ren. Well Ren. Just so hawt Ren reacted so normally - freaked until he had time to deal.

8390,"I'm truly sad that I didn't enjoy this book as much as everyone else. It was just an OK read for me. Mostly it was the first half -- I had a hell of a time getting into the story, and almost put it away. I felt like the writing didn't flow as smoothly or something...either that or I was just in a mood.

I'm also big on characters, and I was only so-so on Courtney and Clay. Not sure if I just didn't get a good read on them, but it took me a bit to warm up to them. They had their funny moments, but I guess I was just missing some depth....which is funny, b/c I think I'm in the minority for this opinion.

I also had a hard time wrapping my head around the speed with which their relationship moved... I mean, they talked about it themselves and how sometimes you just 'know', but I guess I just had a hard time suspending my disbelief that you could move on after less than a week. But that could be just a personal thing....

Lastly (on the con side -- which this review is feeling super negative and I really hate that), I was missing some sort of conflict...or climax...or something. It just felt very sweet and everyday. Which is not a bad thing, but I guess it's not what I was looking for, you know? Maybe I just wanted more from the conflicts we were presented with (Mike, Nicole, Grant, Maggie).

On the plus side, the sexual chemistry between Clay and Courtney was off the charts. And I really enjoyed the secondary characters (from Clay's parents to Courtney's Mom, to Maggie, Luke, Jenna and Brad).

7499,"After looking at the selection of RFID wallets, I decided on this make and model. I have been unable to find anything wrong with this wallet as outlined in some of the negative reviews. I chose the brown color. The wallet is  made from very thin material and , yes, there is a crinkling sound when the wallet is opened and closed or the bill separator flap is moved. I don't see this to be an issue and just people nit-picking. I've only had the wallet a day or so and it is holding my stuff firmly in place and I don't see anything that would indicate the wallet is fraying or coming apart..., yet.
Now, this wallet is definitely overpriced by about $10-$12 dollars in my estimation. It does feel cheap and I guess the RFID blocking works. I have no easy way to check. I did receive an email asking me to give the wallet a 5 star review for reasons I find unworthy and objectionable.
This is not a 5 star wallet if all factors are considered. I 've had expensive wallets from Italy and this is not in the same class. My review is taking into consideration the price, workmanship and what it is supposed to accomplish with RFID blocking.
In conclusion, the material is thin and the wallet feels cheap and the price is high. On the other hand, I think t was the best pick from the Amazon RFID wallets. I don't expect this wallet to last more than one year at the high end.

1609,"I was annoyed and frustrated through 80% of this book. The reason is, that by my standards, the author does not play fair with the reader. Here are two examples. The book opens with the protagonist having a breakup fight with his girlfriend. Some of the characters in the book know the reason for this fight and how it relates to another incident, known by almost all, they discuss but which is held from the reader. Instead, they make oblque references to both.

This leaves the reader ignorant but the books players informed unlike, say, an Agatha Christie novel where the reader is invited along to solve the mystery with the protagonist and both parties having equal information.

Then again, this withholding of information results in a final 20% that has an enormous impact on the reader. Ive rarely read a book that has this much power, excitement and satisfaction in the wrap up. Its plainly masterful. All the loose ends get tied, plot get mysteries solved and were finally clear or at least less muddled if were reading a thriller, a mystery, a horror novel or a supernatural tale. I wasn't sure until the end and, in a way, still am not.

Another issue is that the protagonist isn't likable  even in the least. By the end, many will have sympathy for him while others will detest him. Im in the latter camp, but I do understand the fellow maybe more than I wish to.

I can recommend this book without reservation, but wish the author would have somehow avoided creating that sense of annoyed frustration I had through a good deal of the books length. Ill leave this off now to comment that in the evening and days after finishing this book, I was enormously gratified that Im married to my fantasy babe.

My husband will tell you that I cry easily:  if Im happy, I cry.  If Im sad, I cry.  If Im feeling patriotic, I cry.  If something is adorable, I cry.  This book had a bit of each of these.  I cried, and cried, and cried.  The lose your mascara, red nose, and red eyes kind of crying.  I only wish I could unread this story so that I could read it for the first time again.  This is one of those few that I will put on my shelf of books that I will re-read again and again.

As I was nearing the end of this book, the phone rang.  My customer asked me if I was sick.  I told her, no, I was crying.  As it turns out, she belongs to a book club.  I gave her the information for this book and she is going to suggest it for her group.  I was very happy to recommend it for them.

2972,"Three novellas by Kelly Long from separate collections (An Amish Wedding, An Amish Christmas, and An Amish Love) are brought together in one book - with an absolutely lovely cover, perfect for the upcoming winter season, might I add! For those who love Amish stories with an extra dose of romance, Long is the author to know.

""A Perfect Secret,"" while certainly an intriguing story to begin with, is probably my least favorite of the three. It comes across as rather far-fetched with a strange premise. Luke's character is mysterious and charming, in a way, but I think if I were in Rose's position I'd be a bit put-off that my best friend and fiance wasn't who I thought he was - and, in fact, had a very different personality that he was only now displaying. But the subtle suspense and the ultimate emphasis on openness and trust in community serve as redeeming qualities.

""Christmas Cradles"" is the shortest of the three stories, and it's the ""quickness"" factor that made me a bit skeptical (the whole ""falling in love in one day"" sort of thing). Otherwise, this is just plain cute! The romance is sweet, the characters are endearing, and the whole story comes together in a symbolic, satisfying way. Very heart-warming!

""A Marriage of the Heart"" is probably my favorite of the three, romantically speaking. Abigail starts out as one of those characters that easily frustrates and annoys, but I loved reading about her growth in love for her new husband, as well as her father. This is a type of ""marriage of convenience"" story - although how it's seen as ""convenient"" for the different characters is certainly different! Joseph is a great hero, and this is a great, short love story! (Add some glasses to the man on the cover, and I personally pictured him and the woman next to him as Joseph and Abigail - although the setting on the cover is more reminiscent of ""Christmas Cradles."")

All in all, this collection is sweet, and these three stories added to my regard for Long's engaging writing style. If you're looking for some romantic, winter-afternoon reads, A Marriage of the Heart delivers.

2627,"Jack dreaded each day of school knowing he would receive endless taunts from the ""macho"" bullies as he had since early grade school after his Dad had simply left. His mother did the best she could working long hours as w waitress in their small town's diner. She just was never there to see that Jack got off in time to catch the bus and to do any chores or laundry. The one good reason to attend class was the new girl in school...beautiful, shy, quiet and unresponsive to friendly gestures by the other students. Jack did have a few other friends but his main objective was to get the new girl, Anna's, attention. Little did he know what events would evolve from there! His reality was about to completely change! Remarkably, his video skills were going to be put to the test!

This was a very fast paced story with a solid build up, great, creative character development, action, adventure and extreme reality! The scenes were portrayed well and more than adequately visualized. The Literary skills ad imagination was superb! However, I feel it was too graphically violent for most of the younger audience it was written for.

Along with the violent action & Zombies, there was a little romance, intrigue and a lot of humor. Additionally, a few positive messages were given to inspire youth.

The Book Title was perfect. Although very eye-catching to the ""browser"" I felt the boy on the cover was too comically portrayed associated with the hero in the story. Jack was a developing teenager and somewhat ""geeky"" but hopefully not that awkwardly unappealing. (Personally, I found him very endearing and pictured as somewhat attractive)

Recommended for youth ages 13 +.

For Anya Von Bremzen food is more about the life of a country as well as the life of a family.  The book looks at life in the Soviet Union from the last days of the Czars until the present through the food her grandparents, parents and her family ate as well as the food the people ate.

Despite limits on what was available the author talks about the creativity her mother used as a young girl to make good tasting meals. She also talks about her interest in cooking and how she learned to get creative with little. In many ways the history of the Soviet Union and any country can be told by the food available.

This is more than a tale about food. It is about her mother's life during  World War II. It talks about and waiting on line for food and crowded living conditions. It talks about hope despite harsh living conditions and  the love of a family despite those living conditions.

The book also includes one recipe for each decade starting in 1910 and ending in the twenty first century. Each recipe symbolizes what was happening in the Soviet Union at the time.

This is a heartwarming  book to read despite the breath of history examined and the often difficult circumstances faced by the  people of the Soviet Union.

ARMAGEDDON is a meteorite disaster flick from a guy's point of view.  The underdog rascals are sent into space to destroy the meteorite after much testosterone antics and posturing.  The chick (Liv Tyler) is hot.  It's a cowboy enterprise.

DEEP IMPACT is the same movie but from a woman's point of view.  The world is about ready to end, but Tea Leoni tries to come to grips with her troubled relationship with her dad.  People hug, make sacrifices, deal with emotions.

Having not read the novels that are the previous installments in the Lucy Kincaid series, I was definitely felt like something was missing.  The rich background of the established characters, that which the whole series is based, is not really explained during No Good Deed.  That being said, this book is well paced and thrilling from beginning to end.  Author Allison Brennan has created a complete world with a very realistic view of the criminal element in society.  FBI Agent Lucy Kincaid is intelligent and strong, both mentally and physically, with a good head on her shoulders.  She takes her responsibilities seriously, but also finds the time to have a life outside work.  She is the kind of character that just leaps off of the pages of the book, which helps the reader to forge a connection with her and the book in general.

1543,"I absolutely loved the plot and storyline of ARCHANGEL'S VIPER. I really enjoyed seeing how the Uram issue played out as we've had those threads dangling for many books now. I have to admit the outcome was a bit of a surprise, not a bad one, but interesting all the same. And Holly? I really love her character, mini claws, vulnerability, and sheer will of determination combined. Uram sure did a number on her and as you can guess the outcome with him fully involved Holly, and I really enjoyed this progression. So plot-wise, this one was stellar.

Now onto the romance. Unfortunately this area was not one of the book's strong suits due to an undeveloped feel in the romance aspects. There's plenty of wit, banter, and overall antagonism between the two that left me laughing more often than not at their antics. And yet, they never really had a sexual tension feel. Venom and Holly could have just as easily been best friends rather than lovers by the end. I just feel like things were written tamer taking Holly's past into consideration, but it just went too tame in my opinion. I just needed something more of a build up to be invested in their romance at the end and unfortunately I just didn't get it.

Romance aside and getting back to the characters, as I said I loved seeing Holly's progression in this book. But the show stealer was Venom, much to my surprise. I have to admit he's never been my favorite of the seven, more of an antagonist to Elena. But we get to see a whole new side of him in this book, and I really loved the added depth to his character. There are reasons he is the way that he is, and it was enjoyable to see his layers get peeled back.

Ben and Renee--they were perfect for each other. Renee is funny and has the ability to laugh at herself when things get crazy. She has an interesting job that sounds fun. Ben has a great sense of humor, and I love a hero with a sense of humor.
Secondary characters Chuck, Janice and Eve--they are all nice and sincerely cared about Renee.

What I didn't like:
Ben was awfully quick to believe what Tracy said about Renee, so his hero crown got a little tarnished for me.
Janice is a great friend to Renee, but when Renee was wallowing after the outcome of the show (we all need to wallow after a big setback, especially in the romance department, Janice tells her she needs to take a shower. If one of my friends ever said that to me when I was down, I'd be really mad.

2857,"If you enjoy books with unreliable narrators who keep you guessing as to the veracity of their words then you should certainly appreciate THE GOOD HOUSE by Anne Leary.  Hildy Good, the book's narrator, is a woman of ""a certain age"" who successfully sells real estate, maintains a good relationship with her homosexual ex-husband, has two grown daughters and a grandson, and has (after an intervention) gotten her excessive drinking under control and her life back on track.....at least that's what she would have her daughters and several residents of her Massachusetts home town believe.  We all know, however, that devil's in the details and in case of Hildy's addiction it's the denial found within the details that allows the devil to do its work.

Hildy considers herself a MENTALIST of sorts when she says, ""I can walk through a house once and know more about its occupants than a psychiatrist could after a year of sessions"". ""Alcoholics, hoarders, binge eaters, addicts, sexual deviants, philanderers, depressives -- you name it, I can see it all in the worn edges of their nests.""  Hildy doesn't seem to realize that she is viewing the town and its inhabitants through an alcohol soaked perspective, so the accuracy of her observations regarding her friends and neighbors is questionable. Couple that with the frequent blackouts and memory lapses she suffers after belting down a few (bottles that is) and is it any wonder the reader would question Hildy's insights.

While alcoholism is the firm anchor that grounds the book, it is Hildy's relationship and interaction with the supporting cast that really imbues the story with an underlying uncertainty that drives the plot.  Her friendship with the obsessive Rebecca, her inter-action with the parents of a special needs child and her on-going (since high school) romantic trysts with town handyman/garbageman Frank Getchell as well as the consequences that result from her uncontrollable drinking are just a few of the factors that will draw you in and keep you reading into the wee small hours.

The positive part of me hoped that it would be a cute homage to the originals, not as good, but enjoyable on its own, similar to the Little Rascals movie. The negative part expected it to be an insult to the stooges' memory.

What I got was actually a little of both. While the impressions of the Stooges were surprisingly good, especially Will Sasso's Curly, the general concept was not faithful to the originals. The stooges are supposed to be chaos in an otherwise normal world. Their relationships with others hinge on the fact that the other people assume they are normal at the start, but learn over time that they are stooges and are upset by their antics. In other words, the world is the straight-man to the comedy of the stooges. This movie goes completely against that premise. From the very beginning we are made to believe that there is something wrong with these boys, but that there is also something strange and/or funny about everyone else in the world. From the singing nun (Jennifer Hudson) to the overtly perfect and cute little boy to the evil and conniving wife (Sofia Vergara), these people are far from normal. I mean, how could the cast of Jersey Shore ever be the normal to the stooges' odd?

Another thing that irked me about this movie was that it was pushed as a family film with family values and wholesome jokes. There is even a disclaimer at the end urging kids not to try to smack each other like the stooges do. The original films were fun for young and old alike not because Columbia pandered to children but because the comedy was universal and ageless. These film makers should not have tried so hard to aim at a niche.

Grammar/editing:  A  near perfect

Katie Logan works for Child Protective Services and is engaged to her supervisor, Grant.  Katie labels it an inevitable engagement after three years of dating.  She knows that the reason she is thirty-four and never been engaged before is because she has always compared every man to her best friend from childhood, Johnny Church.  Johnny is now a rock star.  One night, when Grant is out of town, Johnny shows up and sparks fly.  Neither realizes that the other has fantasized about them ever since high school. Now, what about Grant?

I read this book two months ago, and for some reason never got the review written up.  Today, I was spending time cleaning up files on my computer and the half-file was a reminder.  I realized, I didn't even need to pick up the book, I remember everything about this story.  I think that says a lot about it.  I loved Johnny and identify well with goody two shoes Katie who has dropped herself into an emotional cauldron.  The book is extremely well-written with a comfortable, believable pace of story.

This is a stand-alone book from one of my favorite authors, Jade C. Jamison.  Well, it was supposed to be, but sometimes the fans demand, and, even better, the author capitulates.  So this is now the first in a series.  The next book is a follow-up called EVERYTHING BUT.  I will be reading and reviewing the follow-up sometime in February.

This focuses on Aidan Sullivan. He was alone when the initial outbreak took place so didn't know about it. Now what bothered me about this bit was Aidan somehow got pneumonia and that's the explanation on why he was out of it for 2 weeks. It's easy happen of course, but felt a little too convenient.

Plus the whole way through, he said he was called Sully, then at the very end he said he was called Scratch. I know he evolved as a character, but at no other time did he mention Scratch!! I'm still scratching my head too on where the Aliens came from?? One second he is killing Zombies but then this thing comes and he is battling Aliens!!

In all, I just felt like I missed a lot of the plot and I didn't really connect to any of the characters. I might continue on with the series but I'm not sure yet. It just didn't grab me.

S.W. Salzman was really good, though I did feel that some of the sound effects were unnecessary. If you are doing sound effects, you either do it throughout or not at all, not throw them in every so often!! Other than that.

The circular kibbles are small and of a nice size for my small dog to eat. The first two listed ingredients are lamb and chicken meal, followed by chickpeas and split peas, which appear to be the good source of the 32% high protein content. Furthermore, I like that it has no grain, corn or wheat fillers, which don't fill her up are just gonna make her poop more.

I transitioned her into her new food over a couple of days by slowly and increasingly replacing her old kibbles with the new ones. She doesn't seem to have a digestive problem with the new food. So far so good. This food claims to have a lower glycemic content but I haven't noticed anything different in my dog. So I'm not sure how it works out benefit wise.

All in all, this dog food seems like a quality product. I like that it's grain free, wheat free and corn free, and contains a high protein content from meat and peas.

When George is found dead in his own compost heap in a particular vicious murder involving snakes, Agatha is determined to find out who did it.

Her colleagues, Toni, Simon, Phil and Patrick are all keen to help her as they don't like to see Agatha upset.

Agatha herself is frightened and her private life seems to be falling apart when long time friend and occasional lover Sir Charles Fraith announces his engagement.

I really enjoyed this entertaining mystery and read it in less than twenty four hours. The plot is quite complex and I liked seeing more of Agatha's employees. I like the way the series characters are developing with everyone rallying round Agatha even while they accept she can be intensely annoying at times.

There are many amusing incidents in the story and there are also many where Agatha appears at her best such as in her dealing with the rival detective agency. She jumps to conclusions and puts herself in danger but her hunches are usually good and even the police are starting to pay more attention to what she says - while at the same time treating her as a loose cannon.

There were a few darker strands in this novel with the way the villagers are turned against Agatha by a few comments made by a few people. Some of the suspects are very dubious as well yet standing above it all is Mrs Bloxby, the vicar's wife, with her aura of calm.

Not only does Josie have to take care of her uncle, but she needs to settle his wifes business affairs which include a knitting shop.  She has her work cut out for her.

As soon as she arrives, she is made to feel like an outsider starting with her ornery great uncle. Everyone in town makes sure she realizes shes not welcome. They want her sell the knitting shop and go back home to New York City. Josie does manage to find a couple of friends along the way.

However, things take a nasty turn when a dead body is found in the knitting shop and members of the town council make it clear they want Josie to sell the shop immediately. It's obvious to Josie that someone is hiding something and she intends to find out what that something is.

Josie Blair is the newest amateur sleuth to hit the cozy mystery genre and she makes a great first impression. I loved how she stood up to her great uncle and never backed down even when he clearly didn't want her help. In fact, she didn't back down from anyone, not even those who wanted her to leave Dorset Falls immediately.

The pages flew bywell, I read this on my Kindle so the pages were swiped by. LOL I couldn't put this down until I found out whodunit. It wasn't a total shock, but it was interesting to see how the story unfolded.

The author has given readers an excellent beginning to a great new cozy series. Shes given cozy lovers everything they could want  a strong amateur sleuth, mystery and even a bit of humor woven through the story. Im looking forward to another visit to Dorset Falls.

My only real disappointment was that it seemed to end too abruptly for my taste.

161,"I was at first intimidated by The Rift's size, and the fact that Williams is basically an unknown author. I didn't know if Willimas and the story could hold my intrigue and attention for 900+ pages. The good news is that Walter J. Williams is a really good story teller, and despite what some of the other reveiwers have stated, he does a great job of character development. The science mixed in with the story is well done, and enhances the story quite well. I don't want to spoil any plot points by giving away who survives the terrifying earthquake, or what they encounter afterwared, so I will just state, that if you like disaster stories, you will enjoy The Rift. The series of disasters hitting the Midwest and deep-South is even more terrifying in the fact the Williams' disasters, the quakes, actually occured at the turn of the 19th Century.

The are a couple reasons I only rate the book with 3 stars though. The social commentary, specifically the racial tensions in the novel are pretty heavy-handed and preachy. And the last 3rd of the novel focuses more on the would be race-war, than on the quakes, and other disasters looming on the Mississippi.

Williams also has you invest time in some interesting characters, such as a Park Ranger working the St. Louis Arch, who after following her through some harrowing experiences is forgotten by the author. The same can be said for the many pages devoted to the devious stockbroker, and though we learn of his fate, his whole storyline just sort of peters out without a satisfying conclusion. And the final drawback to the novel is the excerpts and accounts of the 1811 quakes the begin each chapter. After about one third of the novel, these excerpts begin to repeat the same information over and over. After reading half the novel, I just began skipping them. There was really no need to insert so many old accounts of the previous quakes that did not further the current story in the novel.

So overall, there was quite a bit in The Rift that should have been left on the editing room floor.

But saying all of that, I would still recommend you give this entertaining book a shot and I will be sure to read the next book I see by this author.",2,"[-5.598884746033943, -1.6919680552528158, -1.5825431108492694, -0.9919482512843466, -1.0752401025972158]",-0.9919482512843466
1859,"Cisco Suarez wakes up in a dumpster after being killed 10 years ago. He remembers none of the last decade, how he died, or how he got many of the skills and strength he now has. After tracking down a couple of friends, he is able to piece together enough details to follow a trail toward his killers. More questions arise as he finds out someone slaughtered his family and a Hattian voodoo gang wants him dead.

The action continues non-stop throughout the story, voodoo, necromancy, the occult, potions, and more fill the tale with magical violence. The story is written in the first person, so the listener is inside Ciscos head throughout; reliving his fears, insecurities, slowly returning memories and newly discovered abilities. He is a self-taught necromancer and wielder of magic, so most of his skills are sometimes a surprise to him.

As the listener rediscovers Ciscos lost 10 years, we relive his emotions with him, lost friendships, family, and lover. It gets claustrophobic and redundant at times but remains generally entertaining. The plot is less about making sense than following Ciscos stumbling luck as an amateur occult detective.

Neil Hellegers performs the story well, giving it a personality. His voice gets into the listeners head as he becomes Cisco. A solid performance that is pleasant to listen to and gets out of the way when the action gets hot.

Dead Man is a detective story wrapped in the shell of magic and the occult. There are enough dead bodies, zombies, and wizards to fill a small stadium. Strange that the non-magic people don't seem to notice much of it. Never mind, thats not the point. It is Ciscos world and you are invited to share it intimately as you ride on his shoulder. While there is plenty of violence and most of it horrific, it is cartoonish and won't give you nightmares. The story is entertaining enough, fast paced and inventive. Listen to the sample, it will give you enough to decide if the style is your taste.

However, I do have three main criticisms: (#1) I would have liked to see a more thoroughly developed relationship between Naya and Vaugh before they fell in love. (#2) Too many subplots and characters POV switches throughout the book. Made me feel bombarded. (#3) The ending. It ended rather haste.

Over all though, a lovely lovely read! I really LOVED this book and it does have potential. I will definitely be sticking it out for books two and three and the rest of the characters in R.L.

Jack Dalton was trouble, Holliday Hughes knew it the moment she laid eyes on him. He was sinfully sexy, mysterious and charming. The attraction was almost instant, and the chemistry was exploding all over the place. It was supposed to be one night only, and everything would just have to remain in Vegas, but Jack thought otherwise.

Her world turned a sudden 180, which left her off-balance for the onslaught of this man into her life. He was a force to be reckon with  he can be demanding, sweet, charming, vulnerable, and volatile. He kept on surprising me each time I turned the pages. I would hate him, then I would love him again. I would swoon for him, then I would think he didn't deserve any of Hollidays time. But he would make grand gestures that would be so sweet, you cant help but forgive him. Question is, until when?

 This girl is a self-made person. She started from scratch, and her work suddenly became a sensation. She didn't need a man to back her up. She made it on her own, and for that she already had my admiration. But you do not chose who you fall for. Somewhere along the way, she fell, and her life was never the same again. She didn't know it at first. She wasn't prepared for it. She was in love with a rock star.

Their love story is a roller coaster ride you wouldnt want to miss. The ups and downs were pretty much addicting you think you know whats coming, and suddenly something surprises that will leave you off-guard. There was never a boring moment in this book  some pages will infuriate you, some will make you fall in love, others will make you squirm, and each pages will have you hooked youll never want to put this down until you reach the end page.

I have usually only used the large square graters with four sides of different grating sizes. While this only has one grating size (coarse), it is easy to use.

503,"As a follow up to The Great Brain, More Adventures seems somewhat inconsistent.  The first book had more of an adult tone and actually ended without any hint of a sequel.  But Fitzgerald had many more stories to tell, and we get to revisit Adenville again.

This book is, I think, written to be a little more approachable for young (upper elementary/middle school) readers than the previous book.  Even at that, there's a lot in it that appeals to older readers as well.  It's not a complicated read, and adults will finish it in an evening.

As for plot, it does follow closely (but perhaps more outrageously than) Tom's cons as written in the first book.  It is a fine follow up and, in the overall scheme of the series, does a fine job in setting up Tom's ultimate fall a few books later.  I would say seeing Sweyn in a position (as the first Fitzgerald to come home from the Academy) also offers some interesting foreshadowing when Tom returns from the seventh grade a few books down the line.

As a series the entire family would enjoy, I think this is a worthy contender.

Reading A Lady in Defiance was like going back in time to the days when I watched ""Westerns"" on black and white television with my family. Those were good old days! During that era people watched those programs without concern for the outlaws, drunks, gunfights and loose women with low-cut gowns and heavy makeup. They were just good old television shows that we all knew were not indicative of our lives. They were entertainment! We didn't take them seriously. At the same time, reading Heather's book left me with those same feelings of past Westerns.

Varied characters created a depth of humanity and acceptance of the differences in individuals. All types of characters were represented in honest and down-to-earth techniques. This novel is very descriptive and incited many emotions as the story moved along, at a fast pace with no room for boredom.

I enjoyed all aspects of this novel. There is an earthy, authentic, coarseness to the community of Defiance. This is definitely a good versus evil kind of book that kept my attention right through to the end. I highly recommend A Lady in Defiance, and look forward to the sequel!

279,"I love a good family drama, especially with Brits! Add a hefty dash of British humor and I'm all in.  ""The Past"", by Tessa Hadley, is a thoroughly entertaining and addicting story of a family of middle-aged siblings as they reunite for a three-week summer vacation in their grandparent's old and crumbling country manse. We have frivolous Alice and her ex-boyfriend's son, Kasim, orderly oldest daughter Harriet, solid Fran, the youngest and her two delightfully written children Ivy and Arthur. Then there is brother Roland and his new (third) wife Pilar, and his daughter Molly to round out the house party. At first I found Alice to be irritatingly scattered, but by the end I had an entirely different opinion of her. In fact, my feelings for all of the characters changed as the story unfolded.

I'm the oldest of five and so I  can easily identify with (and enjoy!) all the Sturm und Drang of sibling relationships, which just intensified my enjoyment of this novel. In addition, Hadley's prose is gorgeous; her luscious descriptions of the bucolic setting, and shambling old house, brought me right into the setting.

""The Past"" is the kind of novel that illustrates the importance of novels in our lives. There is real value in reading about a character's inner monologue. Hadley is extremely gifted at writing about what her characters are thinking about. The importance for us is that reading about what others think, and why, helps us to gain insight and understanding of the world and the people in it. In striving to understand our fellow human beings, we gain so much: sympathy, empathy, understanding, even sometimes disdain and revulsion.

Warning: unfortunately this publication does not use quotations marks. However, quotes are indicated with leading dashes...it's still difficult and distracting to read, but it's better than nothing (marginally).

The thing is, the Octopus tells Spirit that they've got more in common than he knows.  Neither of them can die, for instance, but the Spirit doesn't know why.

Now he's got even more trouble.  Old flame Sand Serif (Eva Mendez) is back in town and she's in league with his nemesis to acquire relics from Olympus itself.

""The Spirit"" is shot in the noir style of director Frank Miller's successful ""Sin City.""  The dialogue is pure film noir with a whole lot of camp and cliche thrown in, some from Will Eisner's original comic book series homage from many of the B detective films you've seen through the years.

While the film was not billed as a comedy, it was hard not to laugh at the lines and situations.  Samuel L. Jackson makes a great arch-villain and his  monologueing is just classic.  Male fanboys are going to enjoy the various femme fatales in the film, including Sand Serif, Silken Floss (Scarlett Johansen), and Officer Morganstern (Stana Katic) who gives the best line in the whole film.

Rather than a castle laboratory with a mad professor persona along with a hump-backed assistant, Shelley's original tale is of a college student who dabbles in his dorm room and creates the creature. What follows is the creature's actions that span gentile acquisition of language skills to brutal murders arising from his frustration with humanity fearful of his appearance. He haunts and stalks Victor Frankenstein and murders his close friends and loves in an attempt to force V Frankenstein to make him a female companion.

The story is related a series of stories within stories as much of the tale is told by V Frankenstein to the captain of a ship that picks him up while stuck in ice. Victor as been in pursuit of the monster in an effort to destroy him. Within this story is the monster's tale related to Victor of his doings, including his education, which is fairly advanced as he's struggled and failed to insert himself into society. Much of the narrative is spent with V Frankenstein ruminating on his failure with life in general and his role in causing the deaths of so many people around him.

1894,"I enjoyed this fiction account of King Henry VIII's sixth wife, Catherine Parr, and when I saw the author's name is Elizabeth Fremantle I thought her name is ideal for an author of historical British fiction.
This novel focuses on Catherine Parr, and how she coped with being King Henry VIII's wife, knowing that two of his wives were beheaded and that every queen had dangerous enemies at court. Catherine Parr mothered his three children as much as court etiquette and the king allowed her to.
Fremantle shows the romance and the terror of Henry's court, and the terrifying rise and fall of the nobles in his court. Mixed in is the religious fighting between Catholics and the new Church of England, with people being executed on each side, depending on the king's whims and his love life.
Catherine was widowed twice before hoping to marry her beloved courtier Thomas Seymour, when she caught the attention of King Henry VIII, and what the king wants, he gets.

These first three books in the series were easily read, and though some might complain that they were a bit too short, I found it okay. I liked it a lot, in fact. It's refreshing to read romantic-suspense that can be read in a day. Both the suspense and the romance part were cut straight to the point with no unnecessary dramas or ridiculous plots. That was the main reason I gave this box set a 4 stars-review. The story-line themselves were not very original, they've been used many times. However, they way Katie Reus wrap the story and not repeating the plot in the next books were also a thumb-up. I didn't get bored by her third book because they were varied and very enjoyable.

I can name every movie just off the music Eastwood was in.  When seeing the previews for this movie, I knew I'd have to have this one.  Everyone has told me this movie is no disappointment; the previews were very thrilling.  I did expect more action, however, the friendship that forms between the crotchety Walt and Thao is heartwarming.

Walt is a war veteran, very racist, unhappy, mean, and in need of a friend; someone to care about who cares about him.  When he chases the local gang off his lawn saving Thao's hide, Thao is indebted to him and begins to work for him.  Through this they become friends.  Walt's family is nothing but greedy and distant.  Walt soon saves Thao's sister from punks and instantly makes a friend out of her.

I knew there would be death on both sides, but I just didn't know how that would come about.  I did cry my eyeballs out at the sacrifice and the friendship shown.

444,"The things they carried includes the tangible; photographs, letters, the burdensome implements of war; and the intangible; worry, fear, courage, grief. O' Brien's novel feels genuine, plausible. Classified as fiction, it reads like fact. This is due in part to certain plot choices by the author including: a fictional character who shares his name and occupation (a forty-three-year old writer and father); a chapter entitled Notes about the inspiration behind a certain story (the receipt of a letter from a fellow platoon member); and the account of a return trip to Vietnam with his daughter. Typically included in the short story genre, The Things They Carried is actually a series of vignettes about the man who seems to be but is not the actual author, and the men in his platoon. The stories are arranged chronologically at times, other not, and are reflections of lives of the men before, during and after the war in Vietnam: what they did, how they felt, how they dealt. Although the accounts are alternately inspiring, depressing, and bizarre, they never lose their authentic feel. The Things They Carried provides an excellent, unconventional look at war.",4,"[-3.117265385503272, -1.0529370566282672, -1.6237886008428062, -0.9944148296564583, -1.4719130327862242]",-0.9944148296564583

One of his students, Jacob, has a form of autism but is a brilliant student who her father took under his wing and let him work on their special window project from the church. Also a big part of the shop is Hugh Troyer her father's assistant who Savannah figured she would turn the business over to while two very pushy and arrogant people, one a competitor of Webb's and one a buyer of properties for big building concerns kept pressing her to sell to them! What a mess, where was Hugh, Savannah started teaching Hugh's class when Jacob discovered Hugh, in the special workshop, dead. The police and coroner called it a heat attack, like her father. But now Savannah is suspicious, especially when she finds a cryptic message hidden for her from her father. Was Hugh's death and her father's death really a heart attach or was it murder?

I though Gideon an interesting character and I liked his narrative voice quite a lot.

Emily Coleman wakes up one day an abandons her life for something completely different. Throughout the whole novel, I wondered why she would leave such a seemingly happy life. When we find out what happened at the end of the novel, I definitely understood her a little better! A tragedy has struck and changed her life completely, but thankfully, at the end she turns it all around. There's a happy ending in this story, which is one of my favorite parts of a book (: Tina Seskis has a wonderful writing style; everything is straightforward and easy to understand. She doesn't use extra details to fluff up the story more, something that tends to drive me crazy in some novels.

This is a story of love/lust at first sound, great friends crazy Ex and giving love a chance despite all your fears.
After meeting Jody (which is a girl's name by the way) Lacey has a very overwhelming reaction to him, the chemistry and attraction between the two is powerful to the point where it terrifies them both.

Caveman meets Alpha on speed. possessive much? Jody had a rough childhood, after his father walked out when he was only 10 years old he had to become the man of the house and protect his little sister. So now a 36 year old man he is....a tad POSSESSIVE. Apart from that he is an absolute sweetheart. He is a big bad and mean on the ice but off he is a complete soft marshmallow.
Lacey is a very independent women with  an Audi R8 and serious trust issues with men. Well you really can't blame her,  she is only trying to Protect her heart after she caught her  Ex On what was suppose to be their wedding day screwing on of the bridesmaid.
When she finally threw caution to the wind and give into what she feels for Jody they sizzled and the love between them grow

This man is just the sweetest he treat Lace like a queen. Because she IS the queen of his world.
Nikki tells this story in the third person which allows us a small insight into what all the characters were thinking/feeling. I loved that the book was not only focused on the main characters but all the secondary cast received a voice.

The storyline and flow, I liked. I loved our secondary characters and storylines too. I kinda of wish more was addressed as far as what Pavlov did, but... That's just my need for justice.

 This one caught my eye because of the time period it was written in. I enjoy reading about the Revolutionary and Civil Wars, and Woodhouse did a great job on weaving a fictional tale and fictional characters with historical events and people. I really liked her two main characters, and their dangerous spy mission was as good and suspenseful as a suspense novel. I have read books before where a main character was a spy, but I think this is the first book I have read where both main characters were spies.

  It is interesting to see how different authors portray real historical people, and I enjoyed this author's portrayal of George Washington and Benjamin Franklin.

  I enjoyed the book a lot, and only wished it had been a little longer. It ended way too soon. Even though it was historical fiction, the story helped remind me of the sacrifices that were made to win our freedom and to keep it.

558,"dmittedly, I did not enjoy this third volume in the series as much as the first (and perhaps the second). What started out as a supernatural mystery with interesting angles on 'creatures' of mythology kind of devolved into a statement about interracial marriage and procreating. Yes, themes of the past and the mistakes we make carried over from book two. But on the whole, with a heavily pregnant main character and multiple POVs, the story lost a lot of impetus and mystery.  Ashmole 782 became a mcguffin to the vampire-witch romance.

Story: Diane and Mathew are back in the present. But mistakes from the past are catching up to them and their enemies are closing in.

For such a large book, the synopsis pretty much condenses into two sentences. The honeymoon is definitely over for Diana and Mathew and now it is more about the people in their lives than the original Ashmole 782 mystery. Indeed, though finding Ashmole 782 started the story back in book one, very little of it is really explained or discussed by book three. I wanted to know more - and to get some answers finally to those questions.

But what is explained is the change in the vampires, witches, daemons and their de-evolution. As well, we get to explore Diana's magic more as well as Mathew's family. Yes, I wish the book had stuck with two point of views (namely, Mathew and Diana's).  As well, there is a lot of science babble in this book - even more so in a series that is well known for its ability to describe everything in minutiae.

There were enough doors left open that I would not be surprised to see the series continued beyond a trilogy. Gallowglass especially makes an enticing protagonist. But at the same time, I hope it isn't a sprawling mess.

Let me start with the title - it's not a very accurate one for the story.  The cover/title combo makes me think this should be some superpower laden action romp.  It's more 28 Days Later meets The Walking Dead but way less interesting.  Melanie is a hungry (read zombie) but she's high functioning and more human than most of the hungries which is why she's in a facility with a bunch of other kid hungries.  Things go wonky, Melanie ends up out in the world along with her crush/teacher Miss Justineau, Doctor Caldwell who only wants to dissect her, Sergeant Parks the military muscle, and recruit Private Gallagher.  Their goal - to reach civilization by going through hungry infested lands.

See, it's a road trip!  With zombies!  And generally one dimensional characters.  Melanie could be super interesting but the story skips between characters and their various journeys so often that it's hard to get a solid bead on most of them.  There's also a lot of tell not show going on in the dense writing.  The beginning is very slow to get into.  Events and circumstances pick up but never with more than a marginal interest.  The conclusion was more a relief for the fact of meaning I'd finished the book than actual events.

Elle was so happy that she was going to get to watch the Gillespie House while Mr. and Mrs. Gillespie went out of town for a bit. She wandered through all of the rooms and found some really nice antique furniture in the upstairs rooms that no one ever went into for some reason.

She found an old cemetery that had mostly Gillespie relatives in it. She started doing research on the place and found out about some of the residents that lived there years ago.

She also found out in all of her searching that there were some ghosts still lurking around the house, one good and one bad.

She made it a mission to help out the good spirit and in so doing found out an old mystery that the owners have wanted to know for about four years now. All of this turns out good in the end for everyone involved.

I loved this little ghost story, it has all of the good stuff of a creepy house with ghosts and secrets.

2215,"Bathsheba, the final book in The Wives of King David series written by Jill Eileen Smith, is the ultimate example of God's forgiveness. Most people know the story of David and Goliath, but how many actually delve into his life as King? I can honestly say I didn't think much about David's life after the defining moment in battle against Goliath, although I did hear Bible stories about his adultery and following misdeeds to relieve the guilt he felt about his sins.

Throughout the book, we first come to learn of the relationship between Bathsheba and her husband, Uriah, who was one of the 30 counselors to King David. It seemed like their relationship was ideal, although they had difficulties as does any relationship. Uriah was often gone at battle and he forced strict adherence to the laws. As Uriah was away at battle for a long length of time, King David decided he wanted to have a relationship with Bathsheba. She did not deny him, and she soon learned she was pregnant with his child. Upon hearing the news, David attempted to have Uriah come back home and incorrectly believe he was the father of the child. When Uriah would not return to his home, David instead sent him to the front lines where his death was inevitable. Upon Uriah's funeral, David took Bathsheba as one of his numerous wives.

The remainder of the book focuses on David and Bathsheba attempting to find forgiveness from God, as well as learning to forgive themselves. Many battles ensue, where David's own sons attempt to usurp his throne, but, in the end, God's will is carried out and the heir God deemed to be King is placed upon the throne.

I really enjoyed this book, and it was the first one I have read by Jill Eileen Smith. I cannot wait to read more of her books in the future, especially the first two books in The Wives of King David series which look at his earlier wives, Michal and Abigail. The format of the book was easy to understand; although I often find stories that are based on Biblical occurrences to be confusing, that was not the case with this book. The characters were well-developed, as I felt for Bathsheba even though I did not agree with her actions.

9680,"Even though I already have some insect problems in the vegetable garden, I haven't used this there.
After doing a little research on the active ingredient, I learned that it can be harmful to bees.
Someone in our area must have taken up beekeeping a few years ago and I maintain several bee blocks for solitary bees.
We have quite a few toads in the garden, on the patio and other spots that consume a lot of insects.

We also have backyard chickens for the first time this year and I don't want to risk harming my chickens if I toss them a tomato hornworm or cutworm from the garden.  The squirrels steal all of the fruit from our fruit trees long before they are full size or mature, so I don't bother spraying them since we rarely get anything from them.

So after giving it some thought, I used this to spray around all of our windows and window ledges outside.  I sprayed the cracks in our driveway and on our patio.  I did apply it to our roses and other container plants in the front of the house, but chose not to apply it to anything in the vegetable garden.  When I need to deal with insect problems in the vegetable garden, I prefer to use products like neem oil, sal suds, BT or just a soap spray.  I don't want to cause any harm to the many bees that work so hard to pollinate everything in our yard.

From what I've read about the active ingredient, it doesn't appear to pose any substantial health risk to humans and breaks down fairly fast, but I prefer to use caution rather than chemicals on products we will consume and not risk harming beneficial insects.

We really liked the dispenser and wand that uses standard batteries.  I used most of the gallon as I've mentioned, but will save the container for applying other solutions in the future.",2,"[-1.4876033107765616, -1.5463735657523388, -1.3513609431859936, -0.9955520579492394, -1.4051524989698796]",-0.9955520579492394

431,"For many years I turned away from romance novels. I considered them to be foolish, sentimental and a waste of my time.

Then one day I decided I wanted to read a really good romance so I went online and googled ""Best Romance Novels"" and Voyager (Outlander Series) came up as #1. So, I thought - why not? After reading all the books in this series by Diana Gabaldon (not once but twice) I am now eagerly awaiting what is purported to be the final book, ""Written in My Own Heart's Blood.""

Other reviewers have written about the premise for this book which involves time travel for a young married woman named Clare Beauchamp Randall from the 20th century who accidentally goes back in time to the 18th century. Not knowing if she will ever return to her life in the 20th century and in order to spare her life, she must get married in the 18th century. So she marries a young man named Jamie Fraser.

What can I say that would be enough? In my opinion, Jamie Fraser is close to everything a woman would want in her mate. He is loyal, willing to give his wife freedom to be herself, selflessly sacrifices himself for those he loves, has a heart large enough to take in those who are not his blood and make them family and may God have mercy on you if you try to harm them.

The adventures Jamie and Clare go through together are absolutely amazing. The set of books in this series can be truly identified as historical. You will never again view the Scottish people in quite the same way after you go through the Battle of Culloden with them. From the court of Louis XV where the Bonny Prince Charlie was a guest to the American colonies and the American Revolution, you will be transported through time to see how the Scottish emigrants worked to make a life.

Although Jamie's and Clare's relationship began as a marriage of convenience, theirs became a life-long love affair. My favorite set of books in this genre. Because of this book, I began reading romance novels again but I have never found anything to compare with this series.",4,"[-3.334442988501271, -1.5319154747449297, -1.5869879710946135, -0.9957799777971137, -1.0405786132291017]",-0.9957799777971137

478,"For some, a mystery is satisfying if it has a crime, clues and a solution. That's sufficient if all one wants is a bit of entertainment to pass a few hours.

Most of us who love to read want more than that from a novel. Sure, we like to be entertained. We also like to be challenged, informed and dazzled with insights going beyond the mere puzzle postulated in traditional whodunits.

P. D. James has met that expectation again in this, the latest in her Adam Dalgliesh series. For some there will be reminders of classic Agatha Christie manor house mysteries. But James goes way beyond Christie in her insight into characters and compassion for their foibles.

Rhoda Gradwyn, an investigate journalist, goes to the private clinic of famed plastic surgeon George Chandler-Powell for removal of a scar she's had since childhood. Two days later, she is murdered in her bed. When AD and his team arrive on the scene they find a limited number of suspects, all with prime motives. There are questions about forged wills, old grudges, a previous murder and even why Miss Gradwyn had chosen to have her scar removed after having lived with it for so many years. The plot and tension thicken with a second murder which may or may not connect to the first.

A central theme of the book is changes--those occurring both in the lives of her characters and in society.

As always, the murders are solved. But the resolution does not completely satisfy AD. But isn't that true of life? Nothing is ever fully resolved. We are always left to consider what may have been.

Technically its a stand-alone but youll get a better experience if you read the other books first (especially Until Lily and Until July). This book was funny, sweet, and hot. The characters were engaging and likeable. The story kept me glued to my tablet so I ended up reading the whole book in one sitting.

Jax and Ellie had awesome chemistry. Jax new immediately that Ellie was his Boom but of course Ellie needed some convincing. Jax is seriously hot, protective, and sweet. I know some people don't like the insta-love in stories like Jax experiences but I liked it. Ellie on the other hand, has to be coaxed and pursued by Jax.

When she overhears that an agent's cover may be blown, she contacts his partner, Jimmy Nash, and includes herself in the rescue. She does a good job but even that doesn't win her the promotion--it does win her a one-night-stand with Nash, though, and she's wanted Nash for a long time.
Frustrated at the CIA's unwillingness to let her into the field, Bailey quits and joins Troubleshooters Incorporated, a private company run by ex-Navy Seals who take on the jobs the government won't do. There she finds herself on a team with Nash, his partner, and several other ex-Seals, Marines, and ex-CIA agents--being sent to Kazbekistan--a Moslem failed state whose warlords are reputed to have close ties to Al-Qaeda. An earthquake has created a humanitarian disaster serious enough to force Kazbekistan to open its borders for the first time in years--and killed the local Al-Qaeda leader. The man may be dead, but his laptop computer, equipped with all of Al-Qaeda's plans for terrorist plots, is still at large.
In Kazbekistan, Bailey and Nash confront the attraction that neither wants but neither can deny. Somehow, between dodging aftershocks, heading off a noisy newspaper reporter, setting up illegal broadcast towers, and chasing down every CIA contact left in the country, they make time for passion. But passion comes with its own price--especially as Nash comes to realize that his partner has fallen for Bailey too.
Throw in a beautiful American whose husband was beheaded by the local dictator and a daring rescue in the fortress-like headquarters of the local warlord and you have an exciting romantic adventure.
Author Suzanne Brockmann does an excellent job characterizing the damaged Jimmy Nash and setting him up for redemption at the hands of the first woman who can actually understand and respect him for who he is.

She was kidnapped only for an empathetic piece where the kidnapping of Summer was concerned, and to hear Beth say, again and again, that she was only found because Summer had someone looking for her... oh my gosh, my heart continued to break for her.

When Beth meets Cade, he's one of the firefighters to show up to her house when she has a stove fire. Her fears of going outside, and the flames in front of her, have her stuck in place. Another firefighter wants to get Beth outside, nearly forcing her, but Cade knows better after discussions with his sister -- and from training as a whole.

I enjoyed Cade's character. He was a great brother to Penelope (with the eyes she and Moose make, I sure hope they have a story someday), a great listener for both Pen and Beth, and never once made Beth feel like she was less than. As much as Beth is embarrassed by her needs and her fears, Cade helps her through them like's it no big deal.

Like Quint and Corrie, I loved the understanding of our male lead. I at times felt that the deep feelings were a bit quick, but it was so incredibly easy to overlook. Beth's coping mechanisms aren't the best, we'll learn, but Cade's understanding, his need to help her (and scold her from a protective stance only)... There's a scene where Cade battles his training and what Beth needs, and it's a scene that is very defining for them as individuals. Cade is a stand-up guy, and as scared as Beth could be, she tried to do what was right. The following panic attack was also incredibly well written -- from both Beth and Cade's stand points.

I found myself bored with Darcy's almost-perfect life and how easily everything came to her. I even caught myself skimming the Darcy sections in order to get to the Lizzie tale faster.

270,"As an avid mystery reader, I'm always thrilled to find a new series! I had picked up an earlier volume and didn't get into it but this one was a winner. Although I haven't read any of the previous novels in the series, I was able to follow easily.

The series takes place in period between World Wars, a time of great change for the British Isles and virtually everywhere. Many men went to war and many were traumatized by the experience. It's a more realistic picture than Downtown Abbey, thought the action takes place around the same time frame.

Todd maintains a lively pace with a plot that is plausible, yet takes the reader through many twists and turns. The book held my interest completely - it was hard to put down. The main character, Inspector Rutledge, is likeable and complex. The style reminds me of the Maisie Dobbs series, which also takes place in this era. Maisie operates in a unique role, especially for a woman; Rutledge is a better than average Scotland Yard detective in a traditional role.

It's fun to enjoy the period piece. Some villages were not on the phone at all, and of course cell phones hadn't been invented. With no television, people amused themselves. And with a lower crime rate, you could still roam around after dark ... most of the time.

All in all, a jolly good read and a magnificent escape on a dreary weekend.",4,"[-3.326599860170079, -1.1814342115697931, -1.4434369308196648, -0.9971479428960778, -1.3145999964418449]",-0.9971479428960778

453,"I enjoyed reading ""A Year in Provence"" years ago when it was first published, and since it was on the recommended reading list for our upcoming 3 week tour of France, I decided to re-read it. We will be spending some time in Provence, though not mingling with the locals to the extent that Mayle did when he and his wife moved from England and bought an old farm house to remodel and live year around. Mayle's adventures in hiring contractors and getting any work done on a reliable timetable are told humorously, thought with no disrespect to the French workers. They learn that in France, time is marked by seasons rather than days. They finally devise an ingenious method to get all the contractors to come back and complete the various unfinished projects around the house before Christmas - they send out invitations to a champagne reception to which the spouses are also invited. They know that none of the contractors will want their partners to be embarrassed by incomplete work !

Mayle also writes of their journeys to visit fabulous restaurants and the French love of food and wine. He cultivates vines on his own property, and also learns to appreciate a perfect olive oil.

The tales of the endless string of visitors, some mere casual acquaintances, and some of whom invite themselves to stay, are also told with humour and restraint, though you definitely get the impression that they felt put upon from time to time. I also discovered that it can be brutally hot during the summer months in Provence, so I'm glad we're going in early spring !

""A Year in Provence"" is not at all a travelogue, or even a guide book, but is a terrifically entertaining series of essays about living among the French in every season, being accepted (at least to a certain extent) into their culture, and enjoying all that this beautiful country has to offer.",4,"[-3.5988881568171913, -1.4862672323463382, -1.7436596025423556, -0.9974951712765816, -1.1616576267198315]",-0.9974951712765816

41,"Prominent author Bernard Cornwell, famed for the Richard Sharpe series and the Arthurian Warlord trilogy, begins anew with a series set in a time of immense change.

It is the fourteenth century, the Hundred Years War is about to begin (lasting until 1428); the Black Plague has already begun ravaging Europe and taking life; and then there is still the Great Schism to come (a time where three popes ruled and the entire area of Christian Europe was excommunicated).

Our hero is Thomas of Hookton.  In 1343 his town was sacked and pillaged by the marauding French, and everyone was killed except him.  Now years have passed and he is fighting for the English army against the French; the stage is set for the Hundred Years War, while in the back of his mind lurks a revenge against the people who razed his town and killed his friends and family  They have stolen a relic from his church, the lance that was supposedly used by Saint George to slay the dragon.

The crux and closure of the novel involves the first monumental battle of the Hundred Years War, the Battle of Crcy, the first great win for the English against the French.  It is here that Thomas of Hookton, one of the best archers in all of Europe, will fight for the English, as well as avenge the destruction and death that he has suffered for so long, and in the course of battle, the famous lance of Saint George will shine like a beacon, as Thomas fights to reclaim what was stolen from him.

Once again Bernard Cornwell outdoes himself in this wonderful new series.  While the writing is not a high literary level, the book is nevertheless compelling, and the history extremely well researched.  Cornwell skillfully weaves in the details and facts of the period, serving as a colorful world for the strong characters to interact with.

The reader quickly learns that the reason England is so victorious against the French is because of the infamous longbow (a later coined term).  We even see the first cannons ever used by Edward III, which fail pitifully and are used more in hope than effect.  Cornwell ends the novel with the Battle of Crcy, setting himself up for a complete series of one of the most major wars in the history of civilization.

But Michael Wallace has added good characterization, an intriguing plot and the promise of more to come in a series of books.

Since so many others have commented on the plot, let me say I was most impressed by his aptly named character Jacob Christianson and his sister, Eliza, who rather than act like the puppets many assume they might be, don't hesitate to question the tenets of their faith when it conflicts with reason and their own morality.

Though his focus is on a spinoff polygamous Mormon group, the situation could be applicable to many of the fundamentalist sects spawned by most any of the major modern religions and raises many timely questions.

254,"This novel reminded me of ""Dune"" in a lot of ways. It was a sweeping epic that spanned galaxies, with lots of main characters, but was centered on a small world with a very important commodity that extends life. And both commodities have unusual, biological sources. But, after that these two books diverge greatly.

Tiamet is ruled by the Snow Queen. She has ruled for nearly 150 years and will die when the wormhole to other worlds closes during ""summer."" Tiamet changes from a technological society to a rural one when the other worlders take their advances and go. It is then that the Summer Queen will reign. Only, the Snow Queen doesn't want to give up her throne, or the technology. One technology may hold her answer - cloning.  Like Herbert, Vinge does get a little carried away with her world building.  There are a lot of details that aren't really necessary and bog the book down at times, but overall a reader is completely absorbed.

This book screamed literature. It seemed like the type of book taught in advanced high school English classes. It had a dreamy mist about it that kept me from becoming immersed in the story. I felt a step removed the entire time I was reading it.

The characters were definitely unique. And yet they seemed quintessionally Newfoundlander. Full of love and loyalty for the sea, and their special rock.

The story reminded me of The Old Man and The Sea. I'm not sure how accurate the comparison is since I haven't read it since high school over 10 years ago, but within the first 20 pages, this is what I immediately thought. If anyone has read both stories more recently, perhaps you could tell me if my comparison makes sense.

Overall, this was a very interesting read. It was a vast overview of life starting from the 1800s and progressing through several generations. The characters and families intertwine so complexly, and yet still make sense.

3339,"There are many books written in diary format in zombie-world, and very few of them that I particularly enjoyed. If I had known that Apocalypse Z was written as a diary, I therefore probably would have passed it over, but I'm glad I didn't. I believe that the name of the main character is never revealed, and although there's a chance it's my memory failing me, I'm pretty sure from one of the final scenes of the book that this is on purpose. So for the purposes of my review I shall call him Survivor Man.

Originally written in Spanish, and translated recently into English, Apocalypse Z is the journal of Survivor Man, a widowed lawyer, and his cat, Lucullus, and their experience of the global zombie apocalypse. What I really liked about the journal format in this case was that he does include a lot of information about the fall of the world to the undead, and that his journey always has a purpose - whether searching for other survivors, or escaping a bunch of dodgy sailors and their crazy captain - and he's also dedicated to his cat.

Pets in the apocalypse are rarely touched upon, and although there a few examples of dogs as companions or family members while fighting zombies, this is probably the first one I've come across with a cat - and as a cat person, it was a huge added bonus.

There was a turn in the plot halfway through, when Survivor Man meets a bunch of sailors on their ship, and this is where Apocalypse Z lost me a little, because I didn't really understand the point of it, and it all seemed a little far fetched and unnecessary. It did drive the rest of the plot, but it didn't sit very well with me - it felt like the author had imagined the most unlikely scenario possible just for the sake of having something unique, rather than something that fit.

Overall Apocalypse Z is a good, solid zombie read. It didn't blow me away, but it was enough to keep me satisfied and turning the pages, and I loved that the main character was so dedicated to his cat, and treated it more like a person than 'just an animal'. It does have some unique aspects, but not all of them felt to me like they belonged. However, I'll be interested to see where this series goes next, however currently the next book is not yet translated into English.",2,"[-4.3420322932179305, -1.984963332329304, -1.8051957551018, -0.9987754566453597, -1.0179334329906509]",-0.9987754566453597

548,"This book is a brilliant step-back overview of the state of our fisheries.  Although I felt like I was pretty knowledgeable on the subject, my eyes have been opened up to deeper level of complexity than I had ever considered. Especially on the economic and market driven side of the issue.

Perhaps, the best thing about this book is that it is not a pulpit the author uses to preach what you should or should not eat.  Nor does it ask that the reader guiltily end all fish eating.  What it is, is a contextual history of our relationship with seafood from the earliest day to the present where we find ourselves facing a lot of decisions regarding fishing and fish farming.

The narrative is centered on four fish that do a good job of capturing the story of fish and man.

  Salmon- probably our first food fish, and our first foray into global, industrial fish farming.

  European Sea Bass - our first complete victory in closing the circle on a marine fishes life cycle in captivity.  As the author says, a Rosetta Stone to unlocking the propogation for nearly all species

  Cod and Tuna - two examples that show that we are not doing the best to manage our fisheries, and how we may be misguided in our attempts to farm fish in general.

These four fish do a great job of illustrating how aquaculture has been driven by forces of economy, market, and tradition  more than logic, reason, or science.  These species has been chosen for domestication more for their pound for pound economic value rather than its compatibility to being farmed.

Using these four main characters, and a supporting cast of other species, the author demonstrates the failures, successes, and potential of human management of wild and domesticated stocks of fish.  That is another joy of this book, it is not a doom and gloom look at our future, it is a reasoned and hopeful view of what we can do.  And while it does not exactly spell out a plan, it does put forth a strong framework of how we can manage this resource and stop spending our principal, but live off the interest the ocean can return and the profits of intelligent aquaculture.

I'll never look at a fish on a plate the same again.",4,"[-3.160194171373214, -2.2103884527299993, -1.6316492254353845, -0.9990299424034675, -1.1070305939863956]",-0.9990299424034675

-Occupancy/Vacancy, Off/On, Delay
-Automatically on when you enter, off after delay when you leave.
-Manually on when you enter, off after delay when you leave.
-Can be used for a bath fan up to 3 amps.

I am using it for my bath ventilation fan.  It is not on during most times I am in the bathroom.  However, when I manually turn it on for a shower, it will turn off after 30 minutes of sensing no motion.  I have a separate wall switch w/dimmer to control the light in my fan.

Features:
-The delay off has a setting of: 1, 5, 15 and 30 minutes.
-There is also a feature sensing the ambient light in the room and not turning the lights on, if you want that feature.  I didn't use or need that feature for my bath fan installation.
-This switch has a feature of going back on if the timer expires, and you re-enter the room in less than 20 seconds.  This is important to know during you initial tests, that yes, it is working properly.  An example of where this could work well is a conference room with very little motion.  If the lights turn off because of no motion, you could wave your arms and the lights would turn back on.
-This unit has 2 settings for motion sensitivity, so you hopefully won't even have this ""conference room"" situation arise.

General Points:
-The install is quick and straightforward.
-The instructions are detailed and well written.  They will help most homeowners handle this basic task, even if you do not routinely do electric projects in your house.
- Minor point: The small white-headed cover-plate screws thread into the plastic and the plastic is not pre-threaded.

3163,"I have pretty mixed feelings here. There were some parts of this book I really liked, for example the fact that Lee let her main characters be bad. So often PNR heroines miraculously resist all evil temptation. I really appreciated that Alexa gave in to hers and admitted that she enjoyed watching Arys too. It added an element of edgy realism that I enjoyed. I also loved both Arys and Shaz. Unfortunately I hated the situation they found themselves in. It wasn't fair to either of them. Of course, it wasn't meant to be, but I found it painfully uncomfortable. I really wanted her to choose one or for the three of them to become a happy Mnage  trois.

I generally enjoyed the story, but I have two main complaints. One, it felt like there were four main story lines that ran parallel but never really intersected. There was Alexa and Arys' situation. There was her and Shaz's budding romance. There was her night job with Veryl and there was the whole mystery with Raoul. Any one of them probably could have been a book on its own. Well, maybe the love triangle would need to be combined, but you know what I'm getting at. The Raoul situation seemed to be the main storyline, so any time Alexa ran off to fight a random demon or psychotic ex-lover I found it distracting. It essentially felt like it had nothing to do with the rest of the plot. Plus the events required the introduction of random characters who then simply disappeared, Lilith for example.

Two, there was a lot of presumed knowledge. Alexas is described as a werewolf with extra, vampireish abilities. But these are never really described. I have no idea which of her powers were the unusual ones or why she had them. Similarly, I never really understood her and Arys' metaphysical draw. I certainly understood the effect, but not the why, how, or even what of it. I would have really liked a more in-depth description.

Washington is seen as a solid general who knows when to fight and when to retreat. The British, for numerous reasons, never took the fight to the Americans when they had the opportunity to do so.

The main female character Jean is such a goody two shoes. She is introduced to the reader by hunting for ghosts.  It is not scary, it's kind of silly.  The main male character Lord Morgan is for the most part an innocent as well.  While there are aspects of this that are endearing & not typical in most romance novels, it gets old fast.  Mostly it was to cutesy for me.  Jean's deep dark secret that she feels she must hide from Morgan at all costs is so insignificant when one considers all the horrors one could have conjured up & want to hide.  Jean is innocent in every way except for the fact that she hides her past from Morgan.  Hardly a crime.

The least cutesy character & the one I found the most believable is Jeans sister.  She is nothing but trouble.  If it wasn't for her constant scheming the book would be rather dull & have no substance as most of Jeans actions are the direct result of her sister.

The love scenes are few & far in-between.  The loves scenes that do occur are very PG.  I am not into lurid obscene sex scenes but some healthy steamy romance is nice every once in a while in a Romance novel.  This felt like it was written for virginal eyes.

As with most of these books, your political viewpoint will undoubtedly affect your enjoyment of the book.  The left won't want to hear any of the valid criticisms, a fact that's already been proven by all the one-star reviews on here by people who probably haven't even read the dust jacket, much less the book itself.  If you lean towards the right, or if you're just a Hilary-hater in general, you'll likely enjoy reading about her supposed evil, scheming ways.

Klein's writing is good, even if some of what he writes seems unbelievable.  He tends to reach at times, but without that reaching this book wouldn't have generated such controversry.

Mild spoiler alert:  I liked the largely Norwegian cast.  I liked the alien special effects.  I liked the spaceship scenes.

I missed Russell and Brimley (they definitely ""made"" the earlier version for me). I think that it was a very smart idea in this movie to have a female protagonist - one that wouldn't ""compete"" with Russell.

I've read scores of these types of books, and ""The Purpose Driven Life"" is different in several ways. First, it offers you a step-by-step plan for creating a sense of meaning in your life. Second, it's based in scripture. Third, it advocates making the church the center of your life.

These differences can also be the book's drawbacks. I always sensed that the author had a bit of an agenda -- being a pastor of a huge church, of course he believes in the importance and sanctity of organized religion. But what if you aren't a member of a church? What if your church is dysfunctional? What if you feel called to do things outside your church?

I for one believe that God has given us different talents and different strengths and different passions. SOME of us are called to serve in the church. And some of us are called elsewhere. Warren seems to ignore those of us who are pulled to serve others and use our talents outside of our church. After reading this book twice (once on my own and once through a small-group study through my church), I was still left with many, many questions -- and a deep-seated feeling that there was more to life than what Warren had presented.",2,"[-1.9112810557311994, -1.462276737147172, -1.3938077122806594, -1.0010866998969061, -1.2440133616709717]",-1.0010866998969061

I remember being blown away by several of his stories, and over the years I eagerly devoured both of his novels, You Remind Me of Me and Await Your Reply, which was one of my favorite books I read in 2009. Stay Awake is Chaon's return to short stories, and while I didn't feel that any of the stories in this collection packed the power of some of his older stories, they are still tremendously well-written and immensely readable.

All of the characters in these stories are dealing with some sort of trauma, be it physical, psychological, even paranormal. Some of my favorite stories included ""To Psychic Underworld:,"" in which a young widower starts finding cryptic notes on dollar bills, restaurant napkins, tacked to trees, etc.; ""Thinking of You in Your Time of Sorrow,"" which follows a high school couple whose lives are thrown into turmoil when their baby dies; ""Long Delayed, Always Expected,"" in which a woman has an interesting way of dealing with empty nest syndrome; and ""I Wake Up,"" which follows a young man who receives an out-of-the-blue phone call from his oldest sister, years after their family has been split into separate foster homes following their mother's horrible crime. Some of the stories work better than others; I tended to enjoy those that dealt with more regular situations than those which focused on the odd or paranormal.

Dan Chaon is a terrific writer, and his storytelling ability definitely shines in many of the stories in this collection.

The List is cut from the same cloth as the recent trend of teen-oriented post-apocalyptic and dystopia fiction.  While this whole genre of YA novels would point to classics like Fahrenheit 451 and The Giver as sources of inspiration, none of them measure up, including The List.

Letta, Forde's young, female heroine (most of these have young, female heroines, of course) is the assistant to the Wordsmith of Ark.  Ark was founded by an environmentalist named Noa (haha) who became frustrated when no one heeded his warnings about the rising sea level.  He established Ark, the ice caps melted, and his new city was high and dry, seemingly the last remnant of human civilization.

Noa, the authoritarian leader of the tightly controlled community of Ark, believes that language was the root of all of humanity's problems.  ""Our aim is to curtail the use of language,"" he tells Letta, who becomes the Wordsmith after her mentor disappears.  ""As you know, throwing words around is quite irresponsible, considering our history.""  His public agenda is to limit language to The List, a list of a few hundred words.  His private agenda, which Letta eventually catches wind of, is much more insidious.

The List isn't bad.  It checks all the boxes for the genre.  Noa is a caricature of the evil dictator with a charming side.  The central planning and the enforcers of societal structure are stock as well.  The List is not wholly cookie-cutter, but it was not original or well-written enough for me to love it.

He wants you to like him and believe he's a mensch, but a highly gifted and slightly eccentric mensch. He succeeded.

This is not a literary book.  It is a conversation, with all of the self-absorption along with more than a little self-deprecation that such introspections typically bring.  But, Feynman's work product continues to be a huge force in physics today and he worked with and knew many of those more publicly exposed scientists of the 20th Century. That makes the conversation worth listening to without the speaker picking up the bar tab. His science is wonderful.  His morality...not so much.

Reading the book, it is almost impossible not to draw comparisons between what Feynman was able to achieve under the conditions and tools available to him at that time, and the work of some of the leading public science advocates today.  Feynman doesn't lose in the comparison.

4030,"I pick up books for the strangest reasons sometimes. In this case I saw Rae Davies comment on my blog and I clicked her link and found out she was a mystery author. The cutesy cover of her first book in this series, Loose Screw, got me interested, but it was the first class mystery that kept me hooked until I clicked the last page on my Kindle.

Lucy Matthews is a crime reporter turned antiques dealer, who one day stumbles across a body. When her ex-boss asks her to follow up the murder for a story she reluctantly agrees and ends up knee-deep in a murder investigation.

This was a really fun mystery. I could completely relate to Lucy in her love for her pets and the way they boss her around. I live in a family of two cats and one hamster and even the hamster knows I'm a pushover.

The mystery felt well plotted out and I really enjoyed the combination of Lucy and Detective Blake. I sure hope there is more romance between the two of them in later books in the series.

All in all a good read, and I plan to read the next book to see what adventure is in store for Lucy Matthews next.",4,"[-4.010319328656938, -2.3456431380179126, -1.4096355770748155, -1.0024465615099167, -1.0247944638416062]",-1.0024465615099167
991,"I heard the author on NPR and the idea sounded interesting so I downloaded the book.  It hooks from the first page and is truly a ""page turner"" -even on an ipad.  Great story with a movie certainly in mind.  (In fact, the author admits it is in development.)  One can almost read the proverbial,  ""Cut!""  The story  blends all the best ingredients - a hero rising from serendipity, a good romance, aliens, a thoroughly bad guy, treachery, space and action.  I've seen this described as a sci-fi action thriller which is pretty accurate.

The writing is unusually mature.  The hero's slow but steady involvement with the powers that be proceeded logically and slowly.  The romance was equally well-timed.  He let the story tell itself without going into a lot of declarative description.  The events revealed the history of the future world where all is close to  being lost.

 ****  spoiler alert  ****  A sense of mystery pervades the story.  Why did the aliens build the elevator?  Why in Darwin?  Why infect mankind with the plague yet allow for a group of healthy survivors?  And why return on their strange time frame and build another?  Are there others still alive that Darwiners have not found?

Problems arise in the translation of elevator construction, design and movement into text.  It reminds me of stories set in space ships with up, down, bulkheads, halls, tubes, etc.  I finally gave up trying to follow the various machinations that occurred along the elevator (rising, falling, detaching, turning, rotating, etc) and settled down for the tale.  The chase scene (for that's what it was) could be cut without affecting the story.  Can't wait until the sequel.",4,"[-3.742731603623977, -1.2714421828112643, -1.7426448310627796, -1.0024587152764062, -1.2249041175124042]",-1.0024587152764062

From a Protestant family, we were taught to have little to do with any Catholic notions that elevated the Virgin Mary to any importance other than serving as the Mother of the divine child. Yet for some reason I still felt somehow connected to this wonderfully moving, if not completely accurate cinematic re-telling of the appearances of the ""Beautiful Lady in White"" to three peasant children in Fatima, Portugual in 1917.

Finally with its long awaited release on DVD last month I was greatly looking forward to viewing it once again, albeit this time with much older, critical eyes and a markedly more jaded and cyncial mindset. Now having viewed the '52 religious classic all I can say is I must be an old softie after all. The three children are delightful, particularily Susan Whitney (Lucia) in her one and only film appearance, as is Gilbert Roland as the amiable, though historically fictitious town drunk Hugo.

'The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima' has held up well through the years and still remains one of the great religious films of all-time.

Many of the leading medical scientists of the time who fought the plague, are depicted. The politics of the time, heavily influenced by wartime decisions, are highlighted. The author is not bashful about asserting his own sometimes surprising opinions as to how the strategies of war adversely affected the fight against influenza.

Instead of a detailed analysis of Montaigne's philosophy this is largely a review of the historical context in which Montaigne wrote. There are quotes from his epic series of essays as well but generally the author rephrases his main points. I thought the portrait the author paints of the era (roughy from 1550 to 1600) was very interesting and well written. She describes Montaigne as the first modern man and after reflection on his work I tend to agree with her.

In addition to the historical information I also got a get glimpse into Montaigne's life which was quite interesting as he lived during a succession of religious wars. Much of his philosophy seems very relevant today.

1534,"THE VEIL brings a fresh and interesting world as it's an interesting blend of dystopian and urban fantasy. So, pretty much the perfect combination in my book. There's a whole lot going on between the paras, human magic users, the Veil itself, and the Containment control and oppression over everything. What really interested me was that so many chose to stay in the zoned French Quarter. It's made clear that the ""outside"" world wasn't affected much and yet so many chose to stay behind with limited resources and constant struggle.

Claire made for a really interesting character. At the start of THE VEIL, she knows about her own ability but is living in hiding. Despite having these unwanted abilities with magic, she's still rather prejudiced about other magical users and the paranormal world. Granted considering what magic and paranormals cost her, I don't blame her one bit. That being said, her eyes are slowly opened in this book and I really enjoyed her progression from almost naive with a huge lack of confidence, to someone decidedly stronger by the end of the book. It was interesting to watch, and I can't wait to see how she grows even more over the next few books. Speaking of interesting characters, the supporting cast was very well fleshed out. From Claire's best friends, to their enemies, the paras, and an interesting newcomer, Liam, every single character really stood out, only further serving to hook me into this new series.

I enjoyed this start of a new series from Chloe Neill. While she's most known for her Chicagoland books, I can see these books becoming every bit as popular.

So here he finds himself, living back home, divorced and now that he admits it, more than fifty pounds overweight. Addicted to cheese puffs and food in general, he decides he needs to make some changes. When Lindy, the art teacher at Blue Ridge High, approaches him to leave a poster on the library's bulletin board about a supper club for overweight individuals, he decides this may be the way to start. Soon, the five members meet and decide to call themselves the Flab Five. In addition to Lindy and James, they are Gillian, part vegetarian and manager of the Yuppy Puppy; Bennett, US Postal Service carrier; and Lucy, assistant at the sheriff's department. When they hear about the death of the town's high school football hero and all around bad boy, Lucy wants to investigate...her goal with her weight loss is to become a deputy not just an office worker. In support of her, they find themselves in the midst of an investigation that seems to be pointing to an innocent girl, Whitney. Are they able to figure out who really killed Brinkley or will this be their own downfall. The story goes back and forth between the mystery and the townspeople involved in it and their own weight loss angst situations. There are some wonderful diet recipes throughtout the book. For anyone who has ever struggled with weight loss and food addictions, this book hits the spot with the Flab Five's daily battles to lose the pounds.

738,"This book was highly enjoyable; far more than I initially expected!

For the most part, I really enjoyed the heroine, Seraphina. The whole thing with the garden in her brain was a little strange, but not so much so that it made the whole thing unenjoyable. Her musical abilities were interesting and quite well done, honestly. Her role in the dragon world was also very interesting.

The hero, Kiggs, was a really great character. He was very enjoyable and I definitely rooted for them to get together. There was quite a bit of tension, but not too much that I didn't believe it or felt like it was overdone. In fact, I do wish there had been more - all I wanted was for it to happen!

The secondary characters were where the book really excelled, though. I really enjoyed the other half-bloods in the story, especially as they became more and more relevant and befriended Seraphina.

The political intrigue, surprisingly enough, kept me very entertained. I'm usually the first person to scorn politics, but it remained very interesting during the entirety of the book. It was well-done and had enough twists and turns that I kept wanting to read.

The dragon mythology was very interesting. It was very different from other dragon books that I've read previously and for this, I remained very entertained. I very much enjoyed the family dynamic. The way half-bloods play into society was also interesting. I love that the world and the culture was so well done.
I highly look forward to future books from this author, especially those dealing with Seraphina and her world.",4,"[-4.273795652385215, -1.9488282340543723, -1.4085815870481302, -1.0054419227019649, -1.0055760724920475]",-1.0054419227019649

Who can you trust?? To me this is part of what this book is about, as in the story the protagonist, Tracie Tanner finds herself in this tenuous situation. She is only supposed to deliver a letter from Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to the U.S President Ronald Reagan, but what occurs along the way is very frightening. Why would Gorbachev be sending a letter that no one knows the content besides him. Tracie is ordered not to open the letter under any circumstance and as a CIA agent she does what she is assigned to do and protects that letter with her life.

The other part of the book to me is loyalty.
Loyalty
""Faithfulness or devotion to some person, cause or nation.""

Tracie is rescued by a young, air traffic controller, Shane Rowley. He pulls her out of the plane that crashed suspiciously as she was on her way to deliver the letter. Unbeknownst to Shane, he will be on the ride of his life. These two people are both very loyal to their country so they will do whatever it takes to see that the letter reaches President Reagan.

Parallax View takes the reader on the ride of your life. I was around of course in 1987 so I remember the Cold War mostly from movies and books. This finely researched and written fictional account of the CIA, KGB and higher up government officials in the year 1987 make for a fast paced page thriller that I could not put down.

9729,"My dog is on medication that causes her to drink a lot of extra water.  While I do my best to take her out frequently, she occasionally has accidents anyway.  Her old crate had a crack in the bottom tray so it was useless for keeping urine off the carpet.  Plus, I recently moved to a new house and needed to move the dog over separately from her pen.  So I needed a functional crate for her.  I went with the 48 inch crate (single door) since she is a full grown Rottweiler (about 85-90 pounds).  There was a bit of additional room for a water dish and toys, and my dog was able to stand up fully, turn around, etc., but not to go wild in this crate.

This crate was the perfect size.  It was easy to put together and it was sturdy once assembled.  (It comes with a divider in case you are training a large-breed puppy.  So you only have to buy one crate instead of a series of larger and larger ones as your puppy grows.  Instead, you can just move the divider.  I am not using the divider since I bought this for an adult dog.)  The door is easy to open and close and the coating on the bars is smooth and unbroken.

In the end, I was really happy with this.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  It replaces a much older crate used for something like 12 years and I definitely believe I will be getting at least that length of use out of this one, if not more.

What I got was something much slower, a cautious dance between two people who at first dislike each other but slowly begin to admire each other in their infrequent meetings, and later begin to love. However, I enjoyed the dance very much. The slowness of the relationship made me want it to happen more intensely, and when it finally did, about 4/5 of the way through the story, I was elated.

jennifers review

The Lie weaves a suspenseful tale about Emmanow going by the name Janewhose horrific experience while on vacation in Nepal has come back to haunt her five years later.

The story goes back and forth between current-day Jane and past Emma. Although it took me a few chapters to figure out that Jane and Emma were the same person, I came to an appreciation of the way the story was told. If I hadnt seen what Emma went through first-hand, it might not have been so moving.

My only complaint is that both the past and the present were written in present tense. That didn't make much sense to me. If its the past, why not use past tense? It would have been less confusing to get into the story.

Once I got into the rhythm of the story and past my confusion, I was completely immersed in Jane/Emmas tale. The suspense and action were a big part of what grabbed me, but I think the best aspect of The Lie is the rich characterization. Every character had their own secrets, motives, and psychological issues. This is a book where you either love or hate the characters, but you don't know who can be trusted.

The story is fast-paced, but the author doesnt neglect setting or character descriptions. I felt like I could see everything that Emma saw.

At times I felt that Janes story was a disruption. I wanted to get back to what was happening in Nepal. That might just be me, though, because Jane was certainly in danger in the present day. Its not like her peril was less interesting or less concerning. I did like that the reader is kept guessing about who might be after Jane. Still, I was worried about Emma and needed to get back to see what was happening to her and her friends.

Overall, I really enjoyed reading The Lie. I think it would appeal to many readers, especially those who like stories of betrayal and deceit. I give The Lie four and a half stars. It would have been five stars if it weren't for the rough start.",3,"[-1.824085635718124, -1.0725276861435136, -1.2614419403486177, -1.0058044334634295, -1.5635057601502031]",-1.0058044334634295

1403,"Back Blast is Mark Greaney's 5th installment in the hugely successful Gray Man series. Court Gentry has finally made it home to the USA, intending to get to the bottom of his original termination order. Greaney's been hinting at this backstory since book 1, and finally delivers the goods. Denny Carmichael, Gentry's nemesis comes at him full throttle, including using foreign agents on US soil. While old standbys such as Zack and Hanley play major roles, there are new players such as a new operator and a young, ambitious CIA ""suit."" Gentry does DC, gray man style and the action is non-stop and intense.

The Gray Man tradecraft is nearly over the top, from knocking off an Aryan drug house to intervening in a convenience store robbery. At the same time, there are various perspectives trying to piece together the story beyond Gentry, including other CIA staff and newspaper reporters. All this is set against a backdrop of realistic news reporting (mostly CNN) that is mostly spin, but eerily familiar with today's headlines. There is even a short interlude of father - son bonding gray man style. Gradually, the story behind Back Blast (an old Gentry mission) unfolds, but not before several unique and unexpected twists and turns. The final denouement is both thrilling and climatic, worthy of a multiple installment spanning story-arc.

With successful resolution of the gray man status that drove the previous series of escapades, Court is ready to start a new chapter in his life. While he is reunited with his former boss, he has a new handler and seems primed for new adventures.",4,"[-4.391192980200047, -1.4570894186022603, -1.8496094616803016, -1.0058943501831932, -1.0089844195263562]",-1.0058943501831932

2252,"If you are a political observer who has been puzzling over the odd demographics of the Republican vote, this is the book for you. Beginning in the era of Ronald Reagan, some voters left the Democratic party bloc vote to swing to the right.  These ""Reagan Democrats"" did so, it was commonly assumed, over social issues;the right-to-life movement, gun control legislation, and so on.

  Frank writes of the territory he knows best, the state where he grew up, ""heartland"" Kansas.  His title is a quote from an essay written by an early twentieth-century Kansas journalist, much esteemed in his time, William Allen White.

  I had been scratching my own head in wonderment over the irony that Frank describes again and again:  Why are these people--farmers, union workers, and lower middle-class working people, some of them with truly hardscrabble lives-- voting against their own interest and aligning themselves with corporations, big money, oil and banking and pharmaceutical conglomerates?  When and how did this hoodwinking of the electorate begin and how does it continue?

  Frank's analysis will surprise and enrage those on the left.

Our two-party system is to be lauded and preserved; the best way is to open up an honest dialogue, to educate people about the agendas of each party--especially the economic agendas. The Republicans have fanned the flames of social issues which cannot be quickly and satisfyingly resolved at the ballot box but are to be decided by the courts over many years. The Democrats, striving to be the party of ""inclusiveness"", have taken in zealots whose stands on social issues are distasteful to voters. The Democrats also have taken in upwardly-mobile, educated baby boomers, who are perceived by the old-time Democratic blocs to have a patronizing attitude of ""We know what is best for you,"" rather than, ""We are in this together.""

The bottom line persists: It's the party of the people v. the party of wealth and privilege.  It's time to get back to basics, time to clear away the Republican social-issue smoke screens and to unite the Democratic party on its original solidly strong base. Frank's book can help.",4,"[-1.8613163408473528, -1.5754251889946065, -1.876674471215725, -1.0060409806933763, -1.1155850209098395]",-1.0060409806933763

This time around, Cotton is drawn into a conspiracy involving China, North Korea and the U.S., all relating to some documents that may prove the illegality of the American government's right to tax income, as outlined in the 16th Amendment.  Berry as usual does an excellent job of incorporating a nice mix of history and conjecture to advance the story, and Malone remains a likable lead.  Both FDR and Andrew Mellon play significant roles in the book, and Berry has obviously done his research in terms of some of the historical elements included.

The whole story takes place over a period of about 24 hours, which keeps the action going but also makes for a number of sequences that challenge even the most willing suspension of disbelief.  I'm all for a fast-paced read, but I would have appreciated a little more meat on the bones in this one.

7611,"The good:  Logitech is the first word out of my mouth. As a rule, they build solid, dependable products. We have two Logitech keyboards that we use and like. This is a Bluetooth keyboard, which means cordless. Having a keyboard on the Mini means that you have the full Mini screen to see what you are typing rather than the portion displayed above the Apple keyboard. The stand also makes a more comfortable viewing and typing position--like you are using a mini-laptop or netbook. You've got quick keys, which speed up the process--even quick keys especially for the Mini. The keyboard is fairly responsive--more so than the iPad keyboard for me.

The bad: As a touch typist, the keys feel a bit close together. If you use a standard keyboard, this might feel crabbed at first--particularly if you have big fingers. I personally think the Logitech keyboard is better than the iPad's, but you really are going to have to watch hand-cramping when you use it and make sure your wrist posture is correct. (I am particularly sensitive to this since I have Carpal Tunnel in both hands)

The heavy:  If, like me, you bought a Mini because the standard iPad was getting heavy, this keyboard will make your Mini top out at just a bit above a pound.  (Mini without WiFi is 10.8 ounces, the cover adds 7.2 for a total of 18 ounces) This may be better once I get done with carpal tunnel surgery, but right now--I am leaving the keyboard behind and using dictation unless I know I am going to need it.

Overall, I think the Logitech keyboard is going to be a useful addition to the iPad Mini. The weight it adds should be offset by its better efficacy as an input device.

Maggie Holloway is reunited with her stepmother whom she had lost contact with years ago. Maggie runs into Nuala Moore her stepmother while attending a friends family reunion.  Maggie and Nuala are excited about reconnecting and having a chance to catch up. Before that happens Nuala is murdered in her home.

Thia book has just enough creepy and some mystery to it. As Maggie is dealing the the tragic loss of Nuala she starts to investigate some odd findings she comes across. Centered around this is Latham Manor.  A retirement type place that Nuala suddenly changed her mind about moving into just days before her murder. Living there also was Nuala great friend Greta Shipley who died shortly after Nuala.

Odd things are going on like people wanting to buy Nuala home. Elderly people also given bad investment information and losing thousands of dollars. Even though I had an idea as to who the suspect was and was correct I still enjoyed this book and glad I borrowed it to read.

I did enjoy the love interest story line between Maggie and Neil. The fact that it was not all mushy and the realization of how things were--feelings was nice. Book was a tad slow but really started to pick up as it got closer to the end. Earl was an interesting person and I can picture people thinking he was odd or eccentric but his family background does make sense to his hobby and interest. Gives the story more of a creepy element.

But why is this person contacting them?  What are the real motives now of someone who had treated the two siblings  and everyone else  so cruelly when they were children?

Willett does an excellent job with characterization; readers can easily see the characters, and I liked the idea of the characters being older.  The setting is just as clear; even readers who have never been to Cornwall can imagine the setting as they read.  The way Willet handles the plot is also excellent; readers visit events in Billas and Eds childhood and wonder, too, who this person contacting them is and why he wants back in their lives.

Professional reviewers have compared Willetts work to Rosamunde Pilchers and Maeve Binchys.  This work shares some qualities of these authors works, but it is distinctive because it does have a  thriller vein; readers wonder, too, what the person sending the postcards really wants and must be patient as Willett reveals information.",4,"[-2.6115492015012665, -1.4396871156638589, -1.6498064454158925, -1.0074873297766167, -1.103319876486775]",-1.0074873297766167

I wouldnt start with this one because youll miss out on character and relationship development; plus, the cases from the previous two books are brought up so you couldn't go back and read them later without knowing what happened. I recommend reading this series in order.

I listened to most of this on audio but finished the last quarter on my kindle and I have to say that, given the choice of narrators, I recommend the print version over the audio. The book chapters are told from two different first person perspectives Serenitys and Daniels, but mostly Serenitys. There are different narrators for each, so the same characters have different voices depending on who is reading the chapter. Its a bit annoying. Also, the voice for Serenity doesnt match her character. Its not strong enough. She would probably be fine for a different book but I didn't care for her as Serenity.

I have to put a disclaimer on this review by saying that I am not a Johnny Depp fan and am really getting sick of him playing the same role over and over. Having said that this movie is deceiving. The preview made it seem like it was a comedy, while there are funny parts this is not really a straight comedy. I never saw the TV show so I wasn't sure what to expect but to me the movie had the feel of less funny ""Death Becomes Her"" as far as comedy goes. To me the best parts were the old maid who doesn't speak at all and the soundtrack (as well as Alice Cooper). There were some pretty funny lines and Depp did do a good job but this is his typical character lately so I can't really be impressed by his acting. I will admit though that if you are a Johnny Depp fan then you will probably really enjoy this movie and totally disagree with my review. As far as my feelings I thought it was a little slow moving and seemed confused as to whether it wanted to be funny or not.

His true identity is unknown to the public as he had made a pact with an Elvis-impersonator that went wrong.  Elvis's friend Jack (Ossie Davis) is the only one who believes that he is the king, but Jack also believes that he is the John F. Kennedy.  Elvis is currently bed-ridden in the nursing home as a result of a stage accident where he broke his hip three years ago.  Between sleeping, eating, and using the bed pan Elvis has bizarre dreams and visions that often launch philosophical thoughts of getting old and its consequences.  This monotony crawls under the skin of Elvis as he decides to get out of the bed and use the restroom for once.  However, it seems as if Elvis's adventure to the lavatory leads to a darker secret that seems to drain the life out of the residents of the nursing home.  Bubba Ho-Tep is a comical and well-written horror story that the director Coscarelli adapts to the silver screen with a delicate touch of humor and suspense.  The comedy is improved with Bruce Campbell's performance as Elvis, which will give the audience reason to burst out in loud laughter several times.  Bruce Campbell also brings out a raw, but sensitive side of the old Elvis that suffers from health problems and other dysfunctions that comes with age.

Not so much by Leila's...it was a surprise but it didn't change the tone of the story for me. Jackson's secret started out benign, but I knew there was more to it, judging by how much more book I had left to read. The fallout from this secret changed how I looked at both Jackson and Leila...and it seriously hurt the previous love I had for one of them.
Ugh, I can't say more without spoilers. I did enjoy the story, I look forward to the next in the series, I still love Violet and her writing, plot twists and characters. But there was a little too much drama for me. 3.75 stars.

1221,"Michael Crummy's quirky ""Galore"", with  sparks of brilliant writing was, unfortunately for me a considerable let down.  Landscapes and human prospects are equally bleak in a town ironically know as Paradise Deep and one more aptly named neighbor,  Gut.  Inhabitants are invariably (and soon) tiresomely quirky.  Characters like Devine's Widow, the matriarchal wiccan contrasted to a drunken and sybaritic RC Father Phelan.  Protestants v. Catholics and children like Mary Tryphena grow to marry not their heart's love but the washed ashore detritus that reeks of dead fish. Good luck...

Indeed Mary Tryphena, Judah and Absalom are the exception, being somewhat fleshed out.  People sort of float in and out without much purpose except to move the years along.  Crummy never stays with anyone very long so Judah may or not be a lucky talisman; Jabez Trim and his wife ache for children and ultimately succeed but we hardly know of their joy.  Indeed, joy and even satisfaction are noticeably absent from the lives any of these Labradorians.  Everyone just sort of drifts from crankiness to misery to shortage to bad weather-- flotsam in nature's harsh and uncompromising universe.

I don't think it necessarily bad that the author depict something so dreary and unpleasant, but I would like to know why anyone in their right mind would want to stay in such a harsh and depressing place. Habit?  Lack of imagination? Masochism?  When Absalom is banished for falling in love with his first cousin I wanted to shout ""run, Abie run, and don't look back.""  Banishment seemed like the lotto jackpot.  Unfortunately we don't know what ties these folk to such a miserable and forbidding place.  And that is a pity.

3108,"On the recommendation of the Amazon community, I picked up _Destiny Disrupted_.  In a word, it was marvelous.  Ansary aims to write a history of the Middle East from the perspective of the Middle East and succeeds brilliantly.  His writing is almost conversational (writing for a broad audience rather than an exculsively academic one), but his treatment of the subject is thorough and comprehensive.  The first four chapters alone are worth the price of the book, as he gives the best summary of the birth, growth and expansion of Islam I have read.  What a treat, then, to have an additional thirteen chapters discussing the intellectual flowering if Islamic thought and the later challenges and crises the Islamic world faced after 1000.

Most readers, however, will want to read the last few chapters in which he explains the intellectial and political divisions within Islam, and the role (as both proxy and perpetrator) the United States plays.  In particular, his treatment of the American involvement with Mossadeq in Iran (coupled with our involvement with the Suez crisis in 1956 and the material support for Israel in 1973) should be mandatory reading - it does much to explain the mistrust and frustration (notice I don't use the word ""anger"" here) the Islamic world has towards the US and our policies in the Middle East.  I was also struck by his treatment of Israel; it is uncommon to find a writer who is able to explain the myriad of forces at work there with as much objectivity as Ansary does.

In brief, Ansary shows that there is no ""clash of civilizations"" between the West and the Islamic world, but rather ""the friction generated by two mismatched histories intersecting.""  I wholly agree.  If we are to ever understand each other, the first place we must begin is by understanding each other's histories - and better still, to empathize and see how events and actions have not only influenced, but been perceived by the other side.  Ansary's work is an excellent effort in this regard.

I was more than pleasantly surprised by this book, #5 in Harris' ""Vampire"" mystery series about Sookie Stackhouse, a ""gifted"" waitress with a penchant for danger and deadly (or should I say, dead) men.

Gothic appeal aside, this book was full of interesting characters, inventive plot twists, and out-of-the-ordinary occurrences -- including an Elvis sighting. I love an author who creates a world and pulls the reader into it completely, and Harris does that here.

7919,"Okay, the laptop desk, at a price under $50. What are you getting? Well, first off, it is supremely easy to assemble, so no worries there. It isn't very large at all, so depending on your needs, this could pretty much fit anywhere you need it to in your home. I bought it for my girlfriend to have something fairly small and simple for her laptop when we are in our living room. It looks pretty nice in a minimalist sort of way. So, those are the basics. The two little drawers you see in the picture...those aren't actually drawers per se. They are actually cloth bins that fit in those slots. The picture is a bit misleading in this regard. Also, i wouldnt call this desk unstable, but i wouldnt treat it too roughly either. It isn't very heavy, and i question its durability if you were to really put it to the test. The only other thing i would say is that if you are a bit larger (like me for example at 6'4"" tall), this desk is decidedly not for you. For my girlfriend who is 5'6"", the size is perfect. So, when considering this desk, take these two things into account: your size and how durable do you really need it to be.
Anyways, i don't feel like you can go wrong as long as you know what you are getting going in, so if this seems like it will work for you based on that criteria, then i definitely recommend this desk overall.

In this reality, the American Revolution never occurred and all is British and bleak. The rewinders must only observe the past and never risk changing anything. Obviously, thats what happens.

Rewinder is a generally good twist on the much used themes of alternate history and time travel. The historical references and detail ring true and give the story weight.  Within the time travel elements, there are plenty of paradoxes and self-duplications. Battles just explains them away as thats just what happens when you time travel and they don't matter.  It does make you think about the difficulty of it all, that even a small change could affect everything.

The story is written in the first person, present tense, so you are inside the main characters head the whole time. This can get claustrophobic at times. Other times it gets tedious, as he enters our time and explains what we call phones and cars. Uh, we know what a car is.

Narration by Vicas Adams, who does an adequate job. His voice has a specific tone and quality that took this listener some getting used to. It is recommended that you listen to the audio sample and decide if this is a deal breaker. The production quality is excellent and he is certainly a professional.

Rewinder is not ground breaking, but is a pleasant listen. At about the length of a cross country plane flight and back, it is easy to stay with it.

497,"In the second book in this trilogy by Beth Revis, Elder is now the ""Eldest"" and is in charge of Godspeed and ensuring its survival to make it to Centuri-Earth. Amy, who was prematurely unfrozen, is trying to come to terms with life aboard the ship and misses her family and being on Earth. When it looks like they might be closer to their destination than anyone thought, she becomes excited and will do anything to get off the ship. Meanwhile Elder tries to be the best leader he can be, but was he born to lead?

I absolutely loved the first book, Across the Universe. I seem to read a lot of YA fantasy but not a lot of YA science fiction and that's part of my strong affection for this series. The other part is that the idea of leaving earth in Godspeed for another planet, hopefully a better planet, is such a fantastic idea and I've loved watching this play out.

For me, A Million Suns was even better than the first book. Across the Universe  set up the story and it really developed into a fast-paced thrilling story in A Million Suns. Through Elder and Amy we learn more about the secrets behind Godspeed and some of the secrets were definitely edge-of-the-seat earth-shattering! There were quite a few ""Oh My"" moments as I read faster and faster to the thrilling end.

I liked Elder a little less in A Million Suns. He needs to stand up and be a leader and he has to make some tough decisions, but there was something that didn't quite connect with me. However, I continue to like Amy. She's so anxious to get off Godspeed at any cost and she faces some tough decisions in this book and comes out on top.

675,"I have been a fan of Lincoln Child and Douglas Preston since I read RELIC, the first book in the Pendergast series.  That particular series has provided me with hours of thoughtful entertainment, although like any other longer series of novels, it has had its shares of ups and downs.  My favorite still remains THE CABINET OF CURIOSITIES, coincidentally another novel that features a dark and gloomy old mansion. I have also read and enjoyed several of Lincoln Child's individual efforts but remain convinced that their joint efforts in the Pendergast series showcases their best work.

When you first see the cover of THE FORGOTTEN ROOM, it reminds you of the setting of an abandoned insane asylum sitting on a hill, surrounded by the clouds and lightning of a severe storm, and overlooking dark and furious waters.  And yes, there is a light on in one of the rooms.  So I expected an old fashioned 'ghost story' set in an old haunted mansion, massive in size, with creepy rooms and dark furnishings, populated with shifting shadows and whispers in the dark.  It appeared obvious that 'evil' had taken up residence here.

What I discovered instead was quite a different story of mystery and madness based on something unexpected and unusual, an intricate story on its own merits, but deviating substantially from what I expected.  Perhaps my expectations were too high (given the author's previous works), but the teaser (and the book cover) promised something better.

265,"Ever wonder how ancient scripts are deciphered?  RotL guides readers step by step through the painstaking process that led to the decipherment of one such script: Linear B.  The story is a fascinating one, and Fox's telling of it both adept and entertaining.  RotL is part biography (of Linear B tablet excavator Evans; decipherers Kober and Ventris), part history (of the civilization -- Minoan -- that produced the Linear B tablets), part practical guide (on the deciphering of ancient scripts).  The historical part is given only minimal attention.  (Like other reviewers, I, too, would have appreciated more fleshing out of the historical background.)  The biographical parts were -- to this reader -- not overly compelling.  There was nothing especially interesting about Kober's and Ventris' personal stories (as opposed to their personal intellectual histories).  Evans' story struck me as the most interesting of the three, but the treatment was only brief.

Why 5 stars still?  Because the practical guide to decipherment bits of the book, which form the greater part of the book, are exceptionally well executed and fascinating.  Moreover, the threading of these bits in and among the biographical ones makes for a very lively and compelling read overall.

You won't learn a lot about ancient Greece/Minoan civilization from this book.

We Were The Lucky Ones is based on the true story of the Kurc family, as the events of World War II unfolded.  From Radom, Poland, Sol and Nechuma, along with their grown children and their families, struggled to survive during the war by any means necessary.  This book reads more like a work of fiction, but the author's note at the end tells otherwise.  The author chose to punctuate each section of her family's timeline by explaining the relevant historical situations that were occurring during that period.  This layout allows readers the context they need to place the Kurc family in their point in history.

My biggest negative for We Were The Lucky Ones is the length, as it encompasses events from the year 1939 until well after the end of the war.  This does not enable the reader to spend any significant amount of time processing what is occurring and does not tie them to the story.

Dick has imagined a world of the future in which those who die, if they are frozen quickly after death, can be kept in ""half-life"" for a period of time and can communicate with loved ones through the use of a ""protophason amplifier."" In this future, some people have developed strong psychic powers, many working for a company that specializes in sending psychics into businesses to be spies. To protect businesses by counteracting the psychics, ""prudence organizations"" employ people who can sense psychic activity and ferret out the snoopers.

Thus enters Glen Runciter, owner of the foremost prudence organization; his wife Ella, who is in half-life; and Joe Chip, his second-in-command. The company receives a big job on Luna, taking 11 psychic-sensors along, only to be caught in an ambush staged by its psychic competitors. And Glen Runciter is killed, or is he? Everyone else lives and escape back to earth, but then time begins to shift for the 11 survivors, sometimes with disastrous results. And they keep receiving cryptic messages from their dead boss, sometimes written on bathroom walls. Just what is going on here?

This is not your standard sci-fi novel, needless to say. ""Ubik"" is short for ""ubiquitous""--existing or being everywhere at the same time. In the novel it is a product which can be used for almost anything, including an aerosol spray that can halt the killing effects of time-shift. Questions are raised here about the nature of reality and belief, and the reader thinks he has received the answer to the puzzle, until the last chapter. Then, oops, maybe all that was the wrong answer.

Science fiction is often dismissed when critics are choosing ""great"" novels, probably because it tends to be formulaic. Even though his chosen genre was science fiction, Phillip K. Dick didn't always follow the rules. This novel is funny; it gives you some philosophical matters to think about; it keeps you riveted to find out what happens next; its main character is engaging.

When wealthy Darius Rourke first laid eyes on Marianne she was merely a child. But he was immediately struck by her kind nature. And as he watched her grow and mature over the years. He knew she was the woman he wanted as his wife. Now Marianne doesn't seem to feel the same way. At least not a first. She is basically told either merry Darius or watch as her family's lives are destroyed due to her father's unrelenting debt. But as Darius and Marianne spend more time together and eventually merry. An extremely beautiful and natural love blossoms between them. Now I struggled with a lot of the old wording. I mean I knew for the most part what was being implied.

While some of the involved people are nearly 80, they still wield enough power to commit murder, and their  offspring are willing to help to keep their families reputation from being brought down.

 Pros:  Iles story telling capabilities are working at full throttle.  He's one of the best out there that I've come across.

 Cons:  You could, but shouldn't start with this novel.  There are several Penn Cage novels and should should do those first because  he makes vague references to things that happened in them.  This book ends, but is not completely finished.  There are several  parts that I presume will be picked up in the next novel.

7571,"I am writing my review on the Logitech Tablet Keyboard at this very moment.  I am really impressed at how well the keyboard works - it took me less than 30 seconds to set up after my iPad discovered the keyboard via bluetooth.  All I had to do was enter a 4 digit number, push enter, and off I went, typing up notes, writing emails, and entering website addresses with so much more ease than using the iPad's touchscreen keyboard.  The keyboard itself is shaped very similarly to Apple's keyboards, although the keys are a little more rounded on the corners and don't have as good of a ""spring"" as the Apple.  Like most Apple keyboards, the keyboard is smaller than that of a PC's, so users with larger hands may have a more difficulty using it.

One thing I really like about this particular keyboard set is the carrying case.  The carrying case is included and is made of hard plastic.  It completely covers the keys on the keyboard, and packs really small.  The best thing is that it can open up slightly and be used as a prop for the iPad - the design works so hand in hand with the iPad that even with a protective cover on, I can prop up the iPad on this case.  I really can't imagine going back to using my iPad's touchscreen to type up long emails while traveling or on the go - this keyboard is awesome!

702,"Though a number of reasonable explanations have been advanced in recent years, the fate of those lost on the Mary Celeste remains an enduring mystery.

The Mary Celeste was a merchant brigantine found unmanned and adrift in the Atlantic Ocean in the winter of 1872. Missing were the captain, his wife and child and the crew of the vessel. An admiralty inquiry advanced several theories for what happened, including foul play, none of which provided a satisfactory answer.

Valerie Martin has used this mystery to weave an intriguing tale around real life characters involved in the case. Her focus is on the Cobbs and Briggs families, both intricately connected and equally familiar with losses at sea, and with Arthur Conan Doyle, author and advocate of Spiritualism.

Sarah Elizabeth Cobb married Benjamin Briggs, captain of the Mary Celeste, and part of the story is told from her viewpoint. Martin adds a fictional sister, Hannah Cobb, who becomes a medium and her career adds another feature of the novel. Early in his career Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of Sherlock Holmes, penned a controversial fictional tale which is responsible for many false elements of the Mary Celeste legend.

There are other memorable characters, most notably the skeptical journalist Phoebe Grant and Jeremiah Babin, who seeks answers for his own loss through patronage of Violet Petra/Hannah Cobb.

If you're looking for a fictional resolution to the mystery, its not my intent here to dissuade you. I found this journey into a long gone world satisfactory and absorbing.

My negatives, are the hard somewhat flexible plastic windows on the rain fly -- I am worried that will long term folding up of the windows and storage in a garage that often changes temperatures they may crack or become weakened.

1613,"The story of Rosemary Kennedy was not unknown to me since I have been mentioning it to my psychology classes for years.  However, Larsons book provides details of the likely reasoning process that the father, Joe Kennedy, went through to determine to have his eldest daughter receive a lobotomy.  I say the likely process because it remains unknown from the family records how the Kennedy patriarch made his decision.

Current HIPAA laws protect the information on the procedure and the family papers do not make disclosures on this issue.  Therefore, while the author tried to provide as much documented information as possible, based on access to newly released family writings, she can only speculate on how and why the father made his decision.  It does seem clear, though, that he did so without fully consulting with his wife or his adult children.  In fact, the author notes that another of his daughters, Kick, obtained advice against the use of lobotomies.

What I had not before known was that the lobotomy used on Rosemary was not the so-called icepick method.  The infamous, Dr. Freeman, had not yet heard of this form of lobotomy and so he and his partner used more of a traditional surgical procedure of drilling through the side of the head.

The lobotomy is only a small part of this book and the author reserved it for nearly the last section of the book.  Instead, the book rightly focuses on the life and personality of Rosemary Kennedy.  Here, the author gives a portrait of an attractive woman with charm, although, one who was mentally damaged at birth due to poor medical attention.  This was in contrast to what she became after the procedure.

This was a sad story for the family and for fans of the family who would have certainly benefited from her presence if Rosemary neither had been harmed at birth nor had the lobotomy.  As noted in the concluding chapter, Eunice Kennedy established the Special Olympics in Rosemarys name that today assists many thousands of youth and adults.  Also, as president, John Kennedy established the Medical Training Act that worked to assist those with disabilities.  The Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore is one of the outstanding research institutes that assists thousands of children for a variety of difficult disorders including autism, fetal alcohol, etc.

Finally, this book provides a biography on the unknown Kennedy and for her sake, it is about time that she has been allowed out of the shadows.  Good work by Ms. Larson.",4,"[-2.546512586079702, -1.4581737598428974, -1.6632477431571289, -1.0164735794586288, -1.0475139115541667]",-1.0164735794586288

Honest Kitchen is a very good brand and this broth is a great idea.  My dog has been given this as a dry additive and as a liquid broth and it has been wonderful!  I recommend it actually.

Honest Kitchen is a really excellent brand of natural and more healthy inputs for dogs.  I have greatly enjoyed their stuff in the past, even though it is freeze-dried and requires my human to put water, although frankly many times I have the straight dry stuff and still enjoy it on my kibble.

In this case this case, this stuff is bone broth.  I have tried for the chicken version for review and the beef broth my human purchased.  MMMMM.  I got the package and tried to as a dry additive to my kibble,  I loved it.  I ate it all up.  Even dry this is great.  The adding water part is nice and all, and I guess I eat that too, bit for me it sure didn't matter.

However, during a period when I wasn't feeling well, my human gave me the beef broth as a liquid and initials I didn't want it, but then I lapped it up and really loved it.  It was helpful and gave me strength.  I loved it!

I like the ingredients.  Cardamom?  Okay, still works.  Pleasant but slight smell to my human.  For me, this is pretty rich smelling but not as good as the trash cans, hydrants and other places where we leave messages. Call waiting?  Doesn't;t quite work.

However, he quickly throws himself into a murder case at the behest of an old friend and neighbor, Lady Jane Grey, whose former maid, Prue Smith, has been found dead at her new place of employment. Upon examination, it seems that there is much more to Prue's death than meets the eye. While a bottle of poison was found nearby, it was not the cause of murder. And when her suicide note turns out to be a fake, Charles, his friend Thomas McConnell, and those around him begin to look out for the truth.

There are a limited number of suspects in the house: George Barnard, the owner and an executive at the Royal Mint; his nephew Claude, who is surely up to no good; his nephew Eustace, a dour young man with definite political ideas; Newton Duff, a prominent politician; Roderick Potts, a tough-to-crack millionaire; and Jack Soames, an executive at the Pacific Trust. With the help of his elder brother Edmund and his butler Graham, Charles sets out to see who has motive to kill a lowly servant. But with a secret in the house and the death of one of their prime suspects, Charles, Thomas, and Edmund must scramble to put together the pieces to this strange puzzle.

Pros:
Access Point - This is the default mode and worked perfectly in all my tests.  This mode is this unit's main asset and makes it so you can use tablets and smart phones on Wi-Fi.  In addition, you could use this mode at home for guests so you don't have to give out your main password/etc.  Almost a brainless setup in AP mode.  I could get this to operate quickly when using it out of the box in the default Access Point (AP) mode.

Cons:
Repeater Mode - Repeater mode didn't seem to work for me.  After setting it up, it looked successful on the router's web menu page.  However, I used a Wi-Fi channel scanner on both my Android phone and laptop and there was no noticeable difference in the signal I was trying to boost.  Disappointing as this was the mode I was most hoping to use this router for.
Minor Cons:
Bridge Mode - Seems to let you use ONLY the same channel as the parent router.  This is sort of logical since the internal WR700N radio can only use one channel at a time.  If it had 2 radios, it could obviously upload on one and download on the other.  While this mode is still useful, it is not as useful as if it could use a different channel than the bridged signal.

I grew up in the age of the variety show, and The Carol Burnett Show was one of my favorites.  Tim Conway and Harvey Korman could really liven up the stage.  In his memoir, ""What's So Funny? My Hilarious Life"", Conway shares the story of how he found his calling and how he drew from his own experiences and family to bring his onstage characters to life.

If you remember Conway's skits, you will love his autobiography.  You won't be able to read it with a straight face and you will find many opportunities to laugh out loud. He gives us a humorous look into his early life with stories of his Romanian mother and Irish father, a combination that could only produce some very funny situations from which Conway gathered material for some of his comedy routines.

This is one autobiography that doesn't contain a dull sentence in the whole book.  It's not about so much about Tim Conway as it is about all the people in his life who made him the funny man he became.

I had hoped it would fit a skinny 16 year old but it's simply too small in the chest and shoulders as 16 year olds develop more shape than 14 year olds. It would also fit some 12 year olds. Since it's got a higher percentage of cotton, it's comfortable to wear.

They're not the best I've got on hand, but I have to at least double the price to get better. These have a smooth sound with excellent stereo separation. The highs occasionally have just a hint of tinniness, but not always and not much. The bass is quite satisfying. Notes are crisp. There is some distortion (fuzziness) above about 80% volume. That's certainly not unusual in this price range, and it is above the volume I would ever normally use.

The ears are comfortably padded, and despite what I saw in one critical review, I'm wearing them now with music playing and the TV on at normal volume.

can make the management of gastrointestinal issues unnecessarily
difficult.

the book is that the author covers gluten-free foods like millet,
quinoa and soy tapioca. Omega 3 fish oil, flax seed and walnuts
are mentioned as preferred foods to enhance health and well being.

941,"""Seabiscuit"" is a lyrical tale broken into three parts.  In the first part Laura Hillenbrand introduces us to the four individuals who will comprise Team Seabiscuit.  There's Charles Howard, the winning salesman who upon the death of his beloved child loses his passion for cars (his son was killed in a car crash) and discovers a passion for horses, and in so doing brings his competitive showmanship to horse racing.  There's Red Pollard who grew up in terrible poverty just as Charles Howard grew up in terrible wealth; his family ravaged by the Great Depression, Red Pollard decides to ravage his body in order to become a jockey and prizefighter, and he brought to horse-racing a maniacal obsession with the sport and deep sensitivity to the marginalized.  Then there's Tom Smith, the original horse whisperer, who was born a century too late, and as his home -- the plains and hills of the Western frontier -- receded he retreated to the only skill he could market to a modern world that no longer had time and patience for his sort of time and patience with life.  Finally, there's the rascally, lazy, and profoundly talented Seabiscuit, who had the speed and the gameness to win it all all along, but who went misunderstood until Howard, Pollard, and Smith found him.

In the second part, we read about Seabiscuit's anti-climactic ego-driven rivalry with War Admiral.  It's the final and third part that makes this book such a lyrical and memorable read.  Severely hampered by age and injuries, Red Pollard and Seabiscuit make one final bid for the Santa Anita Handicap, the richest prize in all of horse-racing and the race that they should have won but lost twice before.

First off, I've had some issues with the USB side of the cable. The USB connector is loose, I think, so it tends to lose connections. Because of this, it will only sometimes do things like stay connected long enough to download photos to my computer. It's very hit-or-miss. That being said, it definitely comes and goes.

I love the length. 10 feet is probably more than I really needed, but the the flexibility is welcomed.

I also really like how thick the actual cable is. Some are so thin and flimsy that I'm continuously worried they'll break off, snap, get caught in something, or just wear down. Not this one! I don't foresee this being an issue at all.

Randall Munroe, most famous as the cartoonist behind the popular online cartoon ""xkcd,"" has for years solicited questions from the public and then answered them, using science and math, to the best of his ability. Questions range from ""what did Times Square look like a billion years ago"" to ""How close would you have to be to a supernova to get a lethal dose of radiation?"" Some of the questions basically jokes, others are more serious. Some are new and others are old classics (""what would happen if everybody on earth stood shoulder to shoulder and jumped at the same time?"". In every case, Munroe comes up with a creative well-reasoned response. He often finds humor in testing the bounds of the scenarios posed by his readers, and is often self-deprecating (""don't follow my advice on this, I'm only a cartoonist""). His tone is often similar to that of Jon Stewart on The Daily Show, though obviously dealing with science and math rather than politics and media criticism.

Most of my masking was on smooth surfaces (window frames, baseboards; not on the walls themselves), so the texture problem was not an issue for me.

I do recommend doing your best not to slop too much paint around the tape, or to wipe up excess drips from the tape while wet, as the thicker the paint, the more likely it is to stick to the tape and lift off, particularly with latex paint.

When I went to visit my mother-in-law in Florida, I discovered that she had purchased a medical alert bracelet that required an Internet connection. The main unit for the medical device, required that the single Ethernet cable she had, be plugged into the back of the unit. Since I wanted to use my laptop computer, and there was no wireless connection available, I wasn't sure what to do. My brother-in-law, who lives in the same condo complex, let me use his computer to search for something on Amazon that would solve the problem. After searching for a while; I came across this Ethernet switch made by Lynksys and made the purchase.

Setting it up couldn't have been easier. First I plugged the Ethernet switch into a wall outlet. Than, I removed the main Ethernet cable from the medical device and plugged it into port number one on the switch. Next, I plugged the medical device into port number two. Finally, I plugged my laptop into port number three. The only extra items that I had to purchase were two 6' Ethernet cables which I used for the medical device and my laptop computer. The entire set-up took less than 5 minutes and the results were exactly what I had hoped for. I'm able to use my laptop computer at the same time that my mother-in-law's medical device is in use.
