Opening the pages of this book is like taking a journey to the past...one an almost smell the fetid streets, hear the neighs of the horses, see the sights and sounds of turn of the century New York City.
This novel of the rudimentary beginnings of police profiling details the acceptance of psychological methods for solving crimes.  That breakthrough gave psychology and the psychologist (or alientist) a measure of legitimacy.  This is one part history, one part horror and one part detective.  I was literally rivited by both the story and the characters and the ending was one of those tour-de-forces that are both rare and sublime.",2,"[-2.5760345825885076, -1.013506727495158, -0.9706030596592586, -0.9940947858076525, -1.7424130672864369]",-0.9706030596592586

Another detective, who was her mentor and at one point before she joined the police department saved her life, has just been paroled from prison for a murder conviction that eventually proves to have been a wrongful conviction. A serial killer is slowly making his presence known. The female detective is herself under investigation for murdering a couple of men caught with a teenager, kidnapped and assaulted by them. Then there are gold coins, a corrupt prison warden, an 89 year old lawyer, lies and old crimes added to the mix. The story moves quite smoothly and swiftly with all these elements. It will definitely keep your attention. I enjoyed the story very much.

5486,"OK... this was interesting to see how having werewolves in the Marines might work.  There is very little background of the world provided, but it seems as if things are pretty much like our world except for the existence of werewolves.

Lt. Lucas Young is preparing for his second deployment in Afghanistan when the True Alpha of the Marines, Sergeant Noah Hammond, is put under his command at last-minute.  There are signs of attraction but the men have lots of other things to concern them.  For one thing, Lucas hasn't had the advanced training in handling werewolves that he needs, primarily due to an incompetent superior officer.  So, he's finding out about how werewolves and their hierarchy work in the military as it goes.

This is good, because we get to see things along with him.  And he has to deal with how to be an officer in charge of a powerful were who in their society, outranks pretty much everyone.

My quibbles arise after the setup when Lucas continues to remain at times knowing (by instinct, it seems), but also amazingly ignorant of what's up with the weres and the Alpha.  I bought the ignorance at first, but then there are fellow officers who tell him that he can consult with them, and then it seems as if almost everyone else seems to know more than Lucas (they are helping him out, but somehow he remains clueless until things happen).  So maybe they are all better trained--but Lucas now has the training manuals he was previously denied, PLUS he has a relationship with the Alpha and people keep telling him to have a talk with the guy, but that never happens--even when they have some downtime amidst all the action of the deployment.  Then there's a bit of the old ""I like him but I don't think he likes me that way"" going on between BOTH of them thrown in.  I understand that these guys are manly men and don't like talking, but really???  *Sigh*

Anyway, there were lots of interesting things thrown into this book.  I admired the concept and all the complications that could arise from it, but I'm not quite sure it was all executed as well as it deserved to be, however.",2,"[-2.379721223165251, -1.5253229793130298, -0.970668655886733, -1.0122894678016008, -1.421215333853971]",-0.970668655886733

6957,"A great read with plenty of humour between Bruce, a man who has OCD, needs everything perfect and has a routine that is never broken. Until Natasha steps into his life, a reporter undercover at his company trying to get dirt on him so she poses as a potential intern. When he catches her with his banana in the lunch room and turns his perfectly ordered world into chaos, he hires her to make her life difficult, to try and drive her crazy enough to quit. But shes no quitter and she wants the story, but as she gets to know him, his cold robotic ways start to crack and she likes what she sees underneath. Bruce is also stunned at how attracted he is to a clumsy intern who speaks before she thinks but hes been burned in the past and is cautious of giving over himself too much and what will he do when he finds out her betrayal.
A great read that had me laughing out loud at some of the antics and situations that happened between them, the flirting about his banana and the rain checks when things got hot and heavy. I enjoyed this read, the playful banter, the hilarious accidents and how the author drew out their attraction until they finally have what they both want. The ending was perfect for them and I loved how Bruce finally got what he has wanted for many years.

What starts out as a fake fianc proposal and then a forced marriage by the Bear Clan leaders slowly builds up to a romance between Isaias and Rebecca.

The story is of 2 orphans who were separated and then reunited, one living a home life with a mom and dad and one living through foster care.

State, Baylor, Rowe and Miss Tami will hold a special place in my heart forever. The stand up character of State as he lives his dreams but not to the detriment of love. The strong willed and damaged Baylor that found family isn't always with a mom and dad. Sweet Rowe and her tenacity despite deplorable actions. And the matriarch of this clan, Miss Tami with her ability to roll with the times and help everyone she comes into contact with. All 4 of these characters made for one amazing story.

I listened to this book on audio and Veronica Pace can do no wrong. She managed to read a football player, an emotionally wounded woman, a child with Down's syndrome and an elderly woman to perfection.  Her narration skills are truly remarkable.

Though Chris is dubious at first, the two dead bodies in his office when he returns with the client convince him. Chris, Ian (the client), and Zoey (Chris's friend and fellow worker) all end up on the run. The problem, however, is that their foe is an offshoot of the NSA with surveillance everywhere (primarily courtesy of the ability to see the feeds from closed-circuit televisions). The agency is determined to kill in order to protect the secret of its existence. However, one of the employees at the agency (the Working Group) has qualms about what the company is doing: killing innocent Americans. He aids Chris once in an escape and contemplates doing more, perhaps revealing the agency and its new quantum computer.

The book moves quickly from about the tenth page until the very end, and there is little in the way of character development or anything but the chase, which crosses borders and ultimately involves Edward Snowden, Vladimir Putin, a Mexican drug cartel, the FBI, and more. I don't know how accurate all of the technology is, having never myself fled from a US governmental agency with the ability to find people just about anywhere and locate the phone numbers of burner telephones that have never been used, but the pace of the book doesn't leave much time for serious contemplation of the issues involved. (I did, however, notice what seemed to be a fictional clich when Chris at one point demands a dollar from someone to secure a lawyer-client relationship. In reality, there's no need for money to change hands.)

Dexter slips on the disguise of a normal person by having a girlfriend and socializing with co-workers, but he has no real emotion or connection save with his dark passenger and their dastardly deeds.

Sargent Dokes is the one person that it seems Dexter can't fool with his disguise.  Dokes suspects something is wrong with Dexter and begins to tail him to catch him in the act.  This means that Dexter must stop indulging his hobby until the coast is clear.  It makes for many nights hanging out with the girlfriend and her two kids, drinking beer and being a homebody.

A killer comes to town and starts cutting through people.  His style intrigues Dexter and baffles him for quite a while.  He wonders why the killer chooses to kill the way he does and what kind of message he's trying to leave.  Dexter gets pulled into the investigation and the hunt for the killer when one of the police's own goes missing.  Dexter will have to think like the killer he is to find and try to stop this guy.

From page one you'll quickly see how funny, quirky, and sassy Georgie is. She's got that bubbly personality that you can't help but love. Georgie has set out for the adventure of a life time. In search of a husband, she hopes to finally get her mother off her back. She leaves home and ventures to Italy, but she never imagined she'd fall in love with not only the city, but with the beautiful and brooding Gianluca.

Gianluca on the other hand is the complete opposite of Georgie. He's intense, a tortured man whose experienced loss and is still mourning. Never did he imagine he'd let his heart be open to love again, but spending time with Georgie brings him back to life. He's laughing, smiling, and joking around.

Gianluca and Georgie's chemistry is palpable. You can feel their attraction. It wasn't love at first sight either. They develop a friendship which soon turns into something more. Georgie realizes she has a crush, while Gianluca fights his feelings every chance he gets. He wants to be with her, but is truly terrified to give his heart away. He's doesn't know how to.

This was the second book I've read by R.S. Grey (shocking, I know. Sue me lol) but has quickly become one of my favorites. Makes me want to venture to Italy and find myself my own Gianluca *sigh*.

Anyway it is up to Superman in this adventure to foil the evil plans of the mastermind criminal Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) to destroy California. Generally thrillingly done, with a lighthearted feel through most of it, and it is noteworthy that they play a part of the 1977 hit by Supertramp, `Give a Little Bit'.

3291,"Sometimes this story reminded me of the '60s drama ""Peyton Place"".  So many similarities, I'm sure unintentional.  This story basically deals with teen pregnancy and premarital sex among teens...but its deep tacit message delivers so much more.  It's about social responsibility and family values and single parenting and the stress and emotional turbulence single parents of teens face on a daily basis.

I was skeptical about reading this story as I feared it was going to be strictly a YA novel (the cover threw me off).  And while this story DOES address young adult issues, it is not strictly YA reading.  Not even close.  This story gives so much positive reinforcement in living.  So many life lessons dealing with self-respect and having a positive self image.  Communicating with one another...emotionally supporting your teen(s).  Learning from mistakes and accepting, or owning up to those mistakes.  Being responsible....learning to forgive....  The harmful ramifications of holding bitterness within.  The life lessons go on and on.

I thought this story delivered a powerful message.  It was profound and told exceptionally well IMHO.  I loved all the characters but of course related to the adult characters, Jake Manion -42- and Margie -36- (who is sometimes called Maggie, so don't let it confuse you) Bradford.  I loved their story.

I also adored Alex Manion -19- and how responsible he was for one so young.  He's on the cusp of adulthood and accepts his faults and mistakes like a man....yet at times he's so much like the little boy he's leaving behind.  I loved his devotion and commitment to Emma.

This book picks up right where book 1 left off.  We get to see if Nila actually made it to the boundary of the estate to escape.  Once Jethro finds Nila, the mind games continue between the two of them.  Although Nila is able to outwit Jethro, he is quick to put her in her place.  She is indebted to him and he has to make her pay the debt.

I have enjoyed watching Nilas character turn into a strong opponent against the Hawks.  They tried to break her but she is stayed strong and continues with her fight to kill them all one day before they have the chance to end hers.

As Nila becomes friends with Jethros brother Kes, they form a sort of special friendship.  Nila believes that he is the one key to her sanity.  But is he truly who she thinks he is or is just a good actor to get what he wants, that being Nila in his bed?

Jethro does not like that Nila is friends with his brother; he has to learn to understand that being jealous is not a normal feeling for him.  Is Nila getting to the cold heart of his?  We get to see more into his character too.  It becomes clear that Nila and Jethro may have more in common that what we thought.  They seem to both be pawns in this tortures debt.

When Jethro delivers the first debt, he shows a side of him to Nila that she hasn't seen.  Can he truly have a heart?  And when words are spoken and actions are taken, will Jethro or Nila be able to look away?  Then bam, Jethro seems to have taken the one link to Nilas sanity.  Will she be able to recover to continue to fight to the very end?

The graphics are very, very impressive on this game.  The violence is also quite impressive from lobbing off Orc's heads', shoving your dagger in their skull, slitting their throat in a stealth kill...you name it, you will see every kind of violent kill you can imagine in this game.  Personally, I'm OK with that, because I knew what it was going to be like before I bought the game.

Being able to level up skills and your weapons with runes is a very cool idea.  I like the idea that you can't slap on 15 runes and have a weapon that's pretty much going to carry you through the game.  I've seen unlock slots for I think 5.

I love the side missions, gathering intel on the captains you are out to kill, I love the wraith mode, I just really am impressed with virtually all aspects of this game.

About the only thing I don't like, which is my gripe on all hack and slash games is it really boils down to nothing more than button mashing.

When the HMO's CEO, Tim Markham, dies after a hit-and-run accident and the autopsy determines it was a medical injection that killed him, his doctor, Eric Kensing, is the obvious suspect. Not only did Kensing vociferously protest the HMO's cost-cutting restrictions, the victim had also been having an affair with Kensing's wife. When the dead man's family is massacred and Kensing is placed at the scene, only Hardy continues to believe in his innocence.
Glitzky's determination to nail Hardy's client causes a rift between the friends, only partially healed when Hardy's fishing turns up a pattern of suspicious deaths at the hospital, which cannot all be laid at Kensing's feet. Lescroart's thorough research and skill in explaining the complex  tensions between HMO, hospital and patient keeps the story humming even as Hardy's increasingly cozy relationship with the mayor, prosecutor and police strains credibility. Though not one of his best, Lescroart's well-drawn characters - particularly the strong relationship between Glitzky and Hardy - and solid writing make this a fine read.",1,"[-3.1923858479956944, -0.9747237339188454, -1.2788992600176903, -1.023613287166539, -0.9866775133534622]",-0.9747237339188454

This is by far my favourite Kiersten White book!! A fun romantic magical read.

Jessamin was an awesome heroine. Spunky, brave, smart and witty. Despite being seen as inferior by Albion society because she comes from Melei, Jessamin stays upbeat and doesn't let them get to her. She is the best in her class and extremely bright and she relies on no one.

The enigmatic Finn was perfect. Loyal, generous, brave and a true gentleman. Its hard not to love him. He tries to keep away from Jessamin simply because he doesn't want to pull her into his world but he just cant seem to stop himself. He was just an amazing character.

I also have to say that I loved Eleanor. She was such a fun person. Lol. I loved that she was so confident in herself and even though her family thought she didn't have a lot of magic, she still managed some awesome spells. She was a breath of fresh air!!

Unknown is one of those books I simply could not put down before I had devoured the very last word. Although the author takes the necessary time to develop the background, world and plot of this new series, I can honestly say that she keeps the story moving forward all the time. Moments of suspense and action are balanced by some laugh out loud incidents as well as descriptions of the characters having fun.
The gentle touch of romance blends in with and enhances the story and is not at all in your face or overdone.

The characters, and especially so the main characters, are well crafted, believable and the kind that truly grows on the reader. They have to deal with authority, rebellion and moral conflict and living in a kind of medieval setting does not make that any different from what young people deal with today. As for king Ashan and his diplomat, Safeer; they are thoroughly nasty and easy to dislike. Sadly, in the best of situations, there are also the deceitful and those who are not what they seem to be.

8845,"I usually choose the books I read aloud to my children based on what books my nine-year-old son would enjoy. However, he was gone visiting his grandparents for a few weeks in early August and I decided to read The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett aloud to the other kids. I had never read it before *gasp* and I've been wanting to. I hoped that my daughters would enjoy it.

We were all immediately captivated by the story of the rotten, unloved Mary growing up in India. After being orphaned by cholera, Mary is sent to live with a reclusive, crippled uncle-in-law in a sprawling manor in England.

In literature, there is not a much more cryptic setting than a large English mansion filled with hundreds of closed-up rooms and surrounded by locked and hidden gardens. Add the unsettling sound of wailing coming through the walls at night and it's a genuine mystery.

I thoroughly enjoyed the book. The words flowed easily from my tongue as if poetry and I delighted to read it aloud. I especially had fun attempting to imitate the broad Yorkshire dialect of several characters. Her use of gentle sarcasm and irony reminded me of C.S. Lewis in the Narnia Chronicles. The descriptions of the garden were exquisite--capturing the coming of spring perfectly. It made me want to plant something pretty. I thought the message beautiful and inspiring.  I am a new fan of Frances Hodgson Burnett and if my husband was currently allowing me to buy new books, I would order The Little Princess (love the movie versions) right away.

My kids, while they listened attentively for the first half of The Secret Garden, seemed to lose interest once the first mystery was solved. My seven-year-old daughter appreciated the tale the most, as I expected, and once he returned home my son eagerly joined us for our evening readings even though he had apparently read it in school last year and thought it was ""a stupid, boring book"". I'm afraid that my children's appreciation for great literature has been overshadowed by Pixar, Harry Potter and the like and will need to be cultivated more in this house. I, for one, look forward to it.",2,"[-2.315700840444709, -1.1840649803070753, -0.9759931749402189, -1.0642528540649907, -1.2544314152967493]",-0.9759931749402189

At it's core, this is a love story and is at times is sad, sweet and hot.  An extremely traumatic event in high school, the likes if which no one should have to endure, tore Liv and Finn apart and changed their lives forever.

455,"I had read this before, but it's certainly worthy of a second (or even a third) read, because it is among the best of the best of the hard-boiled detective genre.

The cool thing about Raymond Chandler novels is that they can be just as fun to read the second time around as they were the first. The plots are so intricate and convoluted that the twists and turns fascinate, even if the end is known. And the dialogue is just as fresh and clever the second time around.

The mystery here begins with the hiring of private detective Philip Marlowe by a dying millionaire with two wayward daughters. What starts with a simple case of blackmail quickly escalates into multiple murders and an underworld of gambling, pornography, and narcotics. Along the way, Marlowe is enticed by not one, but three, seductresses, and faces down several armed adversaries, all the while maintaining his cool and his principles and staying one step ahead of the game. The ending is somewhat surprising but logical, with all the clues given beforehand.

The multifaceted character Philip Marlowe is subtly and admirably portrayed. He is cynical and sentimental, sympathetic and pragmatic, tough and tender. Just the kind of guy I would like to know if I ran into a spot of trouble.

The dialogue, as always with Chandler novels, makes me envious of Philip Marlowe in the extreme. I certainly wish that I could think of such splendid come-backs on the spur of the moment. Don't all of us wish we could?

For readers today, the plot is slightly dated, because pornography (what would now be considered as soft pornography) and drug use are not as scandalous as they once were. Also, the attitude portrayed here toward homosexuality is subtly derogatory. Still, the time this was written (1939) must be taken into consideration, and the novel could easily be translated into modern day crimes and attitudes and still be valid and believable.

One of the best of the best of the hard-boiled detective genre.",2,"[-4.38992196641374, -1.4562551756669397, -0.9763919871117432, -0.9983522522471461, -1.5049574939467394]",-0.9763919871117432

With very few people in her life that she can trust, she is left with limited options of places to turn, which currently has her knocking on the door of a handsome businessman named Ethan Dane. They have a little history, but not anything that is going to any farther than friendship, because she is too smart and determined not to be the next woman in line for a night in his bed...

Ethan Dane is pleasantly surprised to find Allie Barrington knocking on his door and asking him for a temporary place to stay until she can get back on her feet again. Ethan has been dying to get to know Allie better for quite some time now, and explore the chemistry that has been lurking between them since the first time they met. He thinks that providing her a place to stay might just be the perfect way to do that, only she has no intentions of letting that happen, so he's forced to get a little creative with his efforts. But fate has other things in mind for him, and if she finds out what he is up to he may just lose his perfect opportunity to get the girl he's been dreaming about for so long..

Ethan and Allie's story captured my attention right from the start and had me dying to find out if they'd get their happy ending. The chemistry between them burned brightly from start to finish, and it was clear to see that these two were made for each other, even if Allie didn't think so!

The oldtimers are fighting this incursion, but many have seen the writing on the wall and are gradually moving away. Told through the voice of Mimi, the youngest in the Miller family, we see a hard working family living through what all families live through - Aunt Ruth's agoraphobia, Dad's stroke that leaves him unable to work or communicate and places a huge burden on Mimi to balance her school work, part-time job, and take over his chores on the farm, her brother who returned from Vietnam with what we would now call PTSD and a drug habit, her mother who works 12 hour shift as a nurse, her oldest brother who has graduated from college and visits infrequently, her boyfriend who has their futures all mapped out already...

Quindlen has a way of crafting compelling story-telling from the mundane, ordinary circumstances of life that we all experience. The dialogue is realistic, and the characters are all believable, though we only really get to know Mimi well. Mimi is caught between the pull of her family's land and traditions, and another way of life that will take her away to college and allow her to build a career that doesn't involve staying in this drowning valley.

Chris wants to spend his new life writing music people might actually listen to and remember--for starters, a sonata.

He soon learns his new home comes with a history: Some 60 years ago, the chatelaine of Kilnsgate, Grace Fox,  was hanged for murdering her husband, the town doctor.  The more time Chris spends in her house, the more he comes to doubt Grace's guilt; and the more he comes to doubt her guilt, the more distraction turns to obsession.

 Thus begins a search for answers that will take him into newspaper and court archives, used book stores, the memories of local oldsters, visits to key characters now living in Paris and South Africa, and an unexpected encounter  with the prefers-to-remain-anonymous Fox descendant who sold him the house.  Along the way we'll read excerpts from the ""Grace"" chapter of a book called ""Famous Trials"" and from Grace's own journals written during her  World War II nursing days. Mixed in with all the amateur sleuthing and the conjectures and dead ends that result, we'll also get involved in the writing of his sonata,  the music he listens to, the wines he drinks, the meals he cooks, the landscapes he explores and the married woman he's becoming increasingly enamored of.

Demidov is a former war hero whose only ambition is to serve his country, to defend the worker's paradise, and to guarantee a secure life for his parents and for his wife. Ideological crimes -- crimes of disloyalty, crimes of thought and crimes against the revolution -- are forcefully suprressed without question. And then the impossible happens; in that a different kind of criminal -- a murderer -- is on the loose, killing at will. At the same time Leo finds himself demoted and denounced by his enemies. The only way for Leo to save himself and his family is to uncover this criminal. From this point on be ready to be unable to get up from your chair until you finish this exciting, extremely well-written story (which is based on fact). If you pay careful attention to the early details in Child 44, I think you will (as I did) be able to guess who the murderer is in advance of the ending. This, however, does not detract from the riveting reading experience that Smith has provided in his debut thriller. Child 44 is one of the best books I've read in a while and I highly recommend it to you.

643,"A WEEK IN WINTER, Maeve Binchy's final novel (unless her husband Gordon Snell finds something lurking in her desk drawers or computer files ), tells the story of Chicky Starr's decision to open an inn in the village of Stoneybridge in western Ireland. Chicky does have help - from Rigger, a boy headed down the path to delinquency, and from her niece Orla.

The converted old mansion is now ready for guests, and, during the height of Irish winter, they arrive.  Some are new faces; some, such as Nicola and Henry, are familiar to readers from Binchy's earlier works.  One couple, the Walls (and indeed they do introduce themselves and are known throughout as ""the Walls"") are actually disappointed in the nice, quiet holiday because they'd hoped to win a trip to Paris. Miss Howe, a recently-retired headmistress, cannot be pleased and even leaves a day early.

Binchy submitted this novel only days before she passed away, and, though it is an excellent work, there is a lack of polish that some of her other works had.  Also, thought here are new characters in this novel, readers familiar with Binchy's works will enjoy the ""Oh, I remember them from ....""

Though I can still highly recommend this work, readers of Binchy's works would probably see more polish in some of her earlier works such as Circle of Friends, Evening Class, or Scarlet Feather.",2,"[-3.1701745446234595, -1.5499583773778352, -0.9783980092415782, -1.0273743892651783, -1.5595436629353854]",-0.9783980092415782

I had never before known much about Joan of Kent and the drama surrounding her relationships, but from Campions telling, I gained much insight into what her life might have been like in Englands medieval court. At many points, her story verges on dark, with the ever-present undercurrents of suspicion and jealousy, scheming and manipulation that surround her, but Joan is a character full of strength and determination, ever the diplomat yet unwilling to simply play the pawn in the kings maneuvering. She deserves to have her story told, and I really enjoyed getting to know this portrayal of Joan and the numerous obstacles and challenges she faced and overcame.

In this book Jeremy Logan, who bills himself as an enigmalogist, is hired to find what caused the gruesome suicide of one scientist and bizarre behavior among several others. The hunt for the cause leads to the discovery of a secret room hidden deep within a well-known scientific institute and an old machine of unknown purpose from the 1930s.

When a murder occurs on Ellis Island, Molly is a suspect. By coincidence, the woman whose identity she assumed was from the same small town as the victim. To protect herself and the only friend she made on the ship (who, coincidentally, was also from the same small town), she has to discover the killer. Fortunately, Molly can't walk down the street without running into a suspect, each of whom is acting out his guilt.
Molly's extreme good luck is fortunate since all she knows about the killer is that he had whiskers (and she goes through much of MURPHY'S LAW accusing everyone with whiskers of the crime). (Coincidentally, Molly had gone walking on the night of the murder and seen the murderer).

Second in the series, just as good as the first ...

Not in My Wildest Dreams is the second instalment in the dreams series by Isabelle Peterson.  This book follows Jack's story from when he was discovered until a few weeks after he loses the love of his life Elizabeth.

This story follows Jack and his dreams of being a male model when he was scouted by a modelling agency.  Jack decided to throw in everything he worked for to follow a dream, but its not always as easy as it looks.  He soon finds out that life as a male model is not a road to be taken lightly as its hard work and his family deserts him for his life choices.  Jack takes a chance and works hard at his craft.  This book is written mostly in Jack's POV but does skip a little between characters similar to the first book.

Through Jack's POV you see when he meets Elizabeth for the first time and his thoughts.  For Jack its love at first sight and he wants to make sure that he doesn't lose the only woman that has taken his heart and soul.  Jack fights for his heart with Elizabeth after she chooses Greg her husband of 22 years.

This book was a fantastic conclusion to the story of Jack and Elizabeth and I read the book in one day.  I loved the story and the characters.

2542,"His well ordered life is about to change. Michael Cross is a corporate CEO with a wonderful wife and a successful career.
Then his brother, Alex, gets gunned down and hes drawn into the underbelly of loan sharks and illegal betting.
As Michael digs to discover his brothers murderer, he becomes involved in his brothers business, with all of the ugliness and danger it entails.

A mysterious message has him wondering.
Is his brother really dead? Has to be. He saw the body, saw him buried. The author took me for a spin into the question of life after death, both philosophical and technical.

Other weird things happen and people are out to get him, even threatening the life of his wife. Now the race is on to solve the murder before everything he values is eliminated.

One of the things I enjoyed most about this book was Michael. His character rang true. The author shared his thoughts, which made his decisions and actions genuine and understandable.

I could see where the allure of the dark side of business would captivate Michael. Hes bored with his uptight legal career. Kind of like an early mid life crisis.

And keeping his brother distant in his life, trying to keep his brothers chosen life from tainting his, has left him feeling guilty.

Things took an interesting turn when Michael started getting messages. Messages from his dead brother, Alex. The author had me very intrigued and I wondered if Alex was really dead. As the story developed, I wondered even more. And wished he were alive. His character was very prominent even though he was dead. Very good mystery there.

From his brothers many ex wives to his right hand men, brothers Skinny and Fat Lester, a couple of characters more for show than for muscle, to the villains, of which there were some creepy ones, what youd expect from the illegal side of money exchange, the characters were plenty and and entertaining, to say the least.

One thing I felt was lacking was more about Michaels wife, Sofia. I felt that she needed to play a more prominent role in the story. What I did read about her had me liking her mojo. I hope to read more about her in the next book.

8233,"I really enjoyed reading Steal Me, Cowboy.

Rainey  is on her way to surprise her boyfriend for the last 4 Adam who moved to Missoula, Montana but her old car dies in the middle of Nowhere, Montana and she has no cell reception, water or food so she wait in her car for help.

Rainey has a really funny sense of humor and while she is waiting for another car to come and help her,  this is what she thinks:

""Two and half hours later, I saw a semi in the distance. Should I flag him down and hope he's a good Samaritan instead of Ted Bundy? The truck grew closer, not slowing. In my mind, I could see Special Agent Derrick Morgan on Criminal Minds pinning my picture to a board with a row of other blondes, shaking his head, trying to figure out the common thread in our murders....""

I was laughing so hard while reading this.

Rainey keeps waiting in the hope that a nice little old lady will come to help her but she realize that it's not going to happen so she stop a truck and hope for the best.

Beck Hartner was on his way back home when he sees a car on the side of the road and stop to help. As soon as he sees Rainey is attracted to her but he acts like an ass and they start on the wrong foot, especially since Rainey tells Beck her name is Carolina.

Rainey is also attracted to Beck but she tries to fight the attraction since she has a boyfriend but meeting Beck force her to face the fact that she wasn't happy with Adam for a long time and she needs to make a hard decisions  - should she stick with Adam since they've been together for so long or take a chance with Beck that she just met?

4248,"For a debut novel, it reads like it's been written by an author that has a few bestsellers under her belt! I was riveted to the story, and would've read it straight through, but a girl's got to get a little beauty rest.
Reagan Sommers has had a hard life, but she's a survivor. She proves that by surviving a brutal attack by four boys, injuring two of them before going down for the count.  As she's introduced to the different men who saved her life, she decides she'll never be a victim again. Anthony is the police officer that arrives at the scene of the attack and takes a personal interest in her. With Anthony she's safe, but he's looking for a relationship she can't give him. Silas & Gage own a gym together, and, along with Dexter, Gage's sweet, fun loving brother, they introduce her to the world of boxing. She discovers she's good at it, and, with Silas' encouragement, decides to enter a local match. The only problem is Gage. The more she's around him, the more attracted she is, and he draws her in like a moth to a flame.

But when she finally decides her life is heading in the right direction, tragedy strikes and she doesn't know who she should and shouldn't trust. This novel is about so much more than the world of boxing. It's gritty, rough, and gives us a glimpse into the seedy side of life. No longer knowing which direction to go, she decides to seek revenge on the ones that have hurt her the most. But will she succeed or be dragged further in to a life of darkness?
This novel ends with a cliffhanger, and I can't wait to see what Ashley has in store for the next book in the series, ""Inside Danger"".

1868,"Im always impressed by how Katherine Reays stories begin. One moment, Im wondering when Im going to start feeling the story and the characters, then the next Im completely into everything. She has this way of bringing a character, their unique qualities, and their circumstances to life. While I have read several of Jane Austen novels, I did wonder if I would be lost in some of the details about her characters and how they connected with this story. While The Austen Escape is permeated with Jane Austen in the best of ways, it doesnt simply regurgitate one of her stories. Instead, Reay creates something entirely new and fresh, with a charm all its own.

One of my favorite things about this story is the focus on Marys friendship with Isabel. Although I didn't actually like Isabel very much, the complexity of their relationship and the development it undergoes throughout the story held my attention. Their shared history is explained in such a way that made me feel invested, despite my misgivings about Isabel. Mary herself is an endearing character, even when I wished she would stand up for herself. Her occupation, engineering, is something I know basically nothing about, but Reay makes it exciting and relatable, and dare I say, almost poetic. Engineering and Austen are two things that I would never put together, but leave Katherine Reay to do it with ease and style.

I also must mention the fairytale-like quality of Marys time in Bath. The descriptions of the attire, the customs, the manor house, and Bath itself had me enthralled and add such an authentic feeling to the story. Just the whole idea of an immersive Austen experience is fascinating, and I loved experiencing it along with Mary. The romance is secondary, in my opinion, to Marys personal growth, although it certainly adds a sweet layer to the story, and I would have missed it had it not been included.

The Austen Escape is another winning novel by Katherine Reay. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment reading it. Fans of her previous novels are sure to find another gem in this story. For those who haven't read any of her books, start with this one or start with another  all of her novels have a unique twist, and theres no wrong place to start.

I loved Serving Trouble! It's well-written and fast-paced, and there's an almost effortless feel to the text that made for an easy and engaging read.

The story is vastly entertaining, likely due to the fact that Josie and Noah are such likable, well-rounded, and compelling characters. And let's not forget the chemistry and history they share between them.

In Running Wild, Noah saved Josie from a  bad situation and then later, he shared a pretty memorable night with her...right before he left for the Marines and broke her heart.

In Serving Trouble, Noah is out of the service, after serving two tours in Afghanistan, and he's currently running his dad's bar. He's also haunted by an event he hadn't been able to fix while in the service and overseas. Josie has just arrived back in Forever, Oregon, too, and she's looking for Noah to make good on his long ago promise to help her should she ever need it, and she needs it now. In the form of a job.

I really loved Josie and Noah together. They were both really disillusioned and haunted by some things in their past, and they were a little conflicted by the night they shared together, too, I think. It was easy to see how attractive they still found each other and how much they both cared about each other while also fully aware of all the reasons they still couldn't, and shouldn't, be together.

I seriously loved this book. I loved the story and both main characters, and it didn't take me long to realize this was a book I couldn't put it down. Absolutely loved it.

3213,"I enjoyed Significance, which is about a group of people who are a bit more than human. As other reviewers have noted, this book shares a lot of similarities with Twilight, minus the vampires, werewolves and love triangle. So if you loved Twilight, you'll love this book. If not, keep on moving, don't stop, no...

As a reference for comparison, I think this is as similar to Twilight as Divergent is to the Hunger Games, minus the ending.

This first installment in the series introduces Caleb and Maggie. They make a cute couple and their love and instant connection feel genuine to this reader. Maggie has been through a lot in her 17 years and Caleb has set his dreams aside for the good of his family. They don't have perfect lives, but when they are together everything seems to settle and fall in to place. They battle a great deal together including a relative with a serious crush, a rival clan, and a father who checks back in at the worse possible time.

Throughout the story we're also introduced to a broad cast of characters. I'd like to read their stories, too. I hope Bish and Jenna get a story. There's definitely something there and I'm excited to read all about it.

There isn't a cliffhanger, yet despite the upbeat ending, the remaining five books in the series are proof that Caleb and Maggie's story is a long way from over. I haven't read any of the other books yet, but I hope they contain much more about the other characters and their relationships.

If you're looking for a new series to fall in love with, and you don't mind the Twilight similarities, this is a good place to start.

Yet she did so for Xander to accept her presence first. Angst came from this revelation, thankfully, was short lived, which was a huge positive point for me.

Caitlin Hart returns again and the story picks up right where the first left off.  Caitlin is off on another adventure with three mysteries to solve:  Who had tried to poison her aunt and why?  What was going on with the land development project? And Who is responsible for the dead body she discovers?
The island is caught up in preparation for celebrating Founders Day, Caitlin and Tara's plans for for their store are underway and my favorite...a white cat appears on Caitlin's doorstep who seems to uncannily point Caitlin to all of the clues she needs.",2,"[-3.2620987235287044, -1.6307721013582288, -0.9822803041811259, -1.0077354568003822, -1.3903038190218155]",-0.9822803041811259
846,"Dante (Danny) Valentine makes a pretty good living as a necromancer. Raise the dead, ask a few questions, and terms of the will or suspicions of murder can all be answered. When a demon shows up at her door, points a gun in her face, and summons her to a meeting with Lucifer himself, though, that's way beyond the job description--even though Danny does the occasional bounty hunting job.

What Lucifer wants is for him to track down a rogue demon--a demon who, according to Lucifer, stole a mysterious 'egg' from Hell. If that egg hatches, Lucifer assures Danny that the Earth just might not survive the experience. To help her, Lucifer sends his personal hatchet-demon, Japhrimel to ensure she survives long enough to confront the rogue. Because, unfortunately, he's given his personal word that neither demon nor man shall harm the rogue.

Danny wants to go alone, but her friends insist on coming along. When their journey takes her to the city where her ex-boyfriend lives, he joins in as well. She needs all the help she can get. The rogue has taken over a Mafia family and has plenty of human resources, as well as his own demonic powers, to call on. Danny doesn't seem to stand a chance, especially given Lucifer's promise. Being a woman just doesn't seem enough.

Author Lilith Saintcrow creates an interesting take on the legend of demons. Far from being unmitigated evil, demons like people--and have manipulated their DNA to raise them from apes to something that a demon could socialize with. Of course not all of the ancient legends are false, either--and the hideous power demons hold is dangerous indeed. Dante Valentine is a damaged but sympathetic character, attempting to survive, dealing with her losses (begining with being abandoned as an infant), and torn between a demon lover and the man who once held her heart and then broke it.

There were so many questions I asked myself throughout my reading. Most of my questions were eventually answered and for that I am very thankful. The biggest question was why was Twitch following Lexi? I had my ideas. And they turned out accurate.
My gut had a hard time digesting Lexi's mental state of mind. How can you ever long to be with your stalker? And even after Twitch becomes more than her stalker how can she continue to desire their interactions? She is a caseworker attempting to protect young children from everything Twitch represents.
This book is sad. So many broken lives. So many broken souls. Each life has experienced far too much tragedy and sadness. The only character that was able to tap into a healthier way of coping is Lexi. Maybe because she found a happier ever after.

7647,"Good earbuds for the price, heavy on bass, fit is ok, overall an ok purchase, but not the perfect earbuds.

Fit:
These earbuds are light and fit well but the weight at the back of the neck catches on my hair and does not feel as nice as my SOL Republic earbuds that have a neck band or some other flat ribbon earbuds that I've tried. The size is fine for bigger or smaller necks and they are fairly comfortable and do not fall out of my ears for normal activity. For running, since they don't have over the ear hook I am not sure if they would stay in.
There are 3 other sizes of earpieces that come with them so you'll find one that fits. The on-cord buttons are a bit clumsy too, and not quite the right place - they feel a little off for some reason. The buttons are easy to identify with touch without looking at them. That is a plus as some can get confusing until you get used to them.

Sound:
The sound is pretty good for earbuds. It's fairly heavy on the base, so it's great for hip hop and pop but a little too heavy handed for classical or just plain audiobooks. Usually, I like heavy base when listening to that kind of music but I felt like it was too amped up in these earbuds and the clarity suffered as a result compared to some higher end bluetooth earbuds I've used. But overall it's good for the price.

The charge lasts 4 hrs, a little too less for longer plane rides, but given that I don't use these all the time, they last long enough. It's annoying not to be able to charge my iPhone 7 Plus and use a wired headphone at the same time so I have to resort to using these more than I want.

Overall, given the price I give them 3.5 stars rounded up to 4. But for pure un-distorted listening pleasure I would recommend upgrading to better earbuds.",3,"[-2.341940937376447, -2.011563418978807, -1.076642367005816, -0.9833047048757801, -1.183993621401328]",-0.9833047048757801

So much of what he has to say about hiking rings true as anyone who has been on a hike or a camp out for that matter.  The joy of a motel, with a shower are as heavenly he describes it.

When Bill Bryson moved back to the US, after living years in Great Britain, he came up with the idea of hiking the length of the Appalachian Trail.  He tried to talk anyone and everyone into accompanying him and finally an old and very out of shape friend named Stephen Katz agreed.  Their adventure begins by Katz tossing out many necessities to lighten the load and from that point the reader is happy to tag along on their lengthy excursion.

But Bryson is not all humor, the reader learns many interesting and entertaining facts about bears, the trail, hiking equipment, history, earth science, the changing face of the woods in America, environmental issues, endangered and extinct animals and natural disasters.

The book is broken up into four sections. The sections are morning inspiration, afternoon perspiration, evening exhalation and a few shopping lists.

Morning inspiration  is made up of one line ideas next to a picture. One line is ""Catch a train"" with a picture of some train tracks and railroad tickets. Another line is ""Engage your spirit"" which is next to a picture of a little girl on a carousel.

Afternoon perspiration is made up of ten tips which are one or two paragraphs long and a picture. For example one tip is to have hand cream at your work desk with the idea that it can be offered to others.

Evening exhalation is an explanation by the author of how to deal with a stressful life and the dangers of not addressing that stress. A few shopping lists are lists of books, music, movies and a take to your bed kindness kit

This is a good looking book with some nice ideas to relieve stress. I find the structure a bit confusing and don't really understand the change in format from morning to afternoon to evening.

However, he quickly throws himself into a murder case at the behest of an old friend and neighbor, Lady Jane Grey, whose former maid, Prue Smith, has been found dead at her new place of employment. Upon examination, it seems that there is much more to Prue's death than meets the eye. While a bottle of poison was found nearby, it was not the cause of murder. And when her suicide note turns out to be a fake, Charles, his friend Thomas McConnell, and those around him begin to look out for the truth.

There are a limited number of suspects in the house: George Barnard, the owner and an executive at the Royal Mint; his nephew Claude, who is surely up to no good; his nephew Eustace, a dour young man with definite political ideas; Newton Duff, a prominent politician; Roderick Potts, a tough-to-crack millionaire; and Jack Soames, an executive at the Pacific Trust.

Puller, a chief warrant officer with the Armys Criminal Investigation Division (CID) is the son of the Armys most decorated 3-star general. The father is presently institutionalized with Alzheimers. Puller also has a brother, Robert, who was an Air Force major with a brilliant scientific mind and promising military career who, two years ago, was sentenced to life for the high crime of treason. He was incarcerated in the DB lockup at Ft. Leavenworth. However, Robert Puller miraculously escapes from Leavenworth (first ever) and John Puller is assigned by his boss and several top Pentagon generals the task of tracking brother Robert down and returning him to the DB. To assist him in this task he is assigned a partner, a gorgeous female from the intelligence community, Army Captain Veronica Knox. Puller likes working alone, as does Knox. The joint arrangement results in major personality and procedural conflicts between the two. John Puller is an honest, courageous and trusting person whose values conflict with Knoxs who comes from the shadowy side of the intelligence field where she was taught to lie and deceive to reach her goals. The plot heads in many directions often all at the same time. The story supports a cadre of interesting characters most of whom eventually turn up dead.
 One cannot help but like John Puller, his brilliant investigative techniques, his intuitiveness, his all encompassing honesty and his tenacity in pursuit of justice make him a life-size hero. I believe David Baldacci comes closer to matching the well-researched writings of the late Vince Flynn than any other author of this genre and generation of writers.

Plop the camcorder into its ""pocket"", close the front cover, zip it up and you are ready to go. Nice Carry-Handle -- expands a bit for larger hands. And the shoulder strap is unobtrusive and secure.

The next feature I liked was the impressive hard-shell construction of the front and back of this case. Flat-black, blending well with the black nylon (cordura?) without any flashiness or garish-ness, providing protection against ordinary dings, bangs and even (we hope) a fall or two, without sacrificing the looks of the case. Everything is well-integrated into this case -- looks, protection, streamlining. The case looks like it might even float-- I woudl not try this with a camera inside however. It IS, IMHO water-resistant.

Once the case is hanging on your shoulder it is easy to open it up and retreive your camcorder. My cam is about 6 years old so it really fills up the compartment - however, eveything is snug and easily retrievable.

I would have liked a belt loop, but considering the construction of this case, it probably would have made things unwieldy. So I am not complaining - only suggesting.

2918,"Bees in the Butterfly Garden has a clever title and a cover lovely enough to draw readers in like butterflies to flowers. But the attraction doesn't stop at the title or the cover - this story is unique and engaging! Historical-romance fans will find an enjoyable setting that offers the traditional pull of the descriptions of the high life in late-19th century America. But there's a twist: the hero is a thief, and the heroine - despite her fancy upbringing - wants to be one, too.

No matter what others tell her, Meg simply cannot believe that her father's choice in sending her away to school - and away from him - was one made out of selfless love. She views Ian Maguire as her replacement in her father's life, since her father took Ian in and taught him how to follow in his footsteps. So she determines to prove, if only to herself, that she could be the protege her father desired. Even if that means - or perhaps especially if that means - breaking societal and moral rules.

However, Ian sees Meg as the untainted beauty that her father always portrayed her to be, and he wants to keep her that way, to protect her as her father did. But his resolve begins to crumble under the pressures of greed, reputation, and Meg's charm. Both he and Meg are drawn to the enchantment of a ""garden"" - one that is filled with the colors and promise of their own self-centered dreams. But where is it they really belong?

While certainly a satisfying historical romance, Bees in the Butterfly Garden has even more to offer. It's an exquisite story with wonderful characters that addresses courage, true wealth, and the distinctions between justice, mercy, and grace. A beautiful read from cover to cover!

In typical Melanie Dickerson fashion, this story is sweet, lighthearted, and romantic. It's perfect for teen readers, especially those in the 12-15 age range. It's squeaky clean and addresses an issue that most teens can relate tohaving their voice heard and valued.

This is a Christian novel, and the religious aspects are woven seamlessly throughout the story. If you or your teen like reading clean books with a dash of adventure and a sprinkling of romance, you'll enjoy this book. It's the seventh book in the Haganheim series, but it takes place in England.

Content: Light suspense, non-descriptive violence, and clean kissing scenes (boy/girl).

Her daily struggle, the abstract nightmare of it all, while still retaining an indomitable spirit of hope and will to survive against extreme hardships and almost daily set-backs.  The sparseness of the novel (while decried by some with one star reviews), for me, helped make the stark reality more 'real'.  What beauty what meaning can you find when you are worried about the daily struggles for money, food, and even trying to help watch out for others?
As a child of a war survivor myself, the 'reality' faced with determination and hope is probably the greatest lesson that I have from my mother and grandparents who survived WW II.  The characters in this novel, daily struggling to overcome the harsh realities of their lives and trying to make something better for themselves in the future while managing to bring some hope and care into the lives of a few others in their sphere of influence showed the interdependence and strength of community, friends, and family that can happen even in the direst circumstances.",3,"[-4.539566960289483, -2.514656095967066, -1.2920612769405215, -0.9840653388845964, -1.5335360549347627]",-0.9840653388845964

84,"It is often said that every writer has, at least, one good book in him.  Sadly most of them only have one.  This certainly appears to be the case for Fitzgerald.  The Great Gatsby, while flawed, is nonetheless a great novel.  Gatsby is a tragic figure motivated by a self destructive pursuit of his vision of the American dream.  Dr. Dick Diver, the central character of Tender is the Night, on the other hand, is naught but a dissipated wastrel.  As his wife, who he met while he was working as a psychiatrist & she was interred in an asylum, gains mental stability & some kind of shaky personal wholeness, he descends into drink & carnality & ends the novel roaming from town to town practicing medicine briefly before moving on.  Diver is the kind of insipid navel gazing character who has plagued the Century's fiction.
Tom Wolfe, touring in support of his new novel, has launched himself on a jeremiad against the Modern novel & novelist.  His central point is that novelists need to stop looking inward and look without.  He's saying, Go out into America & tell the wonderful stories that you find there.  There are wonderful stories, waiting to be told, but our greatest novelists are cloistered in Universities, Manhattan apartments, etc., picking at the scabs on their own psyches & the vomiting forth their internal monologues.  Tender is the Night seems to be a victim of this Modernist disease, too autobiographical & self absorbed to tell us much of value about the wider world.

456,"Shirley Jackson is, of course, best remembered for The Lottery , one of the great short stories of all time, and for The Haunting of Hill House, which has twice been made into a movie.  But this terrific novel is every bit as good as those others and may in fact be the best thing she ever wrote.
From what I've read, it seems that Ms Jackson's work may well have been an expression of her own psychological problems.  If that's true, this story is even more frightening.  It is about two sisters, the older one meek and shy, the other assertive and nearly demonic, who barricade themselves inside a gutted mansion to escape the local townsfolk who torment them because they suspect that the girls were involved in the mass killing of four family members.
The psychological overtones are plentiful and troubling.  There is, first of all, the sense in which it appears that it is only when together that the two sisters form one complete personality.  Second, the crime involved is not merely murder, but murder of the family, that ancient taboo.  Third, the two are completely alienated from the society around them, even ignoring the few friendly neighbors who come by to try and help.  Jackson apparently had a horrendous relationship with her mother and with the people of Bennington, where she lived.  Local legend even had it that The Lottery was based on an incident where local boys threw stones at her.  Finally there is a strong indication that not only are the girls happier in their isolation, they may truly be better off by themselves and they may be more ""normal"" than the people in town.
At any rate, the story is creepy and sly and a great deal of fun.  This is one of the truly great gothic horror novels of all time.

And you can easily guess the answer!!! This book was a light, easy to read book, filled with the joy of the season. However, it cannot be without the challenges and problems of the Amish families and community. Life is full of those, regardless of where and how we live and Jerry brings them to life in his Christmas novel.
The main character, Susanna, has married Herman who is strict and firm to his family Amish upbringing. Susanna  is a sweet young lady, who we immediately , to whom we immediately become attached. I felt , many times throughout the story , that I wanted to reach out and give her a hug. She cherishes family traditions of Christmas, as I do, however Herman has no use for the family get togethers that has always been an important part of Susanna's celebration. Must she follow the godly ways of her faith and obey her husband, in spite of her unhappiness?
Meanwhile, who should appear on the scene but an old flame, Matthew. He is an interesting character who is extremely well described. He had left the Amish life to go Englisha, Now, his confessions about his past threaten Susanna and Herman's hope for a successful and happy marriage. Herman begins to question himself and wonders if his love is good enough for his lovely bride. Is he worthy of her ????
  The Christmas season is one in which we all feel the love of God and Jerry expresses this throughout his book.  Will Susanna and Herman settle their differences and make a Christmas wish come true??
The plot of the story is one which is simple but compelling and one which makes one think of the meaning of the season. We are one with the Amish in this book. We all have traditions and wishes , but often must compromise with a spouse to make each other happy.

9366,"I stumbled on to Buffy and Angel rather late.  I started watching the shows in what was the 5th Season for Buffy and the 2nd season of Angel.  Obviously I have seen every episode since both shows were put out on DVD, but I remember becoming an instant fan of both shows, especially Angel, even without all the back-story.  The overall theme of Angel was always the fight against evil, and how it never ends.  The themes on Angel tended to be more mature than those on Buffy, especially as compared to the first three seasons of Buffy.  It did really well in fleshing out his back-story and the transition from Angelus to the good guy he would ultimately become.

The thing I loved that they were able to do on Angel, that was the whole storyline about the redemption of Faith that started in season 1 and carried over to season 4.  The whole story was well written, well acted, and was probably not something that could have ever been done effectively on Buffy.  The show also did well at making all the characters evolve, especially Cordelia and Wesley.  At least not as effectively as it was on Angel.  The last season seems to be one that many fans either liked or hated.  I loved the last season.  The whole story of trying to fight evil from inside the belly of the beast was done well.  And it had some of the best episodes of the series, including Hellbound, Smile Time, A Hole in The World, and Shells.

The ending to the series was rushed, mainly because the network cancelled the show pretty much at the last minute.  They actually had to go back and re-shoot some of the scenes for the last show after they knew it was going to be a series finale rather than the season finale. While not quite a Sapranos fade abrupt black screen, the series is not wrapped up in a nice tidy bow.  It cuts off at the start of an epic battle, the conclusion to which we never know (unless you get the season 6 comic books).

Chances are if you are reading this you already know at least a little bit about the series.  While liking or disliking a TV show involves a large amount of subjectivity, what I can tell you is that if you have seen some of the shows and liked those, the series on the whole is consistently good with not many bad or ""clunker"" episodes among the 110 episodes.",2,"[-1.4979072141155951, -1.7364632964147013, -0.9853534573494737, -1.0213372719685045, -1.2625459761309332]",-0.9853534573494737

Ben was awfully quick to believe what Tracy said about Renee, so his hero crown got a little tarnished for me.
Janice is a great friend to Renee, but when Renee was wallowing after the outcome of the show (we all need to wallow after a big setback, especially in the romance department, Janice tells her she needs to take a shower. If one of my friends ever said that to me when I was down, I'd be really mad.

I enjoyed the story. There are definite sparks from the beginning and they ignite as the story continues. The book is well-written with developed characters and a real foundation for their relationship is established.  This is the beginning of the story and it will continue.

1628,"Doctor Jerome Groopman, through his own experiences with illness (a back injury and four different diagnoses for a hand condition) and those of fellow doctors and patients, has learned a lot about how doctors think. The care a given patient receives is dependent on many things, among them: does the doctor LIKE them, BELIEVE them, and actually WANT to help them. He also tells of the thought processes they go through when attempting to diagnose conditions, based on what they have been taught, many having learned, ""when you hear hoof beats, think of horses, not zebras;"" about thinking outside the box once a diagnosis has been passed on to them (confirmation bias, diagnosis momentum); and thinking of potential diagnoses in the face of conflicting test results. This is a great book for anyone who has ever been misdiagnosed, received conflicting diagnoses, been given psych meds because their doctor thinks they are suffering from a ""functional"" (psychosomatic) illness, and pretty much everyone else who has ever seen a doctor. He delves into the mental aspects of being an MD: their sometimes quest to be ""fast and frugal"" plays a part in their decisions about choosing appropriate tests, sending patients to specialists and recommending a given treatment. As with a case presented at the start of the book about a long-suffering woman with a treatable medical condition whose incorrect diagnosis was passed from doctor to doctor and whose statements were disbelieved, How Doctors Think shows how ideal doctors can wade through the muck of the medical world and make wise decisions regarding patients and their care.

The storyline is interesting, and it's nice to see how the two main characters are able to integrate their personal and professional lives.

With help she escapes and ends up in the small town of Monroe, Colorado in the Rocky Mountains and changes her name to Sarah. She is immediately intrigued by one of the local police officers but her brother and supposed fiance have not quit looking for her.

I enjoy this series by author Katie Ruggle but I like her other SEARCH AND RESCUE series better. The characters were a bit more fleshed out and the storylines more plausible. I also got more of a sense of the Colorado setting in the S&R series.

You are supposed to read a page a day, but it was so interesting that I kept reading until I finished the whole book. But that's okay, because now I plan on going back and reading one page a day and do any exercises he advises you to do. Example: write down your dreams and see what you can do to head in the direction of that dream. All you need is a notebook to go with this book. I found the inspiring words by famous people at the top of each page really nice and they will make you stop and think.

He also gives great examples and you will find yourself comparing it to yourself or to people you know. Like those who sit around talking and planning constantly but never going into action or accomplishing anything. You don't have to have great ambitions to enjoy this book because even if you want to accomplish small things, it will help you get started. Small starts sometimes produce great results though so who knows what will happen then.

I wondered if I would find my biggest fault in there somewhere and I did. I am a loner but seem to collect people. If I walk down the road, I come home with all the dogs in the neighborhood following me. I didn't object to the dogs, but then people started following also, wanting to be friends, taking up my time, etc. Well, the author says I need to ""get over myself"". OK, ok. I'll try to be friendlier and stop hiding. (I didn't realize I had so many faults until I started reading this book.) But don't worry, he has great suggestions for making you ""get over yourself"".

However, this author is great at setting the hook early and you HAVE to read and read and read to finish the story and resolve the mysteries encased in mysteries that distinguish Carr's books in the field. Part of what draws you through the book, though, is its relevance to today's news stories and with the public's growing interest in forensic science as well as law enforcement's reliance on that methodology. Carr espouses the cause of psychological profiling that was valid in the 19th century and remains an important piece of investigative crime solving. With the same great writing and reasoned approach that made The Alienist a huge bestseller, Carr definitely has another masterpiece for you to enjoy! This was a perfect book to enjoy in the quiet moments, and I did so! But, before I conclude, i have to speak to the protagonists. This crime-solving team is personable and fun.

Taylor's life isn't hers. Taylor has no control over it because of her parents and older brother. They tell her what to do, how to do it, how to live etc. But she's always rebelled against their wishes and when she crossed their line, she was shipped off to her aunt in Florida. But she returned and pretended to be the perfect daughter her parents had wanted her to be and, unfortunately, that included giving up on her crush, on the person she loved, James 'Clutch' Mason.

Clutch always pushed Taylor away, saying she was much too young to be crushing on him. He'd always had feelings for her though and when he saw her again, his hard exterior cracked and he did something that changed everything and made Taylor re-evaluate her life and how she was living it.

I loved Clutch, I loved Taylor. I also liked the friendship between Clutch, Nix, Dray and Rett. Oh and the girls too. Better said, I liked the entire gang. I very much liked the relationship between Clutch and his baby brother, Rett.

I can honestly say I loved this book and I'm going to re-read it. Funny, the right amount of drama, slightly frustrating at times but there are a few hot scenes to make up for it. 4 1/2 stars.

All you need to is to set the time by aligning a 'TIME NOW' arrow with the time marks on the outside dial. It's done in half-hour increments. On the very outer edge of the dial there are 48 easy to pull pins, one for each half hour interval and the setup is simple: power is off when the pin is up, power is on when the pin is down.

For Anya Von Bremzen food is more about the life of a country as well as the life of a family.  The book looks at life in the Soviet Union from the last days of the Czars until the present through the food her grandparents, parents and her family ate as well as the food the people ate.

Despite limits on what was available the author talks about the creativity her mother used as a young girl to make good tasting meals. She also talks about her interest in cooking and how she learned to get creative with little. In many ways the history of the Soviet Union and any country can be told by the food available.

This is more than a tale about food. It is about her mother's life during  World War II. It talks about and waiting on line for food and crowded living conditions. It talks about hope despite harsh living conditions and  the love of a family despite those living conditions.

The book also includes one recipe for each decade starting in 1910 and ending in the twenty first century. Each recipe symbolizes what was happening in the Soviet Union at the time.

This is a heartwarming  book to read despite the breath of history examined and the often difficult circumstances faced by the  people of the Soviet Union. It also  examines the importance food plays in our memories since it is often a reflection of our families station in life and a countries political and economic situation.",3,"[-3.297897378071008, -2.135797052359207, -1.1782073549933478, -0.9877442655158654, -1.2695572740447818]",-0.9877442655158654

As has been stated in other reviews, the hero of this tale is exactly that: a hero.  There is absolutely no depth to this character, or any other in this book.  'Beck' has some sort of super spy background that seems to give him access to things about which mere mortals can only dream.  For some reason though, his reputation isn't stellar enough for anybody to believe him when he suspects some sort of sabotage plot involving a local nuclear plant.  What's a super hero to do?  Why, single handedly take down the bad guys with just the barest means of support.  Lucky for us, Beck is able to call in favors on a moment's notice and get not one, but two, Apache attack helicopters to help save the day.
Give me a break.

The other one dimensional characters include Beck's wife and daughter, who are as picture perfect as he is.  Everybody else is pretty much a cynical half wit or a terrorist...just waiting to be 'schooled' by Beck.

There are pages and pages of tiresome details related to potassium, a B24 airplane, nuclear power plant specifics, etc.  It's like the author wants to be Tom Clancy, but actually writes more like Caroline Keene of Nancy Drew fame.
Although the writing itself is not terrible, the juxtaposition of a potential nuclear disaster and cheesy repartee the hero shares with the other characters (mainly his wife) simply does not work.

Grant McAllister arrives in Murphy, North Carolina, with one aim: to sell his inherited property and leave as quickly as possible. The big-city lawyer has no interest in his late, estranged grandparents or the dilapidated mansion he just acquired. After his high-profile divorce, he should be avoiding perky reporters, too. But Jami Carlisle is honest, funny, and undeniably appealing.

After breaking up with her safe-but-smothering boyfriend, Jami is determined to ace her first big assignment. A story about the McAllister estate is too intriguing to ignoremuch like its handsome, commitment-phobic heir. Thanks to her digging, the pieces of Grants fraught family history are gradually fitting into place, but also upending all his old beliefs.

The two draw closer as they share their dreams, until misread signals and misunderstandings begin to test their trust. But in the unspoiled beauty of the Smoky Mountains, theres healing and forgiveness to be found. And for Grant, this unplanned detour may be just whats needed to finally guide him home

My Review:

 Grant thinks he has it all figured out. He wants to shed some property that he has inherited. He has just endured a very high profile divorce so the last think he wants to do is draw attention to himself. But when he meats the beautiful Jami Carlisle he thinks about maybe retracting his former stance on the attention.

 Jami just knows there is a story with this Grant McAllister guy and she is bound and determined to get the story. She finds his behavior a little odd but she has to proceed none the less.

Soon the two of them sort through their fears, misgivings, and misunderstandings to discover that they like each others company more than they ever anticipated. But these two are a sight to be seen. The two of them will have to work past a lot but I really believe they could make it work if they just commit to the hard stuff.

 I have never read any of Carol J. Post's books but this one, Trust My Heart sure was something that peaked my interest and makes me want to read more. A story that was full of romance and drama is a great book for a lazy Sunday!

139,"In this new novel, Marian Keyes has made a slight divergence from her usual style:  instead of one female main character, there are three, and at first, their stories seem completely unrelated.  The book opens with Gemma, a young event planner whose life turns upside down when her father suddenly announces that he is having an affair.  Gemma struggles to cope with her hysterical mother while still nursing her own broken heart:  two years before, her boyfriend, Anton, began dating her best friend, Lily.  Just as the reader has become thoroughly engrossed in Gemma's life (about 75 pages into the book), the story abruptly shifts to JoJo, an up-and-coming literary agent.  JoJo is a beautiful, strong woman who leads an ideal life, with one exception:  she is having an affair with her married boss.  JoJo's tale leads us finally to one of her clients, Lily, Gemma's former friend.  Although Lily is still happily partnered with Anton and is the proud mother of young Ema, she is also consumed by guilt about Gemma.  When a little novel she wrote becomes a best seller, Lily lives life as if in a dream, certain that the happiness she has found will not last.
Initially, I didn't enjoy reading the book from three different perspectives:  I was dismayed to leave Gemma behind in the midst of her crisis, especially given that it was unclear how her path and JoJo's would intersect.  In addition, I found it a little odd that both Gemma's and JoJo's stories were narrated in the third person while Lily spoke in the first person, and I'm still uncertain about the significance of this literary device.  As the book continued, however, I began to enjoy the shifts amongst the three women, especially when the connections between them became more apparent.  Although some parts of the story dragged a bit, towards the end of the novel, Keyes picks up the pace, and the more frequent changes in viewpoint make for an exciting finish.

The main subject matter in this novel, did not, in fact, involve a lot about butterflies as we think of those pretty flowers with wings, or flower gardens, though these subjects were in the background of this novel.

It is definitely a novel or unique plot, and I enjoyed the twists and turns as well as the superb word paintings. While reading this, and also as I think about the novel now, I am more appreciative of the heritage my parents handed down to me.

When the woman he loved walked out of his life, Brooks Alexander was certain she did so willinglywith the cool two-million his father had offered as incentive to walk away. So when he learns that Darcy didn't take a dime of his fathers payoff, Brooks realizes he made an epic mistake. Hes determined to make things right and reclaim his woman. Except neither task is as easily accomplished as he first thought.

Now her life is in his hands

Wedding planner Darcy is no stranger to disappointment when it comes to the men in her life. When Brooks accused her of taking his fathers bribe, she was devastated that he thought so little of herand realized he never knew her at all. So she walked away with her pride intact and her heart broken. Now, months later, an overheard conversation puts Darcy in the crosshairs of a dangerous criminal with powerful connections. With nowhere else to turn, she has no choice but to put all her trust in Redemption Harbor Consultingand its cofounder, the man who broke her heart.

Review:

Okay, so Brooks is a dumb*** at the beginning of this book, but quickly redeems himself.

Like the other books in the series is about the friends who run Redemption Harbor Consulting.  This time it is Brooks story, as he tries to win back Darcy and keep her safe.  The resulting story was action packed and super sexy.  Darcy and Brooks do make a great couple, he is a stand-up guy and she does not take any of his crap.  This is the third book in the series, but each can be read as a stand-alone, though I would recommend reading them all.

Looking for a good romantic suspense, then give this a try.

1948,"I have never read any other books or articles or seen any television shows by Shawn Achor before reading this book. His ideas make a lot of sense to me but I almost feel like I need a seminar to take what I have read and really make it work in my life.  This is not a simple self-help book full of positive ideas on how to be happy, but rather an, at times, almost technical look at how happiness happens.

The author uses a five step approach to get a person to the point where they can experience happiness. For me the steps are as follows:

1. Have a willingness to look at things differently to open up more paths to being happy;
2. Define what matters most in life and what will bring you happiness and then have a plan to make these goals happen;
3. Find ways of moving more quickly to these goals;
4. Don't allow other happenings interfere with reaching these goals; and,
5. Help others around you see the importance of your goals so you are not experiencing them in a vacuum.

The author uses personal experiences and psychological studies to explain his views on happiness. His logic is sound and even the technical aspects of what he was saying was understandable.

I do think I was at a slight disadvantage having never read or seen anything by the author. I will  watch his show on PBS and will read more of what he has written.

I am glad I read this book and will attempt to use what I have learned in my life.

As Lil, an elderly woman, prepares as small Manhattan bookstore for its opening every morning, she reflects on her life and the secret she hides from the world. Only at night is Lil free from subterfuge, releasing her feathery wings in the privacy of her apartment. For Lil is a fairy godmother, the very one charged with transforming Cinderella into the stunning beauty in glass slippers who captures the heart of her handsome prince. Unable to deliver an anxious Cinderella that fateful night, and in love with the prince herself, the fairy godmother attends the ball in Cinderella's stead, knowing human love for one magical evening.

Now Lil is doomed to remain human, hiding her shame along with her true identity. As much as she yearns to return to the fairy world of her childhood, she cannot until her disastrous decision has been made right. Opportunity arrives in the form of her handsome young boss, George, who needs a date for an upcoming society ball. Having just met the dynamic Veronica, who adores retro chic and romance, Lil believes the time has come to rectify a terrible mistake. In vivid scenes, Turgeon's failed godmother recreates her past, a teary Cinderella unable to accept the prince's unconditional love, a fairy conflicted with forbidden desire. But the present intrudes- hinting at troublesome truths- in the form of a persistent new landlord banging on the apartment door with legal papers and an envelope of old photographs he has found. On the street, a stranger approaches an astonished Lil, claiming to recognize her, but Lil has no idea what the woman is talking about.

In simple prose, the author blends the possible with the impossible, willing her readers to suspend belief and enter Lil's magical world. Will the success of the present restore the damage of the past? Will Lil ever be able to return to her fairy home? Or will the world assert itself, forcing us to relinquish a fairy tale for the voice of reason?  Truth is in the eyes of the beholder.

6700,"This has become one of my new favorite series. I really enjoy the great mix of romance and action. The demon siblings and the Faieara siblings seem to be finding their mates just in time to rescue Faierara from the invaders. I highly recommend you read them all in order.

In this third book in the series. Cale is sent to find Kyra. It was amusing to hear his impressions of Earth and see him adapt. After living there for so many centuries, Kyra really has embraced the culture. She labels Cale as a player pretty quickly and he uses the urban dictionary to figure out what she means.

Cale in the first book seemed very much a player. He was arrogant and using women as a sexual release. He had been betrayed by his mother and mate and it really changed him. He only cared for his brother and sister and their good friends.

Kyra really challenges him. She doesn't accept being treated like the other women. She has had to adapt and hide for centuries and it has not been easy. Kyra has a good friend, Zoe, who she has gotten very close to. Kyra tried not to get to attached to others but Zoe is someone she really cares about and wants to protect.

Cale and Kyra really struggle to find a balance. They are tied together by their mission and family and the attraction and connection between them is really strong. He already has a mate and demons can only have one mate. It is hard for both of them. His jealousy is kind of cute.

This book has a lot of action both on Earth and on their mission to reclaim her planet.  There is an introduction of some new characters including a really cute dragon shifter. I liked seeing them all working together and the sisters really learn how to master their magic. There are some surprises I won't reveal but one of them made me very happy.

I am looking forward to the next book that gives more of a look at the relationship between Sonya and Ethan.  They get their own book rather than just being a sub-plot in the last two books.

The vampires like experience and adventuresome courtesans  as shrinking violets don't taste good.  Being a virgin will have to remain her secret  but being a vampire virgin raises her price  no neck scarring and fresh meat.

An immediate change of clothes, makeup and hair  and she is whisked off to her audition with Kristos.  Their dinner turns into a gun battle, resulting in all escaping with only minor injuries.  But as she is cared for back at Kristos home she is alternately pampered or treated as the flavor of the week.  Myra ultimately admits her virgin status to Kristos who rather than being disappointed, is pleased.  Kristos takes her virginity in a very erotic passage, and when he also feeds from her a surprise from Myras past is revealed.  This past indicates it is Myra who was the target of the shooter  not Kristos.

Amazing characters with a unique take on vampires.  A fast-paced, full of surprises story, which will keep you on the edge of your seat and pulse soaring!!

Savage Hawke owns a gentlemens club. He is handsome and cocky. He appears to be an Alpha male, but that is where I was mistaken in my assumption. I expected him to be the sure of himself man that other books portray. The man with a past, but sleeping his way out of it. That is definitely not Savage.

Danika Eriksson is beautiful, assertive, and has a mouth on her that gets her in trouble more often than not. She is not one to hold back when she feels she has something to say and this is one thing that attracts Savage.

Their relationship is unconventional and explosive. But hes hiding something that hes been able to keep from her due to his luck. But he knows he needs to tell her if they're going to move forward. When his secret is revealed, things are somewhat tense. I loved Dani and Savage together. They were an interesting couple.

4462,"This is the first book I read by this author, but I can say it won't be the last. Skyler and Kips story is one of love and understanding. This is not one where you have two broken characters trying to put each other back together. It is a story of two young people looking to find themselves and making their dreams come true.

I am not familiar with the game of poker. I had no idea what was going on during the matches because I don't follow or understand the game, yet I found it extremely interesting through the authors descriptions. The way she makes the reader picture the facial expressions (or lack of) while Skyler plays, kept me intrigued.

Skyler and Kip meet in amusing circumstances and the relationship that forms between them is very strong. They are undoubtedly perfect for each other, but have to fight those outside forces conspiring to keep them apart. Both are hiding something that will definitely put a huge damper on their relationship, yet the way they handle the situation when the issues are revealed is quite special.

Kip is beyond HOT and definitely someone every girl would be proud to call hers. He is funny, smart, and devoted to the one hes with. Skyler is outgoing and a spitfire. She is funny and loyal. Their romance takes you on a rollercoaster, full of ups and downs. There were times when I wanted to smack Skyler, feeling like her actions were childish, but then remembering shes just in college, I could understand. It also proves how invested I was in the characters when all their actions felt so real.

The authors writing is amazing. She gives us fantastic characters and a very intriguing plot. Love, heartache, and friendship are strong in this book. The connections between the sororities and fraternities is not something Im familiar with, yet the way they are described certainly makes them understandable. The way sisters and brothers care and look out for each other is nice to see, yet like with everything, it is realistic to see that rivalries are always possible.

There seems to be plenty to write about Skyler and Kips friends. Maybe this isn't the end? (hint, hint Kandi ;-) )",3,"[-4.2348939331924615, -2.2697887133793726, -1.1708361374110638, -0.9899662215038354, -1.0522904925138472]",-0.9899662215038354

1154,"In Carl Hiaasen's early days of writing fiction, he partnered with Bill Montalbano to write three gritty crime novels.  The second, Trap Line, exposes the underbelly of life in Key West, where fishermen and drug runners take to the seas to make a living.  When Breeze Albury refuses to help some smugglers, they get their revenge by cutting his trap lines, ruining his business.  Trying to make up his losses, he ends up in league with local criminals, who lead him into a different sort of trap.  Running from the corrupt local law enforcement and hiding out from the criminal gangs, he plots his devious revenge.

Trap Line is a shadow of the more entertaining series of books he writes later on.  As in most of Hiaasen's books, everyday folks get mixed up with bumbling criminals, but Trap Line lacks most of the humor and absurdity of his later fiction.  Ultimately that means this is quite a bit less enjoyable.  There are no heroes here, only varying degrees of badness getting revenge on badness.

All that said, Hiaasen's colorful characterizations and sense of Florida culture, along with the interconnected plot lines, set him apart from typical crime writers.  Hiaasen fans might want to pick up Trap Line for some historical perspective on his work, but it will make them long for Skink and the fun of Hiaasen's later fiction.",3,"[-2.760234011715762, -1.443628692983379, -1.144876425830929, -0.9903904265695394, -1.3539344109106568]",-0.9903904265695394

She's in love with her best friend's big brother - one of them, there are a few - who also happens to be her big brother's best friend. Long story short, he's considered too old for her but when he leaves to join the Army, he shows that he has feelings for her.

He comes back, changed. Of course. It's war, it's bloody, it's traumatizing and scarring, both on the outside and on the inside. Mental scars are the hardest to bear. Here's where the hiccup is. One of them, at least. The heroine is pretty selfish. She's all about me, me, me, when everyone around her tells her Jake is changed and she should know that too, since he stops communicating with her while away, in a war zone. Does she listen? Not really. She's still me, me, me. Oh and how she constantly thinks of Jake and mentions it in every situation is eye-rolling.

He's left with one reminder of that crash, the selective amnesia that has left him with a memory gap of the four weeks prior to the accident.  So it isn't any surprise when he doesn't recognize the dark haired beauty who comes up to him at a party and then punches him in the face.

Bryony Morgan fell for Rafael hook, line and sinker when he came to Moon Island trying to buy the parcel of land she was selling.  She believed him when he said he would be back to the island after taking care of business in New York, but was soon devastated when he never returned.  When she ended up pregnant, she decides to go to New York to confront Rafael.  The last thing she expected was for him to not recognize her.

This is a story of second chances and using that second chance to become a better person.

Rafael discovers he was a different person in the weeks he spent Bryony.  And while he's almost certain he never acted as she says, once he gets to Moon Island with her, he discovers that he likes the person that he is with her.  He also discovers that after just a few days, he loves her and wants to have a family with her, even if he can't remember any of their time together.

Bryony second chance (or with Rafe, maybe it's more like third chance) is to grab hold and fight for what she loves.  She let Rafe go once without a fight, but when he leaves for New York again she decides that she needs to fight for their chance to be together and not get hung up on promises made that he obviously can't remember.  When she's once again devastated by Rafe, she grabs hold of the love he displays to her and doesn't let go.

8981,"It is really hard to rate this book, because there are things that I loved and things that I didn't care for as a reader, but overall it is a solid book, entertaining and riddled with drama.

The characters created mixed feelings for me.  Bristol is likable.  An interior designer and successful in her career, Bristol is kind and supportive, but she also stands her ground and protects her heart.  There isn't much past this that we know about her, other than her family relationship. This allows readers to like her, but I wasn't invested in her. The character, though that created the most tumultuous feelings is Jax.  When the novel started I hated him.  He is brash and arrogant, but it rang false to me.  It seemed to be a mask for his insecurities versus being part of who he is.  Jax, however did grow on me.  His change as a result of his interactions with Bristol seemed authentic.  This is the Jax he should have been through the whole novel.  I love this Jax.  He is sweet and considerate, and every single time he uses the word love as a term of endearment had me swooning. Even with mixed feelings for the characters, I enjoyed the two as a couple.  It is obvious they care for each other, their development as a couple in light of the details of the story is authentic, and watching them come together is enjoyable.

The plot for me is what I enjoyed most about this story.  It is filled with drama, which I love! What I love most though about the story is that what the reader thinks is going to be the obvious conflict and resolution isnt.  There is a much more intense and suspense filled conflict, and I enjoyed every single moment of this ride!!  Lovers of drama-filled romances will love this story from being to end.

This has been my first story by LP Dover, and while I didn't love it, I enjoyed the book overall. It provided me with sweet romance, some suspense, and escape from the world. I will certainly check out more books from the series.

9327,"Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""Invasion U. S. A."" starring Chuck Norris. I found it at Wal-Mart on the five-dollar rack. Well, what can I say? It's another of those totally improbable, wildly imaginative, overly violent Chuck Norris action sagas. I don't really know why I watch these things, except that they're fun. The violence, the gunfire, the killings, the explosions and the destruction are so rampant that it actually becomes funny. It's a bizarre form of humor, I suppose. Sick, perhaps, but still funny.

Well, in the Invasion U. S. A. saga, the Florida Coast is invaded by a fleet of amphibious vehicles carrying hundreds of highly armed and highly organized terrorists. They sweep out onto land and are quickly and efficiently dispersed into Miami where they start blowing up homes, breaking up parties and killing innocent people. In some places they are disguised as police officers or the National Guard forces, creating confusion among the populace. The leader of the invasion is a sometime Soviet agent named Rostov (Richard Lynch), who is one bad dude. Matt Hunter (Chuck Norris) is a former CIA agent who is convinced to come out of retirement in order to dispatch this really bad and pesky dude. It's the old western movie all over again. There's the Black Hats (Rostov and the invading force) who are about as bad as bad can get and are out to inflict widespread damage in order to get their way. Then there's the White Hats led by Hunter. Well, just like any western movie, the White Hats ultimately beat the Black Hats, except that the gunfight between the two factions is much more elaborate and violent. And just like in any old western movie, the final battle is between the #1 White Hat and #1 Black Hat. Who wins? Well, take a guess.

Okay, the whole plot is absurd and an exercise in stupidity. But that doesn't mean it's not fun to watch. It is fun to watch. I consider it to be a very violent action comedy and, as such, it's rather well done. The acting is so-so. The production and stunts are quite good. It's well paced so you don't have to think about the ridiculous plot that you're following. It's good entertainment for the buck.

Like Lori Roys Bent Road that I reviewed back in 2012 this is a book about family relationships and struggles.  I am walking a fine line here not wanting to give too much away. Back in the 30s the familys crop was tobacco, in the 50s it is lavender. (Isnt the cover beautiful.) Life has never been easy for this family, some people say they are cursed. The Baines and the Cowleys have a history and when Annie ventures on Baine land the past comes back and eerie things are brought to light.

Roy has written quite a story and creating some flawed and fascinating characters. A few characters in both time periods are believed to have the know-how or the ability to know something is about to happen. This is a very dark read and full of tragedy. The author tells the story and she doesnt pull any punches. Her style is very descriptive. There are a few twists and I started to see where the story could end up but I was only partly right.

But Man Candy had a clever way to capture my attention and prove it is more than just man candy. It is also a uniquely heartwarming, charming, and gratifying love story. I fell for Quinn, a sexy male model, right from the start. He is cocky, playful, and romantic, but also thoughtful, and caring. He has moved back home to establish a more meaningful life for himself. He has been friends with Jaime since they were kids, and has wanted her just as long. She had a crush on him back then as well, but he never felt worthy of her until now. He is finally ready to make his move on Jaime but she is not being cooperative. Jaime is smart and sassy but also temperamental and closed off to relationships and love. It took me awhile to warm up to Jaime until I realized that is how the men are usually described in these stories. I love a strong female character and that is just what Jaime is, without the public displays of affection. That realization made Jaime relateable to me, and that is when I fell for her as well. Quinn caught on to her fears right away and loved the challenge of convincing her to believe in love. He loved the contradiction of Jaime being fire in the bedroom and then ice away from it. She was also funny, quirky, and couldn't back down from a dare. She would get into situations that had me laughing so hard I had tears in my eyes. I loved how their relationship developed. It was challenging, playful and so passionate with chemistry that is off the charts! Jaimes' brother and girlfriends are essential to the story as well making it even more engaging and well rounded.

He meets Becca on an assignment and they have a wild weekend together - then he is gone. Becca is left pregnant and later a single mother. Zach can't reveal himself because he cannot compromise his job, but he watches over her and his son Parker via a camera feed. Becca thinks he was a Marine. Zach had arranged for her to be notified of his death in order for her to be able to draw a pension that he arranged for her - his way of supporting them without being in their life. When Parker is six years old, Zach is drawn out of hiding to save them from an assassin that has moved in with Becca and Parker as their nanny.  Since Becca knows that he's not dead, he is free to sneak in and out of their lives when his situation allows. This leads to some VERY steamy stolen moments that involve a lot of spanking, anal play and ""domestic  dominance"" - so read the book description and take heed. If this is not your thing, proceed with caution. I am not a fan, but read it with an open mind - realizing that this is a popular theme that many people enjoy. I do think the asthma aspect of the story gave it a little something different, which I liked.

542,"I found this book much more engaging than McCullough's bio of John Adams.  Of the founding fathers' bios that I have read, Hamilton may be the one I would most like to have spent a long dinner listening to his ideas and political concerns.  Part of his quality is his underdog status.  A poor immigrant who was probably the only founding father to personify the American hope of rags-to-riches.

As with almost all the other founding fathers, whose biographies I have read, Thomas Jefferson played a significant role.  As with some of these founding fathers, Jefferson played a villainous role.  I am still trying to find enough reason to glorify Jefferson, but the guy needed a good kick in the rear.

Chernow provides excellent refutation of the Jeffersonian inspired negative images of Hamilton as an enemy of democracy and an aristocrat.  In a manner that would have made Hamilton proud, the author seems to take pleasure in noting the hypocrisy of the aristocratic Jefferson, and Madison attacking Hamilton who actually put his life on the line to win independence from Britain, and who may have been the first to have called for the Constitutional Convention to make this land into an actual country.  If the British ever saw Jefferson, it was only to glimpse the back of his horse as he fled to the hills at the first sight of a redcoat.

Less happy for Hamilton is the author's honest assessment of Hamilton's weaknesses, of which there were many.  This is why any current day opponents of Hamilton (e.g., state rights exponents) would have to agree that this is a well-balanced treatment of its subject.  After finishing this book, I concluded that Hamilton would have been the brightest, and hardest working president in history, but his temperament would have surely doomed his administration.

968,"Dan Chaon presents a novel about two separate sets of murders: the first taking place 30 years prior to the book's beginning and the other set in present day.  By itself these separate murders would be sufficient to underscore a fascinating novel about the circumstances of the crimes.  Dustin Tillman is a psychologist practicing in suburban Cleveland and with a saying he relates to his patients; ""We are always telling stories to ourselves about ourselves""  Thirty years ago his parents and his aunt and uncle were murdered.  Dustin's adoptive brother Rusty was tried for the crime and sentenced to life in prison.  The murders coincided with a period of Satanic worship and in spite of a lack of evidence Rusty was remanded to prison.
  Dustin receives the notice  that after 30 years Rusty has been freed due to evidence found via DNA testing.  His testimony helped to send Rusty to prison and his worry is - will he come after me for revenge.  At the same time a patient becomes friends with Dustin and begins telling him the details of a series of murders aimed at young men.  They are captured and after their murder are dumped into a river to be found later.  The patient points out that apparently the dates of the killings are related and predicts the date for the next crime.
  Mr Chaon tells his story by going into his characters and relating their thought processes and reactions to what is happening.  The thoughts are distorted by what is being viewed and experienced as is normal in life. This type of approach makes the novel a study in interpretation by people involved in the events. The reader's point of view changes with the events portrayed and does not necessarily depict what is actually happening. It is quite a departure from murder mysteries that go from the crime, through the premise and the logical solution allowing the reader to ""solve"" the case, usually before the end.
  You are going to either enjoy this approach or get turned off by the apparent meandering going on.  I found it a very interesting method and would really like Mr Chaon to try this again.",3,"[-4.0373170261394336, -2.7879862264524595, -1.3507340863183712, -0.9922161281579531, -1.2753183620862294]",-0.9922161281579531
2625,"The unconventional love story between Noah Tate and Olivia Cane continues in Hitched: Volume Two, the second installment in the Improper Love series from bestselling author Kendall Ryan. Things pick up soon after where the first book left off. Olivia disappeared right before the wedding that would have fulfilled one part of what was required both her and Noah to gain ownership of Tate & Cane, the business their fathers started. Noah can only speculate what led to Olivia running off, but when she finally confesses the truth behind her runaway bride fiasco, Noahs protectiveness takes over. Olivia cant help but appreciate Noahs support and help, and she begins to see him in a new light. Can these two adversaries finally find more common ground and forge an actual friendship? However, Noah wants to be more than friends, but will he be able to convince Olivia that nothing about his feelings for her are fake?

I was surprised by how quickly the issue Olivia was facing was resolved and how the story was focused more on the relationship between Olivia and Noah. I did find myself frustrated with Olivia because of how she would be gushing with appreciation over Noahs help with her initial situation one minute and then treat him like a horny leper the next. I felt for the guy, especially since it was clear that he was being sincere and that he was trying his best to show her that he was more than the playboy she pegged him out to be. Clearly my sympathies were for Noah while I was reading this second volume, though I do admit to wishing he would have brought up the whole second stipulation in the agreement their fathers came up with. But hey, after the cliffhanger ending here, I cant wait to see what lengths Noah will go to in order to rectify his blunder and finally claim his wife for real. So far, so good.

Evie feels drawn to Abel Adams, her neighbors nephew. He has lost his parents and come to stay with his uncle. Abel is surrounded by mystery and scandal. His parents weren't meant to be together, he wasn't meant to be at all.
But Evie sees through the veil of monstrosity that has been thrown over an innocent boy. She sees to the heart of him.

She transcribes the crimes that men have committed and it is up to her to get their confessions and transgressions correct.  In the age of gangsters, bathtub gin, and the Charleston, life is sure to change for Ms. Baker with she walks in, the other typist, Odalie.
Set in the age of Prohibition, in the jazzy 1920s Manhattan, Suzanne Rindell's  debut novel is gripping narrative sure to draw the reader in from the first page. Rose is prudish and proper, prim and judgmental.  But when she becomes entranced by Odalie, the vivacious and flirtatious newest staff member at the precinct, she is thrown into a life she never thought she would experience.  Everyone vies for Odalie's attention and Rose is no different.
Rose and the Other Typist become fast friends and are whirled into a life of beaded dresses, bobbed haircuts, and speakeasies hidden behind wig shops.  Perfect for anyone who loved the Great Gatsby and yearns for a time gone by, this deliciously descriptive story is realistic and oddly enough, easy to relate to.
The chronicle, told at times in hindsight, is given in a great more detail and offers insight otherwise unknown, while keeping the readers' interest continually piqued.  The occasional mention of a doctor is slightly confusing but keeps the reader racing through the pages, continually wondering with could have possibly happened to plain ol' Rose.  The dynamic character development is anything but clich.  Delivered in a truly honest voice of a woman with a keen eye, the narrative proves to be immensely detailed and observant.

David is ready to ask Leigh to marry him, but embarrassed about the small size of his mother's diamond. Leigh wasn't worrying over a diamond. She was more concerned about David's feelings about being older than she. Other challenges are about to veil the size of the diamond. Shadows from the past and a newcomer to town become the clouds of the future.

This is the third book in a series set back in the 1960s in a small town called Hollyhill. The Brooke family is the focus of these stories, and the activities in small town America are typical of the time period. Prejudices still remain and gossip is a common activity. The setting is quaint and the characters are varied and colorful. The development of the characters throughout this series and in this concluding book is commendable. Ann Gabhart has a wonderful talent for creating a great cast of characters and making the reader a part of Hollyhill and sharing all of the activities therein.

If you're looking for an engaging, satisfying and unpredictable story of family and love, mystery and intrigue, wit and comedic events, Summer of Joy will satisfy your quest. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and felt very much a part of the story as I traveled back in time to my own high school years along with Jocie. Grab a copy of this book and relax with a pot of tea.

No fast-forwarding and if anything may have seemed like it was skipped over, Jameson and Ashton were forced to confront it later down the line. There's humor and there's angst, but neither one of them feels out of place in this story, both coming in at separate yet appropriate points in the book. There are tell-tale signs of just how great a friendship these two once shared when they allowed themselves to be comfortable in each other's presence, and those made for some of my favorite parts of their tale. My heart broke for them as individuals but it also hoped that they would ultimately find their way as a meant-to-be couple.

Dr Lee gives an overview of American history and what lead to the formation of our government and explains some of our laws as they were intended by the authors. A vast number of Americans are upset with the ""change"" we received from the last Presidential election. I don't think many realized how that change would infringe upon our lives.

Dr Lee describes what he sees as a mandate for change, back to what our country was supposed to be about in the first place. There is a lot of history and a lot of current facts which are used to support this view.

This book is deep, yet it all makes sense. I think it's interesting that he even uses examples from Lenin and Marx to support his views. He sites battles over the definition of family and marriage, the health care dilemma, problems in our schools and the basic dignity of human life as the major areas where a growing number of Americans want change. Or at least to get rid of the change we just had forced upon us.

If I recall correctly, in the movie Field of Dreams, the audience does not know until the end that the phrase ""if you build it, he will come"" refers to Ray's father. In the book it is clear very early(page 19 he tells Joe Jackson about a catcher who played class B ball). I found that the movie did a better job in capturing the mystery behind the voice and Ray's quest. We don't know in the movie until much latter and the impact was greater for me. ALSO, I was thoroughly disappointed that the best part of the movie is not in the book; namely the scene where Ray finally talks to his dad and asks him if he'd like to have a catch. That made the experience for me and the book failed to fully capture the essence of the bond of baseball between all of us and their fathers. Instead, all there is Ray telling his father, ""I admire the way you catch"". But I did find most interesting to have Eddie Scissons in the book. He is an interesting and poignant character. The whole funeral scene with the Cubs uniform was great and very moving. On the other hand the brother Richard didn't add much to the story. Although not as moving as the film, it's still a loving ode to baseball and dreams coming true.

I will say that the timeline and events that occur will make more sense if you've enjoyed Rock and Hope's novels. I definitely appreciated having different perspectives on certain scenes that I had previously experienced in the other books. This was a great addition and very thoughtful of the author.

So... Wrath and Trinity take the spotlight. I knew their journey was going to be turbulent, emotional, and gritty. Their love isn't pretty and flawless but it certainly is powerful. I was anxious to discover the truth behind what happened between Trinity and Wrath because the tension was always off the charts when they were in the same room. The story behind these two was fascinating and I greedily ate up every word.

When Wrath first meets the feisty bartender, he wants something different for a change. Trinity can't stop thinking about the bad-boy biker and men with motorcycles should be the farthest thing from her mind. They get three amazing days together before miscommunication and mistakes with permanent damage take an almost instant toll on what could have been. Eight years later, the hostility between Trinity and Wrath has only gained strength. Even though they are clearly crazy for one another, too much has happened for them to attempt trying to work through their issues. Plus one of them has to take the first step and they are both extremely stubborn. Wrath really surprised me and ended up being a totally different man than I originally thought. Never say never...

I enjoyed the three parts to the book and felt it was smart to put some separation between the different sections. For a story expanding over so many years and with so much depth, prepare yourself to be locked down for awhile. The layout was executed wonderfully and the plot was easy to follow.

1474,"We all know the Superman stories, but most of us don't realize that they were created back in the '30's by a teenager, Jerry Siegal, who had just lost his father to murder. Thriller writer Brad Meltzer has been fascinated by this footnote to history, and in The Book of Lies, he weaves a legend of his own around the true story. Cal Harper is in for a shock when the injured homeless man he stops to help turns out to be his long-estranged father. Before the night is out, Cal finds himself in the fight of his life, racing against the US government and the underground Nazi cult of the Thules to find ""the totem"", the ""mark"" God gave to Cain.  Along the way, Cal is forced to reformulate all his ideas about truth, love, trust, and immortality.

The Book of Lies is fun to read, chock full of quirky characters and plot zigs and zags. I didn't find it especially suspenseful, but simply a non-stop, breathless race to get to the prize, whatever it may be, before the bad guys get their hands on it. Of course the Cain/Abel component is fanciful, but the Superman background is factual and compelling. The author has been involved with a movement to save the Siegal house in Cleveland,  and promote public awareness of the legacy of Jerry Siegal.

It will obsess every waking moment and haunt your sleep, so be ready for a totally absorbing read.

The White City of Honduras lived in legend for centuries. Charlatans and con artists claimed its discovery, indigenous people of the region feared its curses, and impenetrable jungle protected its secrets until 2012. And, perhaps it would have been best left undiscovered.

6941,"""The Last Reading"" was a fast paced and highly entertaining light cozy mystery.  Grace is totally believable and likable.  I also liked the ghost Pearl and her no nonsense attitude.  There were several laugh out loud funny moments.  The plot was rather original and interesting.  There wasn't a lot of character development but there was enough for me to like and root for Grace.  I'm sure more will be revealed regarding Rose, as well as, her past as the Series progresses.  We weren't told Grace's age but I got a sense that she was over 40.  The mystery itself was rather simple but there were several suspects so I was kept guessing until the bit reveal.  I was a little surprised by who it turned out to be and that's always a good thing when reading a mystery.  The author's writing style was concise and straight forward.  There wasn't any excessive dialogue or descriptions which frankly works for me in most instances b/c I bore easily.  I'm looking forward to the next novella in this delightful new Series.  If your looking for a lite, fun and interesting cozy mystery, I highly recommend this one.  This book was free when I read it but I could have paid up to 2.99 and I still would have felt that I had gotten my money's worth.  Enjoy!

500,"Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers provides a fascinating and alternative view on the unique, but tiny subset of humans who have been deemed by various societies to be successful. While the general consensus has usually promoted and fostered the notion of intelligence, talent, and hard work as both necessary and sufficient, Gladwell offers novel perspectives on this unique group of ""outliers"" relative to the general population. Although both intelligence and hard work are clearly prerequisites and talent certainly helps, Gladwell identifies several non-obvious determinants such as the timing of birth and individual temporal, geographic, and ethnic cohort effects and then demonstrates their contributions to future individual success. For example, a significant portion of the historically richest individuals are clustered around a common time period such that they were afforded the opportunities to get in on the ground floor of both the railroad and overall industrial revolution. Another example is the clustering of computer whiz-kids all being born in the brief time span in the mid to late 50's. There are other examples of lawyers in one time period, not measuring up to the industry perceptions of having the right stuff, ending up working on less desirable  legal work, only to strike it rich in later years when their skills came into demand.

Other ingredients are unique opportunities that might be regarded as luck, but those individuals not only availed themselves, but also spent enormous amounts of time in practice (leading to the 10,000 hour rule). There is also the impact of specific cultural practices, such as questioning authority that can influence such things like airline safety. While there are very few takeaways, other than lots of practice and being lucky, one corollary is to avoid trying to glean useful tidbits of advice from the myriad articles on what ""rich"" or ""successful"" eat for breakfast, what time they go to sleep, how early they wake up, etc.",3,"[-1.8592384311410706, -1.7128548463092517, -1.0853657607809544, -0.9941038650959433, -1.7777801200174994]",-0.9941038650959433
221,"If you are in the mood for a light and sweet historical, you've come to the right place.  This is a pleasant, enjoyable, and fast read... featuring a daughter no one wanted, finding happiness in the life that her sister threw away.

Annabel was sent to live at an abbey at the age of seven and has lived there ever since, trying to make the best of her lot in life.  She hasn't done well in her training. She enjoys life too much, enjoys food, laughter, and simple joys.  But the abbey is all she has ever known.  So when her mother appears out of the blue and whisks her back to the home she hasn't seen in more than a decade, she has no idea what to make of it.

It turns out that her parents promised the hand of their eldest daughter to the son of an old ally.  Unfortunately, Annabel's big sister Kate ran away with the stable boy and that leaves Annabel to take her place.  She resigns herself to do her parents' bidding, despite the fact she is completely unprepared to be a wife or to run an estate.

Ross is attracted to Annabel right away.  He sees her beauty on the inside and out, and their marriage of convenience quickly becomes one in truth. It's really very sweet. There's not really an internal conflict; no lies or stupid choices.  No big misunderstanding.  We just get to watch these two fall in love.  Ross is a noble and good leader to his people. He is a caring and understanding husband.  Annabel is pure of heart. She wants to be a good wife to her new husband and a good lady to his people. How could you not root for these two?

It's not all smooth sailing. Someone is trying to kidnap Annabel.  The big issue of the book centers on keeping her safe while figuring out who is after her and way.  When all is revealed, it's a fairly satisfying conclusion.  It's not very deep.  By that, I mean, it is not in anyway emotionally taxing or challenging.  But sometimes, a feel good story is what you need.  The love story is nice; the sex is good; and the plot wasn't overly predictable.  There were times some of the characters stretched close to caricatures, especially members of Annabel's family.  But overall, I found it an enjoyable read.

Elise Sandburg is a detective in Savannah, Georgia. She has a daughter Audrey who she had as a teenager. Audrey lives with her ex husband and his wife and twins.
Elise is paired with a new detective, David, who is a former FBI agent, and a Yankee, who has come to Savannah to get away from his sad past.
In the books beginnings David is on antidepressants and Elise is not impressed with his lack of emotion. Soon he goes off them, which is dangerous to do cold turkey and he suffers from it.
Elise was abandoned as an infant in a cemetery and adopted by a family but said she was cared for very well but not really loved.
Her father was supposed to be a famous root doctor and when she was a young teen she studied the skill herself with a neighbor.
Someone in Savannah is using a substance to make people appear dead, then later die. The city is in a panic thinking that someone is making zombies.
Elise and David are charged with finding the killer.
This is a very well written book. I liked all the main characters. The references to root doctoring, which apparently is not the same as voodoo, were interesting. I already want to read the next book in the series.

Krueger has established a wonderful community of characters which includes Henry Meloux who brings an element of wisdom and a strong metaphysical aspect into the storyThe heart knows much that the head ignores.  If we pay attention, our hearts speak to us.  Stephen OConnor as always listened.as well as a look into the culture of the Objibwe Indians.  The use of the native language, followed by translations, adds realism and is very effective.  Corks sister-in-law, being Catholic, does bring as aspect of religion to the story, but it doesnt overwhelm the plot, nor become too preachy but is simply an aspect of the character.

The action is split between locations, which heightens the tension and suspense as well as the sense of threat.  There are several, well-placed and very effective plot twists.  The climax is exciting, even though the logic of it working seemed improbable.  But thats why its called fiction.  However, it is, in many ways, a very spiritual book which causes one to stop and consider.

2198,"Laurie Alice Eakes in her new book, ""A Flight of Fancy"" Book Two in The Daughters Of Bainbridge House series published by Revell brings us into the life of Cassandra Bainbridge in 1812.

From the back cover:  Her head is in the clouds. His feet are planted firmly on the ground. Can love cover the distance?

Cassandra Bainbridge may be a bit of a bluestocking, but when Geoffrey Giles is near, love seems a fine alternative to passion for Greek and the physics of flight. With his dashing good looks and undying devotion to her, the earl of Whittaker sets Cassandra's heart racing with his very presence. It seems his only flaw is his distaste for ballooning, the obsession that consumes so much of her thoughts.

When a terrible accident compels her to end her betrothal, Cassandra heads for the country to recover from both her injuries and her broken heart. With time on her hands and good friends to help her, she pursues her love for ballooning and envisions a future for herself as a daring aeronaut. But when Lord Whittaker slips back into her life, will she have to choose between him and her dream?

""A Flight of Fancy"" is a wonderful romance filled with mystery, intrigue, and scandal.  This is a page-turner that will keep you guessing right until the end.  These pages are filled with wonderful characters that live and breathe.  ""A Flight of Fancy"" is full of following your dreams, a woman's place in society and breaking away from that place and romance.  This is an interesting story filled with lots of excitement and romance as well as history.  I liked it a lot and am looking forward to the next book.

This time we are introduced to the mysterious Gavin Cooke.
Gavin is a tortured soul. Seeing only the twisted evil in this world, his escape is his work and his booze. Not much else can grab his attention for long. After everything he's been through, he deserves a little liquor.

Savannah Shepherd is as sweet as they come. Working to make her own world a little better, she barely stops long enough to take care of herself. She's determined to stand on her own two feet. If that means she eats a little less, sleeps a little less, then so be it.

Gavin and Savannah collide at two opposite ends of the spectrum. The chemistry is unavoidable, the submission is oh so sweet. As Gavin builds Savannah up, Savannah keeps him feeling alive. What they draw from each other is everything they need.

the influx of immigrants: ""during my stroll I had noticed the occasional passer-by whose Aryan ancestry was questionable, to put it mildly... it was still a mystery what these racial aliens were doing here.""
when offered an instant coffee ""the British must still be blockading the seas...the brave, stoic German Volk had been forced to make do with substitutes for so long.""
The shock of a woman president, poorly-behaved young people who don't measure up to the Hitler Youth, even the computer...

But Hitler is soon discovered and offered a place on a TV show, as an alternative comedian, impersonating the dictator....

While many will find any novel on Hitler tasteless, I have to say I found the premise interesting. At a time when there are divisions in the European community, when unchecked immigration has led to anger and the growth of far-right parties, what actually WOULD happen if Hitler turned up again now? Would some people have time for him?

This is an excellent translation: much of the conversation is in typical 'young person's slang' as Hitler mixes with people in the media, and translator Jamie Bulloch does a convincing job of modern anglicisms: ""LOL"", that's like so cool"" etc.

9902,"Over the years; I've used several two-in-one shower systems, most notably by Waterpik. This Delta unit is far and away much superior to anything made by them. It's extremely easy to install, requiring no tools and just a small amount of white plumbing tape to ensure there are no leaks. While the water pressure is adequate when the entire head is being used, when the flow is restricted to just the hand-held unit; it's more than adequate. I usually use the setting where the entire shower head dispenses water, and find that the head distributes an even flow of water over a very wide area. As mentioned; the hand-held unit provides plenty of pressure and the hose is very easy to move around. The only tiny quirk with the shower head, is that when you first turn it on; there's a split second where the remaining water comes out of the head. If you're very sensitive to cold water; you might want to turn the shower head on, than enter the shower. This is a very minor issue, but could bother some people, especially in the winter when the ambient temperature is colder. Other than that, this is the nicest dual shower head that I've used to date.

2206,"The best way to describe Roxane Gays debut novel is harrowing. It picks right up and it never lets up, never lets you go.

While visiting her wealthy parents in Haiti with her American husband and newborn son, Miri is kidnapped in broad daylight by a group of young men. It is understood that they will hold her hostage until her father pays them the sum that they demand. Miri and her family are familiar with these scenarios: it should be relatively simple.

Its not simple. When her father stubbornly refuses to pay up, Miri is forced to endure 12 endless days of unrelenting brutality that will leave her forever changed.

As compelling as Gays prose is, Ill admit that it took me some time to really feel fully engaged with Miri. The events unfold so rapidly at first, doing a lot of telling rather than showing. Miri, her husband and her parents act in ways that are frustrating and sometimes infuriating.

Its the flashbacks to Miris life before that really pull everything together: painting a full picture of who she is and how wonderful her life once was while providing a jarring and devastating juxtaposition to the present.

This book got better for me as it went on, building to a beautiful and powerful second half. Stories often end once someone is rescued, a mercy to those of us reading or watching: finally we can breathe a collective sigh of relief. But Gays novel takes us through the afterand somehow, bafflingly, its even more devastating than what preceded it.

Its bold to write a book like this that refuses to offer any catharsis. This one will stick with me for a long time.",4,"[-1.7707891538235752, -1.1529292443355306, -1.01008751919096, -1.0213810106558394, -0.9954128770119972]",-0.9954128770119972

With a degree in design, the idea of accepting a job with a branding company seems brilliant, but her salary is small and the area of London where she's found an affordable flat is no where close to the office. Unfortunately, none of that matters when she's faced with her brilliant new boss, Demeter. The title, ""Most Disorganized Human Being,"" doesn't seem to be an over estimation. Demeter seems to always be making statements that she, in utter confusion minutes later, retracts or tries to make sense of. Only her personal assistant seems able to keep her from disaster. She even seems to forget that she's failed to make an employee ""redundant"" or fired, as the English say.

3002,"Regardless of which side of the aisle you tend to support, there is no denying that the 2016 presidential election was one for the history books. Up until the moment the results were tallied, Hillary Clinton was the odds on favorite to defeat Donald Trump for the presidency. As we are all aware, things did not turn out as planned for Clinton. The shock of the loss had her and her supporters wonderings, ""What happened?!"" In this tell all book, Clinton attempts to answer just that.

I was immediately taken by how candid Clinton is. Several times during the book I found myself thinking that if she had been this open during the campaign, things might have ended differently. Say what you will about Trump, but he definitely has no reservations about saying exactly what is on his mind. Clinton admits to taking a more traditional approach to the process, playing politics by the rules. By her own accounts, she played that game quite well. The only problem is that Trump was playing a radically different game.

Beyond President Trump's unorthodox and often morally questionable political tactics, Clinton spends a good portion of the book commenting on the uphill battle she had as the country's first female presidential candidate.  She writes, ""In my experience, the balancing act women in politics have to master is challenging at every level, but it gets worse the higher you rise."" Clinton considers herself to be highly qualified for the job of being the president. She served successful terms as both a senator and secretary of state. But she couldn't shake the criticisms of her clothing, speaking voice, and overall demeanor. While she may not have broken the glass ceiling, she writes of her hope that the cracks she made into it will make the task of breaking it a bit easier for future women.

I found myself completely engrossed throughout the entire book. Clinton manages to mingle her political observations with deeply personal reflections about her journey. She writes with candor about the shock of losing a race everyone thought she would win. Despite her disagreements with the man currently occupying the White House, she seems hopeful about the future of the country. Whatever your political affiliations, What Happened is one of the most revealing books that was written this year. Clinton's firsthand accounts perfectly capture the events that helped shape the moment in history that we are currently in.",3,"[-4.226247447971293, -2.0073108755898894, -1.4821955286741804, -0.9956270068559858, -1.506989156556796]",-0.9956270068559858

4918,"If you like mystery/police procedurals, then Stephen Puleston is an author you should follow. His books take place in Wales, the North has DI Drake and the South has DI Marco. I have been a fan of DI Drake up to this point because of his peculiar behaviors and environment, but DI Marco won me over.

Marco is based in Cardiff, and the countryside becomes a part of the storyline. This is a mystery/thriller that hinges on a dead man, nefarious deeds and betrayals. But it begins with a spectacular death of a man found in the river Taff in Cardiff, with his tongue amputated.  The man comes from the Polish community in Cardiff, and soon DI Marco is investigating prostitution and human trafficking. As the clues come together, DI Marco finds himself in Poland to hunt down the criminal who is removing the tongues of his victims. Even though Marco is single and enjoys this life, lonely as it is, he realizes family comes first. As the story unfolds, the case becomes fraught with tension as people are put in jeopardy, and Marco and his team must solve this case. The ending is surprising, I thought many times that I had the answer, but alas.

Stephen Puleston, has become one of my favorite authors. The characters in his books all have explicit personalities that are more than interesting. After a bit, they start to feel like part of the family. Most of them have issues like we all do, and we can identify with them. The mystery/police procedurals are all very different, and a bit unusual. And, to see Wales from a countryman's view is the best way to visit a country.

975,"Author John Birmingham enjoys producing ""what if?"" novels with interesting themes.  His first trilogy was about a modern battlefleet being caught in a time warp and dropped back in WW2.  And the subsequent impact on WW2.

In this we have a mysterious energy wave that drops on the most of the US (and bits of Canada and Cuba) and wipes out all humans leaving an impenetrable barrier.  That is the early set up and the book then gives us a perspective of a few set characters and a vision of what would happen to the world if the US suddenly was no longer in the picture.  It is also set back in the time when the coalition forces were sitting in Kuwait about to kick off he invasion of Iraq, so this happens when significant American forces are outside the US but suddenly have no command structure.

So along with individual stories, we have how the world economy reacts, how different countries react and how the isolated elements of the US deal with their new position.  It's very dark and felt very well researched with considerable thought.  It essentially is the story of a world in collapse through the eyes of a number of individuals.  The author also gives real people roles and reactions (for instance Blair as UK Prime Minister basically seals up Britain after chucking out any `undesirables') which made it feel very realistic.  It is in essence a techno-thriller but a very intelligent one.

I will be honest and tell you it took me a bit to figure out what was really going on but the wonderful writing and suspense kept me turning page after page to try and figure out what was happening. It was worth it because this is an exceptional book.

We are introduced to the hero of the book right away. Charlie is a guy that other men want for their best friend and women love because of his strength and loyalty. He's a ""risk containment specialist"" and he's used to dealing with difficult situations. He also seems to enjoy the risk that comes with these situations.

I also liked Gabriella even though I wasn't sure what was really going on with her. Her experiments are part of the plot that kept me coming back asking, what next? I liked her easy personality and could understand why Charlie would trust her.

This is definitely a story that's ""out there"", but then, in this genre, that's what makes it extra good. You want to be asking yourself if this could really happen or not. It's a story that keeps your mind turning and I enjoy that a lot. I give this book 5 out of 5 stars.

My problem with the product pertained mainly to the first use.  The cardboard backing that is attached to the tape roll makes it very difficult to rotate the roll, but I found removing the backing to be near-impossible, as little bits stuck to the roll.  Getting the tape started was also a challenge, as you are required to unwind several layers--and thus waste quite a bit of the product--before getting to the double-sided portion.

6392,"RIDING LIL' RED HARD - Is Blazing-Hot. A whirlwind story that enticed me to keep reading until the filled-with-happiness ending. After reading this story and you settle into sleep you might find yourself in a fantasy dream about the muscled hero with the bedroom blue eyes. Mr. Cleveland breaks the barrier with this sizzling adult fairy tale breathing life into his characters and leaving you wanting more. Inside; suspense, spine-chilling action, witty dialogue, dynamic vivid scene descriptions, life-threatening - emotional moments, and intense fiery sensuous romance.

Ryan a sultry ex-Navy Seal is a wanderer of sorts, the freedom journeying the open road on his Harley proving to himself he survived; voices and images haunt him daily from a nightmarish deployment. Desperate to escape the visions in his mind he goes to a shabby pub where he meets bartender Red who sets his body on Fire. Red has flaming hair is a bit cheeky and has a crazy abusive ex-boyfriend. A bet has Ryan taking her far from the ex to her grandmother's home.
Getting to their joyous ending is quite a Wild Ride!

A noteworthy read that had me laughing, a bit on edge, left me breathless, feeling for the characters and cheering for them too; I waited months for this story and it certainly was worth the wait. I have read many takes on the fairy tale Riding Hood, but this surpasses them all; you can't give a book more than 5 stars - but this story was a Touch Down for me and that is the best you can get. Character history helps you understand their emotions. Red is definitely a perfect match for strong-willed Ryan; loved them together. If you treasure adult fairy tales this is a fabulous book for your library. I found this story to be quite entertaining and enjoyed it so much {I voluntarily reviewed an advanced copy and bought the book too.} Without reservations, I recommend this read.",3,"[-3.1656174718478196, -2.3769083360143615, -1.0913080308410508, -0.9962155296242734, -1.316205815674871]",-0.9962155296242734
584,"One more necessary lesson and safety tip from among the hundreds that Dresden has provided in his chronicles.

Having read all the Dresden books, I always anxiously await the next episode. Amazon reviewers have dissected Butcher's writings well enough that one more Turncoat review seems unnecessary. BUT ... a review of Buthcher's Dresden creation in total may be useful for someone looking for a great series to immerse themselves into.

Finding a ""great"" series to spend an enjoyable hundred hours or so is a tricky business as the avid reader well knows.  I can report that there are few series that I've enjoyed more than shadowing the wizard Dresden in his exploits around Chicago and both the seen and unseen worlds. Buthcher is a master of word imagery in a nouveau-arcane way. Buthcher's style is quite unique and contagious. He writes with affection for the story and it's characters as few can do. He introduces such smart-alecky, word-thoughts that you can barely refrain from injecting them in casual conversation.

Dresden and every friend and enemy along his path combine to create a raucously mundane story about your above average wizard just trying to make a buck and save the planet from the forces of evil. Buthcher makes it all work ... he's got an `industry' going here that must be coveted by his authorial peers.

Read every Dresden book. They're worth twice the price.",2,"[-2.4171236282935267, -1.1395964969674144, -0.9962554397014699, -1.0417440887571974, -1.0545566124477803]",-0.9962554397014699

Delaney and her friends Caitlin, Lyssa and Megan are off to Barcelona for a weekend of fun, but instead it turns out to be a nightmare.  Delaney knew Darios would be trouble the minute she saw him; nevertheless, she has finally met someone who is able to challenge her.  Darios has built a respectful reputation in the Georgian Mafia as a feared hitman, whose demands are never taken likely, but Delaney is a distraction. This has consequences when his operation is attacked by mercenaries, and an old adversary comes back into Darios life.  Fearing for Delaneys life, Darios gives her the opportunity to return to her parents, but she refuses. Darios is a kidnapper, a con man, a murderer and he should terrify her, but her survival instincts are nothing compared to her feelings for Darios, a man who grew up in a world of violence and poverty. When Caitlin is taken away in the middle of the night, something just doesnt seem right, and it isnt.  A police raid forces Darios to lay low, but in the slums of El Raval, Delaney sees a different side to the man she is in love with.  After hearing every detail of Darios life, Delaney is ashamed; it has taken losing everything to finally become a version of herself she likes.  Tipped off by an Interpol Agent, Darios is warned that the Spanish Authorities have a heinous plan in mind that endangers not only his Organisation, but the lives of his hostages.

Her grannys matchmaking with thirteenth-century Highlanders isn't about to lure her into the past, especially as ancient Scotland enters troubled times. After all, Lilia is blessedor cursedwith dire prophetic visions. To protect herself, shes put up an icy emotional wall no man could crossuntil a pair of gorgeous, rippling arms breaks right through.

Graham MacTavish is pure trouble. Once the dragon bound to Loch Ness, hes transformed into a philanderer of the first order. In fact, because of his dalliances with other mens wives, a rival clan wants his head on a pike. Before he provokes an all-out war, Graham is banished to the twenty-first century, where he must win Lilias handor return to die. But after meeting a lass as fierce as any Highland warrior, Graham knows one thing: life with Lilia, in any century, is a fate to embrace.

Review:

In this final installment of this series we get to know the final Sinclair sister Lilia.  She is paired with our favorite dragon transformed back into man, Graham.

Graham is quite the philanderer and he has finally pushed it too far and is banished.  Lilia's grandmother and sister send Graham to the twenty-first century to help Lilia since her guardian is dying and they have a premonition that Graham and Lilia are meant to be together.

The story that ensues is an exciting and entertaining time-travel romance.  I liked that the story was written in a style that grabbed my attention and kept me reading.  I loved the witty dialogue, that had me laughing at times.  The inclusion of LARP-ing and the intro to twenty-first century sex toys was fun to read. The gamut of emotions running through the story, I was sad when Lilia's guardian dies but the ending leaves you happy and was very satisfying in it's wrap up of the series.  Of course, the story has is spicy, sexy elements too.  Lilia and Graham are very sexy together and the chemistry is off the charts.  I am sad to see this series go, but like I said the wrap up at the end is well-done and will leave you happy.

2574,"We start out with a regular human girl, Anaea, standing on a bridge contemplating the final moments of her life. She is in the final stages of cancer and the doctors don't give her much longer to live. She has decided not to sit by and wither, but to end her life now while she still has the strength. As she is preparing for the final dive into the icy waters below, Hunter sees her and tries to stop her. He is a dragon spirit but in human form. Before he can pull her from the bridge, someone steps up and stabs him with a sword. As they both plunge into the icy water, his spirit slips into Anaea. Even though Anaea was ready to face her final destiny, she does not plan on doing it while possessed by some dude she just met.
There were so many things I really enjoyed about this book. Even though Anaea was ready to die, I enjoyed Anaea's fiery spirit and her fight to remain in control of herself to the end. I especially like how Hunter kept thinking of Anaea as a dragon and wanted to give her shiny things or jump around spouting fire to impress her. I also enjoyed how Hunter and Anaea were drawn together and not just thrown into bed together.",3,"[-2.4314209039775725, -1.8403508986696584, -1.1251842117684723, -0.9964474824273081, -1.0876007057640014]",-0.9964474824273081
38,"While traveling north to visit a friend, Elspeth McGillicuddy's train pulls alongside another train going in the same direction. For a few minutes, the two trains seem to stand still, going at the same speed, and during those moments, the window shade of the other train flies up, allowing Mrs. McGillicuddy to witness a man strangling a woman. Upon arriving at the next station, she immediately alerts the railway, and at her final destination (visiting friend Miss Jane Marple), the two contact the police. Unfortunately for the ladies, no body has been found, and some are doubting that a crime was ever committed. But Miss Marple knows her friend, and knows that a body must be somewhere. With the use of maps and by taking the train itself, she figures out the only place it could be, and sends a young maid, Lucy Eyelesbarrow, to work at an estate that happens to be where the body must have ended up. Unsurprisingly, Lucy finds it. But who is the young woman? Why was she killed? And who moved her body to a stone sarcophagus at Rutherford Hall?

""4:50 From Paddington"" (also published as ""What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw"") is a tale of murder and intrigue in rural England. The estate owner is a cranky old man who is convinced his children want him to die so they can inherit his money. His children are, for the most part, not particularly nice individuals, each with a motive to want the old man dead - but not some strange woman. Could the murderer be amongst the family? Or is it a case of their home simply being in a prime location? Who would know how to hide a body there? And when others start being killed, what could the motive possibly be?

As always, Agatha Christie finds a way to create a mystery with a plot you've not seen before. Once again, Miss Marple, using only her wits, is able to solve it. Like all Christie murders, the clues are there, and it's up to the reader to put them together. And, like most of her novels, she's always too clever for me.",4,"[-2.757140706983389, -1.7286948135363867, -1.0059939248387393, -1.0391874154877663, -0.9965796900889308]",-0.9965796900889308

5722,"Oh my goodness! PLAYING WITH FIRE is scorching hot and sexy read! I expected nothing less about the legend that was Cowboy from author Alison Bliss as a follow-up to her debut book, Rules of Protection, and nothing less than excellence is what she gives her readers. Again. The plot is sexy and romantic, yet mysterious with a dash of danger. The characters have fun, yet realistic, well-developed personalities and the dialogue is charming with just the right amount of wit and snark. The core group from the first book in the Tangled in Texas series, ROP, are all back. Their friendships establishing a strong base and balance for the story.

Cowboy, the local legend and player, doesn't know what to think of the pretty new librarian. His usual charm and panty-melting grin doesn't seem to have the same power over her. Despite his best, and very consistent, efforts to get her to go out with him, she keeps shutting him down. He's not used to being told no and is only more intrigued by her refusal. Anna Weber isn't as immune to Cowboy's charm as she tries to make him believe, but she has too many secrets of her own to give into the temptation. She's all too aware of his reputation and doesn't want to get burned, so she fights her desire for him even though he's clearly irresistible.

Loved this book! I love it when the unexpected woman brings the player to his knees. Throw in a little danger, some intrigue, a lot of laughs, and steamy sexin' scenes on the way to the HEA and you've got a book I didn't want to put down. 4.5 stars

Ret has grown bored of his sex life. He wants more than just a submissive for the night. He wants to find a submissive he could be a Dom to for the rest of his life. He doesn't just want a delicate flower that doesn't have a backbone, he wants one with some feistiness that makes his cock twitch. And when he sees Alese, a switch, he wants her. He wants to show her who she really is...a submissive through and through.

Alese might be a switch but she has craved Ret's touch for the last few months. She fights between being a sub and a Domme but she knows Ret is all Dom. But when he shows interest in showing her what he can bring into her life, she agrees to his terms. To be his sub for the next week. To show her that she is nothing but a submissive that doesn't like to give up control. That she just hasn't found the right man to trust. To give her what she craves...

Have Ret and Alese met their perfect match? Can Alese give up her control or will she bring Ret to his knees and show him her Domme side?

Their viewpoints make their newfound fake relationship shaky as they continue the charade due to Abbi's ex.

In fact, I was using a big ZipLoc bag to put everything in just to keep everything in one place.

So, after looking around at various options, I tried this case out.  It is terrific.

1.  What's in the box:?  You receive the nice sized bag, which is about the size of a large, dense paperback book, and within it, many cut-outs of the foam protection inside.

2.  Aesthetic?:  This is a nice looking case.  The texture on the case is really a nice feature, plus the red trim makes this feel and look like an expensive piece of equipment.  And why not?  If you are like me, the GoPro is going out on many adventures in places where the camera needs protection when not in use.

3.  Use?: The bag feels like it is well-made, especially for the money paid.  The foam inserts can be manipulated by the user to adjust for the various things you may have like extra mounts, for example.  Also, this allows for storage of the various versions of the GoPro.  The great feature is the zippered pocket on the top flap.  Here I store things like extra memory cards and adapters (for those micro SD cards), booklets, extra mounts and covers and whatever else I might lose or need during a trip with the camera.

Overall?:  This is a very nice thing to have for a GoPro owner.  For the money being spent, it is really a necessity to keep everything neatly organized.  The only quibble I would have is the attached strap holder is probably not something I would depend on with a fully loaded bag, and the small carabiner is nice, but not a depend on your life kind of item.

A brother no one knew about.
Tully Morgan's life hasn't been easy and it's about to get even more complicated.

Tully is coming home to help her mother (who everyone thinks is her sister) in her final stages of cancer. She wants to finally make amends with her and try to build some kind of relationship before her time is up. At the chocolate shop buying candy for her mother Sugar, she runs into Ren Fletcher, the boy she stood up for their date when she left home for California after finding out Sugar (the addict who came and left as she pleased) really wasn't her sister, but her mother. Ren has changed. He's no longer the nerdy boy he used to be. He's grown into an attractive man who is now a lawyer in the town of Marietta where they grew up. Lots of memories come back. Ren is in the process of divorcing his wife, the girl he hooked up with after prom.
Can you really turn back the clock and make up for lost time?

Sugar had done four good things in her life, she gotten clean, gone off the game, gave her son up for adoption and now found him. She was running out of time. Can she fit in one more good thing before it's too late? Can she do the sweetest thing yet?

427,"Christopher is a 15-year-old who loves and remembers facts and who is a whiz at math; whose literary hero is Sherlock Holmes because of the detective's adherence to logic in solving crimes; who relates better to animals than to people; who hates to be touched and refuses to look at others directly. He is autistic.

Out for a night-time ramble, Christopher sees that the neighbor's dog has been killed, stabbed with a garden fork. Deciding to solve the mystery of the killing, he begins interviewing the neighbors, only to find out more secrets than he anticipated, secrets about his own family.

Christopher is the narrator of this story, and thus the language is factual (without the use of metaphors and similes, which Christopher considers lies), and includes mathematical formulas and random facts.

Author Mark Haddon does a remarkable job of telling the story through the eyes of an autistic boy. As Christopher relates just the facts that he knows, the reader is able to anticipate the truths, although Christopher does not. The reader not familiar with this spectrum of mental aberration can also gain insights about the thought processes involved and about the family pressures that can surround a child with this disorder.

This book was very interesting, but I don't think I will ever read it again (which is, ultimately, how I judge a book).

Within months of one another, two key staff members of a prominent cosmetics firm have committed suicide. The only thing connecting them other than their employment is the fact they attended a company retreat which seems to have altered their character. That and the fact they received an anonymous email with a strange attachmenta photo of hanged dogs and a message, Never forget.

This strange message brings the case to the attention of the Mossos, and Salgado is certain the company officials and others who attended the retreat are keeping secrets.

Leire Castro, Salgados second in the previous novel, is on maternity leave. Bored, she launches an unofficial investigation of Ruths disappearance, one that leads her down some unexpected avenues and precipitates an unintended clash between Salgado and the agent assigned to the case.

Hill tells his story from varied viewpoints, including that of the inspector, Leire and the cosmetic company personnel, which gives the reader a wider impression of the personalities involved and their various motivations.

It's always worth trying out a new healthy food alternative for your pet, but, ultimately, it is up to their own particular preferences on whether they will actually eat!

Angela, the heroine, is thirty-three and single but looking for a love she can settle down with.

She wanted to study the culinary arts because she developed a love for cooking from her Italian grandmother, but her parents talked her out of it. Now she's an event-planner for a NY museum, a job she's so good at, she can do it with her eyes closed.

When her best friend finds a significant other online, Angela is timid about giving it a try but eventually finds a man's profile that calls to her. He responds, even writes haiku just for her. When they do connect, she's sure he's the perfect man for her.

Only he's in Maine.

Thinking about him and worrying whether she should take a chance and give up her life for him, makes her sloppy at work. She forgets to sign up for fire insurance when the event she plans hires a fire eater for the circus theme. It wouldn't matter except that the fire eater gets into a fight with the juggler and before anyone can react, the place is on fire.

In Maine, she doesn't find what she expects, but she does find what she needs.

1233,"If you find yourself wanting to read noir crime fiction, read the best--and this is the best (although Raymond Chandler fans might disagree). Hammett invented the ""hard-boiled"" detective, writing with a gritty style, witty and fast-paced dialogue, and picture-perfect character descriptions. His hero has a strong sense of right and wrong, but does not back away from letting the ends justify the means in cleaning things up.

In this novel, the Continental Detective Agency operative (never named) is brought into town by the newspaper's publisher, who turns out to be dead by the time the operative arrives. Soon finding out that the town is ""owned"" by the dead man's father, the operative finagles a contract from the father to clean up the town, which has been taken over by four gang factions (and a crooked police force), who had originally been brought to town by the same father to break a labor strike. The plot from here on is very complicated, with the operative cleverly pitting gang against gang, leading them to all-out warfare. In the process, the body count mounts, but the operative escapes harm, through cunning and just blind luck.

All this ""red harvest"" is almost too much for even the jaded operative, who says he is finding joy in the killing and is going ""blood-simple.""

The dialogue here is smart and stylish, the hero is appropriately jaded, and the plot is clever. Most of all, this dark world seems absolutely authentic and perhaps still exists, though in a more sophisticated and clandestine form; I would be willing to bet that criminals today are just as sordid and amoral as they were in 1929.

Harry Hinds gladly comes with him, but unfortunately, we leave the Coconut (Judge Acosta) behind in this new thriller.  The title initially led me to think Madriani himself would be on trial in this one, just like Acosta was in ""The Judge"".  However, the story is another standard Madriani tale, much like ""Compelling Evidence"" or ""Undue Influence"".  Our hero has a new girlfriend in this one, and his relationship with her causes some professional issues.  He initially starts out with his client in an attempt to find a way to bring legal pressure to get his kidnapped grandaughter back from his estranged daughter.  However, this quickly turns into a murder case as the grandfather is linked by the police to the death of an unattractive woman whose crusade is to help women steal children away from oppressive men.  We also get caught up with a Mexican drug dealer, some mysterious DEA (?) agents, and other dead bodies along the way. In the end, Martini throws in the twist out of nowhere to shock us with the truth about the killer.  My only complaint is that Martini could have added a couple of more pages of explanation as to how all of the evidence fit into the true killer's story.",3,"[-2.5020813232322223, -1.0247231257510774, -1.0153479019540739, -0.9989243699484176, -1.4805157794129695]",-0.9989243699484176

9899,"In addition to appreciating the reviews here that speak well of this product's performance and persuaded me to buy it,  I also appreciate its small (5""x3""x2"")size, and that its reader-friendly user guide includes:  (1) Both an easy-to-find list of  the multiplicity of places where you should NOT put a CO detector--which in my smallish house reduces the options considerably--and a (much shorter) list of locations where it should work best, along with easy-to-understand explanations of the whys of all that. (2) That it makes the should-be-easy-to-remember suggestion that you replace its  three  AA batteries every time you reset the clocks and  recommends several brands--presumably ones that  should last at least that long between changes.  (3) That it provides a space on the side of the device to write in  the date, seven years from now, when the device itself needs replacing--a placement where you're most likely to notice it whenever you take it off the wall to change the batteries.

Now, if only monoxide and smoke detector makers could  find more forgiving  ways to call our attention to a shorter-than-expected battery life, or our occasional  maintenance tardiness, than sending us stumbling, bleary eyed and half awake, all over the house in the middle of the night, trying to figure out and silence whichever of our household's protective devices is not only NOT alarmed about anything, but just screaming  its decibels out that it needs a new battery.

In the meantime: 1. Read user guide re placement before picking a spot and drilling holes in the wall.  2. Figure out what this year's time change dates are for where you live and mark them on your calendar with note to replace all detector batteries. 3. Write the seven-years-hence replacement date on the side of the device, as indicated.

This product seemed to be in the retinol range that was about right for me, so I was interested in trying it, and I have been using it nightly for about three weeks now--perhaps not yet enough time to see major changes, but I wanted to provide at least a preliminary review.

The good news is that I have not experienced any skin problems related to this product.  I know that retinol can cause breakouts, and I was concerned about this, especially given that I can be prone to acne, but I have not had this issue at all, so I was pleased.  In terms of improvement in my skin's appearance, I haven't noticed anything major.  It does seem like on the mornings after I use the product, my skin has a slightly more ""tight"" appearance--i.e., drier, less oily than usual.  But otherwise, I will need to continue l using the product for long to see whether I experience more significant benefits.

The major downside to this product is the packaging.  It comes in a small squeeze tube with a pull-off cap. To dispense the produce, you must squeeze the tube, and there is a TINY hole at the top which releases the product.  This process is VERY difficult, and it has only become harder as I have used the product.  This past past week, when I was squeezing the tube, the entire top popped off, and the product splattered all over.  (Note:  this has happened to other reviewers as well.)  The tube wasn't very fully to begin with, so it is disappointing to lose product in this manner.  Plus, the top will NOT pop back on, so now I have to reach into the exposed tube itself to use the product, which isn't particularly sanitary.

Based on my knowledge so far, I would be hesitant to recommend this product.  However, I will keep using it and will report back if I see improved results.",3,"[-1.6788441735174109, -1.1982059839161483, -1.0113626149041544, -0.9989743762656885, -1.2871703402923034]",-0.9989743762656885

It does not end with a cliffhanger but there is definitely much more to be explored story wise. It has a ""comfortable"" ending so I don't feel like I've been left dangling but I am definitely looking forward to book 2.

This is a quick, easy and very enjoyable read. Good characters and an exciting story. The major players are college students so while it's not exactly YA, it's not exactly Adult either. It feels like it would make a great TV series (one of the characters actually wonders, jokingly, if there will be a tv made about their experience).

For anyone who has read ""We are Legion"" (Bobiverse book 1), this is very different thematically but it still has sci-fi elements and may appeal to fans.

The thing is, the Octopus tells Spirit that they've got more in common than he knows.  Neither of them can die, for instance, but the Spirit doesn't know why.

Now he's got even more trouble.  Old flame Sand Serif (Eva Mendez) is back in town and she's in league with his nemesis to acquire relics from Olympus itself.

""The Spirit"" is shot in the noir style of director Frank Miller's successful ""Sin City.""  The dialogue is pure film noir with a whole lot of camp and cliche thrown in, some from Will Eisner's original comic book series homage from many of the B detective films you've seen through the years.

While the film was not billed as a comedy, it was hard not to laugh at the lines and situations.  Samuel L. Jackson makes a great arch-villain and his  monologueing is just classic.  Male fanboys are going to enjoy the various femme fatales in the film, including Sand Serif, Silken Floss (Scarlett Johansen), and Officer Morganstern (Stana Katic) who gives the best line in the whole film.

In this one, life circumstances have changed his lifestyle dramatically. He's living a stressful, secret life and struggling to keep moving forward, knowing that at any time everything could come crashing down on him. Scarlet, who legally changed her name over the summer, has just endured a lonely, ostracized senior year due to the criminal indictment and looming trial of her father. In her small town, she's guilty by being related. Her father, to whom she's never been close, was verbally abusive in the past and is distant now. Her mother is worried about keeping up appearances and doesn't spare a thought to what the situation is doing to her daughter. She's pressing for Scarlet to help present a united, harmonious front. Scarlet sees going to college as her escape. There she meets Bridger and their tentative friendship develops into a romance that grounds and enriches both of them. But when secrets are revealed and circumstances become desperate, their relationship is pushed to its limits.  I felt such empathy for both Bridger and Scarlet. I totally understand the bind he was in, but feel Scarlet should have trusted him with her past after she discovered the mystery of his life. I really disliked her mother (how could she shrug off her daughter being slapped by the father's bodyguard?) and Azzad, the bodyguard.  The book didn't address this, but I sincerely wished that Scarlet would've pressed charges against him for the illegal software he put on her phone, his actions Thanksgiving weekend, and the slapping. Of course, I disliked the father, too. In Scarlet's place, I doubt I would have spoken to him at all when I was forced back home. No way he should've gotten away with that.

She can't sleep without having nightmares; she can't walk around without people staring and whispering. But she won't curl up and quit.  When one of the Reapers poisons her boss at the library, there's no doubt the search for a cure will lead to a trap.  That doesn't stop Gwen from gathering her friends and hitting the road to do what's necessary.

The gang takes a road trip. Of course, there are fights with Reapers, as well as a host of mythological entities --both old and new.  It's what gives the series its individual flavor. The world-building stays consistent and fairly interesting.  And all of the major characters in Gwen's life are back to play a part.

I like that we continue to see Gwen evolve in this series.  Her powers are getting stronger, but more than that, we are seeing her inner strength growing as well.  I like that she retains her soft heart and her emotional vulnerability, that she stays true to the core of who she is, no matter what she endures.  And we see it pay off. What makes her a champion is a combination of her power and her humanity.

The romantic element is... ok.  Obviously, we're dealing with feelings and repercussions from the last book.  I thought the resolution on it all was a bit understated.  But I am glad Jennifer Estep did not choose to drag is out over several books.  I'm ok with how it played out.

I think the best things that the book (and series) have going are the overall Loki arc --and Gwen's evolution as a heroine.

5555,"FIGHTING LOVE is the latest storyline in Abby Niles contemporary, adult Love to the Extreme series. Although this is the second in the series it can be read as a stand alone. This is Tommy and Julie's storyline-Tommy is a former MMA champion and Julie is the woman he has loved most of his life.

The premise focuses on the friends to lovers relationship between two people who refuse to acknowledge the obvious-they have loved one another since they were ten years old but life and Tommy's career as a fighter got in the way. Julie has always been at Tommy's side-through the good times and the bad-but she refuses to allow herself to be ignored any longer. As the storyline progresses, our couple finally realize that the other one is the one who has always owned their heart but Julie will soon discover that Tommy is quick to forget about everything when his star, once again, begins to shine.

Abby Niles pulls the reader into a storyline about two people who have been friends for as long as they can remember but taking the relationship from friends to lovers is something they have both wanted to do for a very long time but neither one is willing to admit the truth. The reader follows as two people struggle with the push and pull of sexual attraction and the ensuing heat but watch as the friendship will falter when a familiar pattern re-emerges and forces one or both to walk away.

FIGHTING LOVE is a romantic, contemporary storyline where two people who have known each for twenty three years still have issues with trust, relationships and emotional growth as it pertains to one other. The progression from friends to something more is slow and hindered by Tommy's inability to commit and Julie's inability to trust. Tommy has always considered himself the protector and Julie needs protecting from the man himself. My only critique is the continuous reminder, throughout the story, about how long our couple has been friends.

If you are a fan of the MMA storyline premise, with a battered hero and a heroine who loves the hero for all of his faults, Fighting Love is the perfect romantic storyline-a little bit of heartbreak; a little bit of love and whole lot of anxious moments before our couple finally realize that two best friends can be lovers at the end of the day.",3,"[-2.6906177360456125, -1.776254114841575, -1.0585369003429603, -0.9992757899249568, -1.1903534595478622]",-0.9992757899249568

To say her life is busy is an understatement.  She is taking a break and having a sandwich at Tugboat Slims when a man falls on top of her after being shot.  She is surprised to recognize him as Gilbert Goodsen, a supporter of the Foundation who is also vying for the a seat on the board.  The other candidate is his soon to be ex-wife, Jamie.  When Gilbert asks Elli for her help in find his missing Faberge egg which he believes Jamie has since she was the only person who knew he had it.  She reluctantly agrees because she feels he is not telling her everything.  As she searches for answers danger begins to surround her.  Only one of the Goodsens will survive to take the board position.

The word that I would use for Parker Grant is a British term, Cheeky! She might be disabled, but she isn't going to put up with being treated that way. Of course, being a teen novel, romance gets in the way. Scott - the guy who let her down. Scott - the guy who was never going to get a second chance.

2293,"Take an aging, vulnerable woman who lives alone in an isolated environment.  Add in a less than savory caregiver who gives copious hints that she is not everything she says she is.  It's a formula that has been used by Tatjana Soli in The Forgetting Tree and the Finnish author Tove Jansson in The Unwanted Guest... among others.  Fiona McFarlane revisits it in The Night Guest and places her own spin on it.  And the great thing is - it works, exceedingly well.

The two key characters are Ruth Field, a woman who lives alone in an Australian seaside home after the death of her husband, often commanding up memories of her Fijian childhood, her two sons who live far away, and her first love, a man named Richard.  Into this lonely world comes Frida Young, who claims to be sent by the government as a caregiver.

Yet right from the start, the reader senses that something is off.  Frida doesn't exactly act like a typical caregiver.  Ruth seems...well, some of her actions are called into question.  And the dynamics between the two women smack of a certain sadomasochism.  And then there's the question of the tiger, that Ruth swears enters her parlor at night, and which Frida appears to buy into.  What is true and what is false?  What can the reader believe?

In Fiona McFarlane's capable hands, all this is quite believable.  The writing is assured, confident, hypnotic and suspenseful...and often luscious with detail.  The psychological underpinnings are subtlely rendered and the denouement is authentic and organic.  And the themes are universal: aging and the loss of independence, trust tempered with fear, memory and reality.

Ruth - an ordinary yet extraordinary older woman - comes across as fully-realized;  she is overly considerate, her back hurts, she doesn't want to give up her car, she still has that spark of life, she is able to laugh at herself.  Frida is appropriately menacing and yet...in a strange way, seems to genuinely care about Ruth.  This is a fine debut and portends good things for this young author.

Bosch remains the same - angry, bitter, and with an enormous sense of duty -, yet Connelly, a very skillfull and resourceful author, is able to complement and further develop his main character based on hints he scattered in the previous books.

This time Bosch, suspended from his activities, will devote his spare time to investigate a murder that has haunted him for the past thirty years: the murder of his own mother. Connelly is able to weave a plot that began forty years earlier, involving prostitution, politics and struggle for power, and at the same time we, the readers, are able to get to know Bosch a little more: what was his infancy like, and what drives him today.

""The last coyote"" is the best book so far in the Harry Bosch series. Connelly has improved - not quite overcome, but surely improved - his ""final twist"" problem, giving the story more authenticity, and the plot is surely great.

For those who think that ""detective stories"" are a lesser kind of literature, I always recommend Michael Connelly and Dennis Lehane. They are great authors, with excellent characters and their books present settings (Los Angeles and Boston, respectivelly) that feel real to the reader. No make-up, just the real deal.

The misunderstood genius (Jason) devotes his life to both understanding and conquering the so-called ""Spin"".  His twin sister, Diane, follows a millenial cult, embracing religion in word if not in spirit. Tyler, our narrator, falls in love with Diane at age 10 and that love never wanes through all manner of trial and tribulation.

The writing is alternatively serious, tender, intelligent and almost lyrcial as it explores humanity asking how we would react if we knew that our species would soon end.  The novel idea of terraforming Mars & having humans attempt a solution in the next few hundred thousand years (one day on Earth) was ingenius. The conclusion is bitter sweet, majestic - almost glorious - as it tantlizes, saddens and satisfies the reader.

9331,"When we first saw George Smiley in The Spy Who Came Out of the Cold, he was just a midlevel operative.  Years have past, George (Alec Guiness) has moved up the ladder at the Circus and been forced to retire.

Now the Circus has a mole.  Operation Testify is initiated to identify the mole.  Jim Prideaux (Ian Bannen) is sent to Czechoslovakia to meet with a highly placed Russian agent, Code Name Testify. Control gives each of the presumed spies are given a name based on the child's rhyme Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Sailor, Richman, Poorman, Beggerman, Theif.  When the operation is compromised, then a shakeup happens at the Circus and George is out in the cold.

When a new information super highway, Merlin, is about to happen Control enlists George to find the mole.

The following are the suspects:

Tinker - Percy Alleline (Michael Aldridge), the new head of the Circus.

Tailor - Bill Haydon (Ian Richardson), new head of the London branch

Soldier - Roy Bland (Terence Rigby), a high level operative

Poorman - Toby Esterhase (Bernard Hepton), head of the Lamplighters - internal security force

Beggerman - George Smiley, no longer a suspect

To determine the mole, George must unearth secrets from the past.  Some of which are better buried.

This is the best spy movie ever, It is complex but not to the point you can't follow.  The performances are superb.  Alec Guiness shows why he is considered one of the greatest actors ever.

9571,"I first saw Scott&Bailey on our PBS station, this is a television series from England, and I liked the rapport between the two female detectives. Janet Scott played by Lesley Sharp and Rachel Bailey played by Suranne Jones. The series started in 2011, but I saw the first series in 2014.

The two detectives and their female, DCI, Gill Murray played by Amelia Bullmore are clever and the scripts they are given are intelligent and witty. The detectives are friends, and their personal and private lives take a big part of this series. The cases they garner are tough and take a lot of hard work and time. The male detectives treat them as equals, which is a new and wonderful experience.

Rachel Bailey is intelligent but chaos seems to follow her. In her 30's, she drinks too much and takes risks, her brother moves in with her. He has a criminal record and Bailey's DCI would not be happy to know this. Janet Scott is older, with two daughters, and a husband who is boring, and it seems separation is the name of the game. There's a lot of conversation and red wine, some teasing, and some very serious issues discussed. This is television at its best. I found myself rooting for the detectives to get their personal problems and work related issues solved. They are attractive women but not beautiful. They sometimes turn up at work not looking their best, but that is real life, isn't it?

In season 2, the cases are tougher, much of the time it is a woman as the victim. Scott and Bailey work as a team most of the time, but they have their differences. Their private lives at this time involve men and drinking, and, as been stated Rachel Bailey is a binge drinker, often showing up at work with a hangover. The male detectives they work with are supportive, but can be found teasing with male jokes. They all work well together, and everyone will do whatever it takes not to be called into DCI Gill Murray'S office. Didcipline and excellent police work is the word if the day- good series.

""Wonder""
By R. J. Palacio
(Knopf, 2012)
-----------------------------------------
This is a deeply compelling page-turner about a ten-year old boy named August (""Auggie"") Pullman who is a sweet, compelling narrator, but whose external life is marred by the intense negative reactions that strangers have when they see his face: Auggie was born the victim of multiple genetic disorders which combined and intertwined to malform his face from birth onwards. The book opens with his decision to enroll in a regular school after years of homeschooling -- he's going straight into junior high, with all its petty cruelties and emotional upheavals. The story is told from Auggie's point of view, as well as other characters such as his sister and various kids at his school. The countless humiliations and slights, intentional or otherwise, that bound Auggie's life are balanced by the depth of his character and that of the people around him...

Many readers, including parents of disabled children, and the children themselves, as well as students and educators, will find a lot to celebrate here. The subtlety, nuance and humanity of this book is tremendous; it is a story packed with humor, insight, moral power and a strong, healthy dose of pure empathy and human kindness. If you saw Auggie walking on the street, chances are you might look away -- as do many in this book -- but after reading this story, you'll wish you could spend more time with him. I know I did. Great story, highly recommended.

This is book 2 of the Moroad Motorcycle Club series and like book 1, it will not disappoint. I couldn't wait to dive into this book. I love the world that Cam and Christina live in. And like book 1, its just as much as a mind f#@&.

This book begins 18 months after book 1 left off. Cam is once again a free man and struggles to find his way back into his club and his womans life. Right away he notices changes in his world, changes he doesnt like, and changes he has no control over. Christina was left on her own for 18 months. The only contact she had with Cam was through letters. She missed him and wanted him back but could they be as they were before? She struggles with her place in his world while he struggles to keep her in his world. He is determined to keep her safe and his club thriving and will do whatever it takes to make both happen.

This book was hot and oh, so good. We see a different side to Cam in this book. He isn't as closed off. We see him grow and finally he lets Christina not only in his world but in his heart as well.  I loved seeing them both grow and develop. We see Jeremy come into his own and struggle with being part of a club and what being a member means.

386,"The Drowning Game is a standalone suspense/thriller written by debut author LS Hawker. I absolutely love kick@ss heroines, and the main character Petty has been training since the age of three to kick some serious @ss. This girl is a one-woman militia in the making, but not because she necessarily wants to be...she truly doesn't know that life can be any different. Petty's upbringing brings strange and dysfunctional to a whole other level!

In addition to all her inherent bad@ssery, Petty is also fragile, uncertain, questioning, lonely, understandably paranoid, and a hopeless dreamer. I loved her character! The contrast between her core innocence and deadly capabilities made her an interesting character to follow. The first half of this novel was on point as Petty's isolated world was built, the villains and side characters were introduced, and the thriller/suspense/mystery element started to come to life. There did come a point later on in the story when things began to feel a bit one-dimensional in my opinion, but the stress of the events kept me turning the pages without regret.

Overall, I liked The Drowning Game and I loved that all my questions were addressed by the end. Ms. Hawker definitely has a lot of imagination and I am excited to see what else this first-time author has up her sleeve. If you enjoy the genres noted for this novel, then consider checking it out!

My favorite quote:
I learned early not to praise the beauty I saw around me. Dad liked to show me how the pretty surface of things in this world always hid ugliness. For instance, the Star of Bethlehem flowers that grow like crazy by the side of the road are poisonous. And those oak trees. In the summertime they're robed in hundreds of succulent, transparent-green leaves that clap politely in the breezes like spectators at a golf match. In the fall they turn Creamsicle orange with brilliant red edges.

Joan Didion and her husband, the well-known writer, John Gregory Dunne, were given a beautiful baby girl in a private adoption almost the minute she was born,and promptly named her Quintana Roo, a name they had seen on a map when they were in Mexico. Quintana, a precocious child and dearly loved, grew up and married a nice young man, as her parents wished her health and happiness and many beautiful children. But sadly it was not to be. Quintana died seven years later leaving her mother, a recent widow, grief-stricken and bereft, and wondering, always wondering, if she had done right by her child.

Were there cues she had missed, could she have handled things differently, in the last analysis did she fail as a parent? Ms. Didion takes us through her daughter's childhood and young adulthood in California and later in New York, and examines her own role in Quintana's life--as well as the worry and anxiety she feels about illness and growing old.

While Finn has no idea that the ghost of Kennis grandpa is helping her with the case, he is suspicious when she appears to have conversations with herself and acts on clues that seem to come out of thin air.

And this went by quickly. You meet Carl and Dill, members of the Assessment team for Zombie Inc. It's 30  years post apocalypse, and the government is now synonymous with Zombie Inc. ZI keeps the world safe,for at least the 5 state republic, by coming up with defense mechanisms only the rich can afford. They employ almost everyone, with 7 day work weeks, no time off, and time docked for mandatory meetings. They even keep people from marrying so there will be no heirs to inherit benefits.

6534,"Under Her by Samantha Towle is a fun enemies to lovers romance that will have readers developing a serious addiction for this couple.

Wilder...what can I say about this hero? He really is kind of a jerk, completely arrogant, 100% playboy material, and on some level immature. Samantha Towle, however, with the use of 1st person point-of-view, somehow makes him likable. His inner-dialogue had me laughing, and there is a level of humility that shines at just the right time to make him endearing.  Wilder really shouldn't be a hero to love but he is.

Morgan is an amazing heroine for so many reasons, but what drew me to her particularly is her tenacity. She has worked for everything in her life, and she is smart and fierce in the business world. What readers will really enjoy is that she doesn't get hung up on the past. She has moved on, grown up, and left it behind, but she hasn't forgotten it. Independence and intelligence are key factors for me when it comes to a heroine, and Morgan has these two attributes in spades.

Under Her falls into the hate to love plot structure, with their antagonistic relationship stemming from their interactions in college. The hate mixed with the palpable sexual tension between the two makes for an incredibly well paced relationship. Readers get to see the hate transform into something else in a natural way. The conflict, however, came a little late in the story for me, and the quick resolution gave me a bit of whiplash. Although, I wasn't expecting the conflict, I did expect who/what would cause the conflict to occur.

9716,"We have one of the common dog problems: four small poodles who go berserk anytime a doorbell rings or a guest enters the house. And while they've done a good job of teaching each other this behavior, our efforts to use the normal methods of breaking the behavior have been ineffective.

One method which seemed to me to have great potential was to use a water squirt gun to squirt the dogs in the face to curb the barking. While that did have some positive effect, our youngest dog simply learned that when we pick up a squirt gun he should run to cover to continue his barking. LOL Then the other dogs join back in.

This device has made immediate progress. One short tap on the button gets their attention and stops the barking immediately. I'm then able to call them to me, give them a treat for performing ""come"", and hold their attention.

I did quite a bit of reading about using devices like this before I decided to get one and try it out. I think that the most important tips were (a) to not overuse it and (b) to use it in combination with other interaction and a reward for positive behavior.

If you are having a problem behavior which this might help, I suggest trying it. Others have not had any success using this device at all. If you try it and don't have success Amazon will let you return it.

Your best chance of success is to do some reading about other training methods which may correct the problem behavior and use those in combination with this device. The usefulness of this device is to interrupt the behavior and get the dog's attention, then use that opportunity to build better habits. It should NOT be used as a punishment for the problem behavior.

1515,"Sweet, gentle love story taking place in the 1880s of two damaged souls finding love and healing in each other.

Heroine Melissa grew up poor and put upon by father and brothers, who used her as a servant and general punching bag.  To escape them, she married a man who ended up to be no better.  He took her away from Portland to the Yukon to strike it rich but the only thing he ended up striking was Melissa.  Now he wants to sell Melissa and their baby daughter to pay off his debts.  Trading store owner Dylan Harper accepts them in payment for the debts, only because he fears for their safety.

So he takes in Melissa and baby, she cooks and keeps house for him and they sleep in the only bed with a huge sack of rice in the center, since it's to be a business transaction, not a real marriage.  Well, the only conflicts in the story are 1) Melissa feels the need to repay all her husband's debts;  2) Melissa believes that all men are unkind and untrustworthy;  3) Dylan doesn't trust women after being betrayed by the woman he had loved back home; and 4) Both characters hesitate to confess their growing love for each other, until it may be too late.

As you can see, there's nothing new here in the way of plot and what there is of story develops very slowly.  It is a sweet and gentle fall into love but was rather dull and bland, in spite of the fact that the characters were fine people.  But too much internal musing and too little action make for a boring read.

There are some interesting descriptions of life in a gold-rush town but not enough to turn this into a full-length book rather than a novella.

9430,"This movie sets up the second Resident Evil trilogy, and takes place sometime after the events of Afterlife, in which Alice finds her other clones.  It marks the return of Paul W.S. Anderson to the director role, having written all the movies, but directed just the first.  It starts out with Alice attacking the Tokyo umbrella facility, trying to take down Albert Wesker, who was shown basically as a hologram in the third movie.  She ends up losing her powers and then ends up trying to evade another zombie horde while holed up in a prison and find Arcadia and the refugees she sent off during the events of Afterlife.

I will not say more about the plot, because to do so would spoil too much.  The film brings back the character of Claire Redfield played by Ali Larter, and also introduces the character of her brother Chris, played by Wentworth Miller.  They are holed up with a new group of refugees, most notably the character Luther West, played by Boris Kodjoe.  The climax of the film basically involves trying to take down Wesker, as well as a rescue.

For those who get the blu-ray, the movie looks and sounds great like the others.  I have the regular version, so I cannot tell you how the 3d version is, but it is much like the other films have been in 2d.  There are deleted scenes, outtakes, multiple commentary tracks on the movie, and several behind the scenes and making of features.  Good for what is there.  By now everyone knows what the movies are and are not.  Most likely, if you have liked the other movies, you will still like this one, although you have to be okay with it moving farther from the kind of basic zombie movies that parts 1 and 2 were and having ever evolving threats.

That is the true mark of the hero the government needs, the hero they need Ender to become.

As tensions get higher at the Battle School, and Ender becomes a bigger target, he feels more alone and isolated then ever before.  He wonders if he is becoming as cruel as his brother, the one person he hopes never to be like.  The pressure of the Battle School continues to get tougher as the teachers push Ender to his limits.  Will Ender break, or will he become the general that is needed to save Earth?

What an intriguing book.  I typically don't enjoy war room game books, but this one kept me interested.  The strategies involved in the various games were great and the manipulations, though extreme, seemed to fit to hone their soldiers and form them into what was needed to defeat the enemy.

I look forward to seeing if those are delved into more deeply in the rest of the quartet.

As the ""idiot"" brother Ned of the title, Rudd infiltrates the lives of his three sisters, each successful by her own definition: Natalie (Zooey Deschanel), the pansexual lesbian-ish sister in a loving monogamous relationship with Cindy (masterfully played by Rashida Jones); Liz (Emily Mortimer), the hyper-conscious and sensitive Mom committed to raising self-actualized kids; and Miranda (Elizabeth Banks, who bears a very spooky resemblance to Parker Posey in this film), the cutthroat journalist who writes for Vanity Fair. By sheer virtue of his almost child-like honesty, Ned manages to learn secrets about each one of his sisters--secrets that, once revealed, have very amusing but also very profound consequences. The script is intelligent, the performances are superb all around (including Adam Scott, T.J.

Both of them on the same SWAT team, Clay is bi and Logan is a Dom... I didn't think I would like that, I'm not big into the whole BDSM thing, but this was more than just that.
Logan had been watching Clay for a while, knowing he had feelings for him but didn't think he was ready to be in the kind of relationship he needed, it wasn't until Clay made the first move that Logan gave in and wanted a shot at being with Clay. He didn't want just a night with him or just a hookup, he wanted everything from Clay.
And Clay, not one for relationships, or long term ones anyway, didn't know he felt about being dominated, he had a lot of mixed feelings about it that caused some problems along the way. I understood where he was coming from and the reasons he had reservations about that kind of relationship.
I really liked the dynamic between Clay and Tiffany, and Carlos and Logan, it was nice that they had another couple to talk about things when they needed to, I felt like Tiffany helped Clay out a lot and even Los did when it was his time.....

What I didn't like... was the way Clay was a little bratty after he goes to Logan after he's already told him they wouldn't be together.

966,"""Seabiscuit"" is a lyrical tale broken into three parts.  In the first part Laura Hillenbrand introduces us to the four individuals who will comprise Team Seabiscuit.  There's Charles Howard, the winning salesman who upon the death of his beloved child loses his passion for cars (his son was killed in a car crash) and discovers a passion for horses, and in so doing brings his competitive showmanship to horse racing.  There's Red Pollard who grew up in terrible poverty just as Charles Howard grew up in terrible wealth; his family ravaged by the Great Depression, Red Pollard decides to ravage his body in order to become a jockey and prizefighter, and he brought to horse-racing a maniacal obsession with the sport and deep sensitivity to the marginalized.  Then there's Tom Smith, the original horse whisperer, who was born a century too late, and as his home -- the plains and hills of the Western frontier -- receded he retreated to the only skill he could market to a modern world that no longer had time and patience for his sort of time and patience with life.  Finally, there's the rascally, lazy, and profoundly talented Seabiscuit, who had the speed and the gameness to win it all all along, but who went misunderstood until Howard, Pollard, and Smith found him.

In the second part, we read about Seabiscuit's anti-climactic ego-driven rivalry with War Admiral.  It's the final and third part that makes this book such a lyrical and memorable read.  Severely hampered by age and injuries, Red Pollard and Seabiscuit make one final bid for the Santa Anita Handicap, the richest prize in all of horse-racing and the race that they should have won but lost twice before.  And it's this last part that's non-fiction storytelling at its best.",3,"[-2.895742085623275, -1.3126509080195974, -1.1391491175642225, -1.0020822042390987, -1.3338187735422549]",-1.0020822042390987

That was really the last movie he was in where he was the main star (even though in that and Made Vince Vaughn really stole the movies). After seeing this I wouldn't be surprised if he got more starring roles. He is perfect for this movie. He really just plays Mike, grown up, with a little more confidence. That is not a bad thing at all. The movie is full of comedy, heart and is so entertaining and enjoyable to watch that the movie moves along almost too fast and you wish there was more.

1757,"First Kiss is not exactly what I expected, there was a time where I think the characters are way too young, or the story dragged. But the ending was pretty unexpected.

Nevertheless, I love these kids! Yes! They were young, especially Alyssa. Jake and she grew up together and have been friends and neighbors since they were young. Their lives drifted apart somewhere along the way, Jake was busy with forming a band and becoming famous, while Alyssa was focused on her friends and her sports, volleyball. Their paths once again crossed when Summer began, and unexpectedly - chemistry sparked.

Since she was young, and they both knew Alyssa's parents would most likely not allow their daughter to get involve with him, they kept their relationship a secret. Most often, she would sneak up to his room and spend some time there. It was weird and I totally understand Alyssa's older sister why she was opposed to the two - her sister was very young, nave and doesn't have any experience with boys, while Jake who's 18 has been with girls, have done drugs and booze. How can they carry on a relationship? Will Alyssa get out of it unscathed when Jake no longer wanted her?

The dual-POV was a blessing. I always loved getting into the brains of the characters, and not second-guessing them. I liked Jake - he was a gentleman, and did not force Alyssa to do anything that she wasn't ready for. You may wonder why of all people, he fell for someone way younger. There were a lot of girls, but why Alyssa? Well, she's the only remaining NORMAL in his life. She makes him feel loved and everything about the two of them just feels real.  BUT of course, I would have preferred if he waited for her to grow up a little more.

I never expected the novel to be that long. It was more than what I expected. Nevertheless, it was amazing how the author was able to manage to compress almost ALL teenage issues into one book. And what I love more about this novel are the songs!!! It wasn't just the tunes or the melody, but the lyrics were pretty great as well!

Now, all we have to do is be patient, sit back and wait for the sequel.

I'm 6'4"" and it easily accommodates my entire length. It is very nicely stitched around the edges with a thick, soft, yarn-like thread. The pattern is a pleasing, neutral design that will go with nearly every decor. The material has a ribbed, piping-like texture to it that increases its pliability while adding a modicum of insulating ability.

2251,"Wow ... great 5-star reviews have already been tendered. I can't disagree with them. My addition to the reviews asks just one question ... Who was this man!? That might seem a peculiar question after reading a biography as grand as White's but it is nonetheless the question that I've considered these several days.

I'm not sure there's an answer that can be revealed in biography. Who is a comparable benchmark in history? From the humble stock to warrior President, this man overcame challenges like no other ... not Washington, not Churchill. How did such genius of action arise from such humble origins? Any numbers of men were equally or more suited then Lincoln in his time and place. Others were certainly easier on the eyes as evidenced in the many daguerreotypes that White reproduces.

White delivers a thoroughly enjoyable biography on all the pertinent levels in a single book format. White does not explore the modern hypotheses regarding Lincoln's mental health, what about Mary?, sexual preferences, etc. as some may won't that he should. White provides an exquisite peek into A. Lincoln's oratorical skills and mastery of the word from Lincoln's perspective and the listener. Then he reveals the effects and the unrelenting pursuit of a national vision.

At the risk of sounding corny, there is a silver thread of the metaphysical weaving its way through White's Lincoln that White may or may not have noted from the details. There is a clarity, a closure in that Lincoln simply `left history' ... his job accomplished. Assassination was of course the reality but there is just so much more.

White's Lincoln must end as it did. Lincoln ran the good race and finished. White hits all the right chords to reveal an underlying unknowable. We shall not see the likes of A. Lincoln again.",3,"[-2.6475280938232535, -1.3856572895050814, -1.2278095757863916, -1.002242443729384, -1.1117301009147214]",-1.002242443729384

He's taken me to an island of a sequined love nun, a sleepy cove terrorized by a lusty lizard, even back in time to hang out with Jesus and his buddy Biff.

My daughter took a shine to this one immediately and was fascinated with how it changes colors, so much so that she took it to bed with her and drifted off to sleep with it tucked under her arm the first night we had it, and does so now almost every night.  The slow and steady color-changing is mesmerizing even for me, it's a nice bonus that she enjoys it as well and it helps her transition slowly into sleep mode and wind down from a busy day.

The light is very easy to charge by simply placing it on the charging base - you do have to make sure it is sitting securly in the base and make sure the base is completely level.  There is a light indicator on the front that lets you know if it's sitting securely and charging correctly.

The charge time seems to be plenty long for our purposes - the first night we used it lasted at least 8 hours.  Most nights after my daughter is asleep I will carefully slip the light from her bed and place it back in the base so she can use it again the next night.

1589,"History repeats itself at an estate high above the shores of Lake Garda, where a century ago, renowned playwright Galeazzo DAscanio wrote a drama, considered to be his masterpiece, expressly for his muse, actress Celia Sands. She disappeared without a trace on the eve of its opening, leaving him broken and bereft, and locals believe that she has haunted the estate ever since. Now his grandson, Alessandro, has endowed the property to a historic trust, and as a final tribute to Galeazzo, he plans to stage the play for the public before relinquishing the villa. For the leading lady, he has engaged a fledgling English actress, another Celia Sands, who with trepidation accepts the role and travels to Italy for rehearsals. At the villa, she is assigned the very same room once occupied by her namesake, whose portrait hangs above the bedstead. Celias nervousness about taking on her first starring role is exacerbated by tales about ghostly encounters, and the fact that two household staff members are missing adds to her uneasiness. When some unsettling incidents occur, she tries to chalk them up to imagination.

Season of Storms unfolds at a leisurely pace. Its clear from the outset that events from the past will be mirrored in the present, so the book relies on characters and the process of staging a play as its center. Character development is uneven, however, and its unfortunate that Celia remains a reactor, passive and unsophisticated. Although she will come to feel real fear, the reader never does. Part mystery and part romance, both story lines fall a bit flat in spite of the spectacular Gothic setting in which they play out. What works somewhat better is the gradual reveal around modern Celias own family history, which is cleverly plotted and does come as a surprise

Shes been in town for 2 years now and Travis has had an eye on her since the beginning but has never made a move. He has rules and they are stifling, but one by one he breaks the rules because he cant deny himself anymore. Elaine has been trying hard to get ahead and her past is one she wants to forget and move forward but when the two get close while hes running for Sherrif her past may come to haunt both of them and hinder his chances.
What a read of not only some steamy scenes but they were sensual to top it off with the intimacy they shared but not only that I loved how they have known each other for two years so when they fall in love its not insta anything which makes it all that much more when they use the word love. Travis is a good man with a good heart not resorting to underhanded tactics and trying to win on his own merit but not only that he treats Dax like his own, a man you would want in your corner if needed. Elaine is amazing, with everything she went through but stuck it out because of her son when she could have easily went any other way instead of becoming a hard working, selfless, kind woman that she is.
An amazing great read and now I cant wait to read about the others and of course reading about Colton, the long lost brother of Travis who finally returns home.

Nightmare Before Christmas is a wonderful story written by Tim Burton where misinterpretations and errors lead to admirable traits such as courage, forgiveness, and love.  However, the story is told in a macabre environment where characteristics are most often forgotten.

1038,"Jonasson is one of my new favorite authors. His story-telling style is one of a kind. His humor is impeccable. His collage of characters are unusual, dodgy, odd, weird, utterly unpredictable and yet somewhat endearing. The story of 100-year-old man who climbed out the window and disappeared, which could have used a punchier title between us, sticks with you. It's not a feel-good novel so much as it's a funny satire of key parts of world history retold through the eyes of Alan Karlsson, who happens to get involved in it all rather innocently. The book is told in flashbacks - the present time where we follow Alan out of that window and into his new series of adventures, one funnier than the other - and the past starting with Alan's childhood and building up to the present time.
I loved this book. I loved Alan's accounts of having met up and worked for Stalin, Churchill, Truman, General Franco (whoever he was!?!), and so many other notables the funniest of which is Herbert Einstein, the half-brother of Albert Einstein, and Albert's happy-go-lucky approach to all things in life. It really is something of a shock when you meet Alan at 99 years of age and this may be a spoiler but I have to say it, so consider that your warning, when the fox kills the cat and he gets angry for the first time in his life, at 99 years of age did I mention? And soon, within a few hours, realizing that while his mood is driven by revenge until the fox (and much else) gets properly blown up, that revenge isn't really all that great a thing to live for.

If you're looking for historical fiction that'll take you to a certain place and time without needing an excess of words to get there, News of the World will satisfy.

We meet Pamela in the initial books of the ""Rylee Adamson"" Series as a ""broken"" teenager betrayed by those who should have protected and loved her, but who also is the source of an ultimate power... we travel with her as she faces obstacles no teenager should be challenged with and watch as she becomes increasingly independent seeking her own identity and an understanding of her abilities... In this epilogue, we watch Pamela detach from her pack and place her trust in an unlikely source... This leads her down a path to facing her painful past, making decisions that can have disastrous consequences; and ultimately connecting with and understanding the depth of her power... I enjoyed learning more about Pamela and watching her grow and strengthen in her developing character; her tenacity, compassion, and willpower shine through as she learns to trust herself and become the powerful witch she was always intended to be:)",3,"[-2.552722474120219, -2.533779383909383, -1.1557140349212394, -1.0028680667263026, -1.229516052735616]",-1.0028680667263026

If you like thrillers, spy-movies, plots that you have to follow to find out where you've been and where you are going, this is the movie for you.

Recommend it highly.  We have always enjoyed movies that Liam Neeson is starring in.  He is really a good actor.  I liked the previous one that he starred in where he goes after his kidnapped daughter. That was intense as well.

I hope he will venture into other areas like romance, drama, etc.  He will do well in anything he tries.",3,"[-4.454064302863812, -2.39431512204813, -1.3120044626762586, -1.0029002875562363, -1.1111830960121547]",-1.0029002875562363

He has hired Jill Hale to help him convince the city council and others that this is a viable construction and back it.
Peggy McBride is totally against gambling of any type and sets out to investigate Mac and find something to help stop the resort.  She is determined not to like Mac at all.

9727,"I bought this for my cats several years ago.  I keep it stashed away on top of a shelf and bring it out every now and then.  I will say that it works, even after prolonged storage.  The batteries seem to have a long lifetime.  It's also fairly well-constructed, as my cats haven't yet been able to tear it apart.

All the pieces were in my package and assembly was quick and easy.  The feather bounced around as advertised.  I'm not sure how sturdy this is going to be for a large cat, since the supportive feet are a little bit flimsy and tend not to stay in place all that well.  It's also a little bit noisy, so you wouldn't want to leave it on for a long time if you were going to be in the room.

Unfortunately, my cats (I have four of them, with different personalities and toy preferences) aren't all that interested in this, although the youngest two (now 6 and 7) enjoyed it when they were under a year old.  So maybe it's better for kittens?  At least, that's been my experience.  (My cats do greatly enjoy a feather on a long stick, so it's not that they don't like feather toys or dangly toys.  Maybe they're not thrilled by the sound of the motor?)

With cat products, as always, your mileage may vary.  Cats are quite individual in their preferences and what works for one may not work for others.  Except for the supportive feet moving some, I felt like this was put together well, although it may best be suited for kittens or smaller cats.",3,"[-2.6993195443962295, -1.622227966937519, -1.1104669319739833, -1.003248102975098, -1.216536223836331]",-1.003248102975098

There are so many characters, so many plots, so many intricacies and of course Dickens' writing style that it all combines to make a formidable read.

2745,"A poignant, debut novel  a winner out of the gate, filled with careful description and woven skillfully! A vivid, engaging first book with strong characters, dramatic storytelling, which should establish Julie Kibler as a strong novelist. She most definitely possesses a gift of telling a tragic story, in an entertaining way with an inspiring takeaway of friendship and love. (She has just been added to my favorite author list, and so look forward to following this author)!

A complex and compelling portrait of the painful intricacies of love, loyalty, discrimination, and racial tensions. An insightful story of two women caught between their hearts, families, and their future.

Calling Me Home is no ordinary love story; however, a book of astonishing precision from past to present, from one younger black woman and an older white woman; raw, painful, beautiful feelings told in honesty, unfolding precisely and eloquently, during this long road trip between friends of two different eras and color.

The real magic of the book was the subject matter of two families (black/white) trying to survive in an era in which men and women found themselves bound by strict constraints, dictated by society and ignorance. A heart felt story and forbidden love of two people fighting for a life they so deserve  a fearless, heart wrenching story about the power of true love and friendship.

There was much depth and power to this relationship between Robert/Isabelle; a timeless love derailed by others, secrets, and an era which did not accept this sort of relationship between a man and woman. A complex tapestry of lives intertwined, a compassionate story of those who are destroyed by love by secrets and betrayal.

There is warmth and love, even with such painful subjects, as the bond these two women share, not bound by blood, but by a friendship which changes Dotties life and her future, is remarkable  a portrait of resilience told with clarity and painful precision, probing the dark history of Isabelles past with a few surprises readers will love before it ends, making you smile.

An emotionally charged, absorbing novel about friends, lovers, secrets, and families. Kiblers sensitive and gripping examination of a familys past is engaging from the beginning and gets better with every chapter, with unforgettable characters. Eloquently told and making it more special, the authors insight into the subject matter from her familys history. A powerful and memorable story you will not soon forget.

This story was a story about two people that once had a connection many years ago, but now find themselves on two very different sides of a camera.  Laine is the Shuttergirl, Michael is the star.  He is always finding himself on the other side of the paparazzi lens, but what happens when the stalker behind the trees becomes the stalked?  When two old friends, connect through a camera will old feelings spark?

Laine Cartwright didn't have a good life.  She grew up in foster care and always felt like she was the one on the outside and even now, she is the one still standing on the outside trying to look in while the shutter clicks.  Michael Greydon is a swoony, sexy, nice guy in a sea of Hollywood sharks and I really did fall for him.  How can you not?

Laine was only fifteen, Michael was eighteen when they met.  Now years later you get to see how each has grown.  A second chance love story set in Hollywood.  You get the glam, the flash and all that comes with being in Hollywood and under the spotlight.

1721,"I received this ebook free from the author in return for an honest review. The first third of the book was very slow while the author introduced the characters. The main character is Kate Seaver, who is present at her father's death from a gunshot wound. He emerged from a house with a gunshot wound in his chest and tells his daughter:""He shot me.""
She is dismayed when the police and coroner declare it a suicide and sets out to prove he was murdered by James Rayburn. The rest of the book shows how she finds out the truth and also how the civil war affects her and her family. The book starts in Nashville, Tennessee in 1860 and ends in 1862 after the Union army has captured Nashville.

The author did quite a bit of research into how people lived their lives during this period, using such words as ""sockdolager"" and ""snood"".
I found snood in the kindle dictionary but had to ask the author what sockdolager meant--a forceful blow.

There are some laugh out lines early on in the book when she is called to a wake and the corpse is still alive.

Maggie was the wholesome good girl who was drop dead gorgeous but had no clue. She had been hurt by any man she came on contact with. She stayed late at work and never complained.

Benjamin was a workaholic. He felt guilty for being out partying when his dad died. He felt that he had to make it up to his dead father by working and not doing anything in life that would bring him joy. His employees nicknamed him Beast. He had the hots for Maggie from her very first day on the job, but would never dream of acting on that impulse.

One day while staying late on a Friday night per their usual, everything changed. His mother walked in on an innocent dinner they were having and Maggie just happened to be on her knees under Benjamin's desk, picking up her fork. They were placed in a tough spot. Benjamin's mom was letting him have it about interoffice relationships when Maggie spoke up claiming to be his fiance to save both of their jobs. What will come of this fake engagement?

Charlie St. Cloud recovered from the auto wreck--in the car he'd 'borrowed,' brought back to life by paramedics. His younger brother, Sam, though, died. And Charlie finds himself unable to move on, living his life in the graveyard where he buried his brother. When beautiful sailor Tess Carroll shows up in his graveyard, confused by her recent accident and still grieving for her father's death, Charlie feels an attraction stronger than any he's experienced before. But he knows that he can't enter into a relationship. His promise to stay with Sam comforts Charlie, but it also limits him. Still, there is something about Tess that's important, and that Charlie needs to understand.
THE DEATH AND LIFE OF CHARLIE ST. CLOUD is about life, death, and moving on. Because Sam's death--and Charlie's promise--gave Charlie the gift of seeing spirits of the recently dead as they work their way to the future. But the gift and the promise hold both Sam and Charlie in a curious halfway world between life and the promise of an afterlife.

Khan had to leave with his brothers to fight in the war and Bailey thought he just left her. Khan had no choice but Bailey did not know that. They meet after they both sign up to a dating site. Bailey has a secret and Khan is about to find out that sometimes life gives you a second chance. Thank you to Kim Fox for the amazing review copy, I loved it. Can't wait for Alexander to have his story.

This story goes into a bit more detail, in certain bits, than one would find in the original stories.  However, in most cases these ""interventions"" make for a more enjoyable read and explain some of the things left unsaid in the stories by DLS.
The detection portions are very good and indicate how forensic examination is really beginning to have a significant impact on crime solving.

4771,I voluntarily reviewed an ARC of this book. This book was a fun read. Cam and Smith meet the day before she is to start work undercover at Calloway Corp. They share a hot and steamy night together. The next day Cam shows up for work and is assigned as Smith's new assistant. She sees this as a blessing in that she can figure out what is going on with the company so that she can submit a story to the paper she actually works for. Its a curse because this is Smith the man she is very attracted to and can not let on that she is there to investigate what is going on with the funds that seem to be missing from the company books. They try to keep their relationship professional yet with Calloway Sr trying to push Smith and Cam together it is very hard to stay that way. Cam and Smith finally give into each other. Neither expect what they find out as to who is embezzling from the company. As well Smith is very upset when he discovers that Cam is working there under false pretenses. He has fallen for Cam. Can he see past that? will they get their HEA? Read this great book and find out.

Problem is that, although I think Rachel was somewhat over with her ex, why does she keep running back to him when he come calling? This poses a problem between the two.

1798,"This well written history of the end of the late Bronze Age civilizations is part of the Turning Points in Ancient History series, but it can be read and enjoyed on its own without difficulty.  Eric H. Cline is an active archaeologist as well as a professor at Georgetown, and more importantly he is also an excellent writer, able to tell some colorful and amusing anecdotes and sprinkle  humorous asides and observations throughout his scholarship.

In the twelfth century B.C. the eastern Mediterranean world was enjoying a prolonged period of international contact, with goods being traded over a wide area of thriving civilizations, from Mycenae and Crete to Egypt up through Anatolia and into much of the rest of what is now known as the Middle East.  There was plenty of conflict between competing empires, but even battles and long military campaigns increased cross cultural trade and other contacts.  Then, beginning roughly around the year 1177 BC, a series of calamities brought these early examples of globalization to a halt.  There were numerous earthquakes, the climate changed in the form of a prolonged drought, resulting in increased unrest and migrations which led to the invasions of the so-called Sea Peoples, wars over resources became bitterer and more prolonged, and the Eastern Mediterranean entered a Dark Age.  Eventually new civilization centers arose, with new trade products and routes, and the old order was replaced with one from which Western civilization eventually was to develop.

Cline's experience and knowledge of archaeology led him to include many fascinating stories of discoveries, like buried cities and sunken Bronze Age sailing ships, which added color to his narrative.  He does a masterly job of examining different scenarios and analyzing their strengths and weaknesses, in the end explaining that the late Bronze Age came to an end from a general systems collapse due to interconnections which had become overly complex and delicate, so that one small disruption (as in the ""butterfly effect"") could eventually lead to a cascading series of disasters.  This, as Cline points out several times, is particularly pertinent information today as we make our way through the aftermath of a prolonged financial crisis.",3,"[-2.715028094232167, -1.700948965119419, -1.0145167109263367, -1.0054039888748754, -2.0251373628476808]",-1.0054039888748754

Other than just random cutting of little pieces of paper haphazardly she has had no practice cutting along lines, but with the very first page in this book she had no trouble at all.  She wanted to skip to some pages in the back of the book that were a little harder, so we tried some that had corners and curves - she got a little frustrated in a few spots but over all did remarkably well with a little encouragement.

The book is fantastic - the beginning pages start with simple straight very thick lines for them to cut along, and then it progresses to lines with angles and curves and the lines become thinner as you go along further into the book, so they can improve even more.  There are lots of fun, colorful pages and things for them to cut out and play with or decorate.

After seeing how much she has enjoyed this book I think we'll be picking up some of the other Kumon workbooks soon, and see if we can improve her letters and numbers.

This film has virtually every film noir attribute: a femme fatale, plot twists, crime, mischief, suspense, lots of smoking, and shadowy cinematography. In this film, the film noir aura slowly builds- it even gets progressively darker in asthetic and feel, which is pretty neat. It's sort of like dimming the lights in a room. The acting is superb, as Greer and Mitchum have chemistry, and a young Kirk Douglas does a fine job. Jane Greer is the ultimate femme fatale, with beauty, charm, but a very dark and corrupt side to her.  Out of the Past is essential to your film noir collection.

Their interactions are antagonistic, heated, and dripping in sexual tension...when they are not doing their best to ignore each other. They are the powder keg in their friend group just waiting to explode.

Their past both ties them together and puts up barriers. She hides her emotions and strives to be perfect all the time. She longs for safety and security. He is quiet, brooding, witty, intelligent, and intimidating to most. He is dangerous...at least to her heart. They try hard to keep each other at a distance, but both long for more and keep that hidden at least from each other. He is closed off from her. She's scared of more rejection and guards her heart. Everyone knows they belong together, but they are both clueless.

They tease, taunt, and drive each other nuts. He makes her feel alive, but also scares her senseless. He is obsessed with keeping her safe, but hates that she feels indebted to him. Their communication skills need a lot of work. Most of the time they end up fighting, insulting, or walking away from the other.

Both hate showing vulnerability and losing control. But it just takes on moment of true closeness to open up the floodgates. Even when they begin to give into temptation, they still have a lot of issues to wade through. Their past, their hidden feelings, regrets misunderstandings, fears, and outside influences are challenging to them.

They are volatile in every way--sometimes good, sometimes bad, always intense and entertaining.

I loved Archer and Elle together. Even during their denial, they were friends who acted like enemies, but would be there for the other no matter what. But acting on their attraction is only part of the problem, and they still have issues to face for a chance at more. And nothing is ever easy with these two. I was glad to get both of their points of view in order to see what was really going on in their heads.

Their whole friend group is quirky and fun. They've all had more of a clue about Elle and Archer throughout the series as their sexual tension and feelings were a poorly kept secret.

Natalia Puccini and Aiden McCann have a history together filled with young love and broken hearts.  Aiden grew up with a less than ideal upbringing.  His mother died when he was extremely young and his father lost himself to the bottle.  With little to no guidance, young Aiden became a bad boy.  The only one who believed in Aiden was a young Natalia.  Natalia had the perfect, ideal family with loving and supportive parents.  She thought her future was bright with Aidens love and working in her parents bakery.  But the future she envisioned wasn't meant to be.

Aiden left Red River, breaking Natalias heart, swearing he would never return.  Ten years later, his fathers illness brings him back to face the bad memories of the past and the one woman he could never forget.  Now, he has eight weeks to capture the heart of the only woman hes ever loved.

The Rebels Return is classic Victoria James.  This is a sweet romance that pulls at your heartstrings and if you didn't believe in love, turns you into a believer.  Aiden and Natalia have to overcome trust issues and feelings of unworthiness to claim the love they deserve and have been searching for.  The characters in this book are incredible.  I love the way the townspeople rally around each of them, never truly pushing, but dropping little subtle hints.

Cassanda Bainbridge is engaged to Geoffrey Giles, who ultimately becomes the Earl of Whittaker after the death of his brother. When Cassandra calls off her engagement due to an accident which causes her to have burns, she travels to the country where she focuses on her other love, ballooning. Even before her accident, she was more interested in reading about ballooning than doing the typical girl things, like sewing and attending a party. As could be imagined, her ex-fiancee Geoffrey would rather her keep her feet on the ground in order to stay safe.

Cassandra and Geoffrey were both characters I liked, although I think I liked Geoffrey more than the heroine. He really cared for Cassanda regardless of the scarring she experienced due to her accident. He was also a great boss with an interest in doing what was best for the factory workers. I read the first book in this series, but even if I had not read the book, I would have been able to follow the story of Cassandra and Geoffrey.

This is an awesome story full of secrecy, mystery and drama which starts at the beginning of the story until the very end. This story is about Michael Valente and Nikki Pastore and their history with an organized crime family. Michael was grieving about his father's horrible death who was a second in command of Victor Pastore crime family. He sacrificed his life to protect Victor and all that Mikey has was his mother. Now his mother has just died in a road accident, and this tragedy adds to his already broken heart. Victor Pastore, the crime boss enters into his life with an attempt to help him but with a price. After returning to New York to bury his mother, he see his childhood friend Nikki Pastore. Nikki the heroine and daughter of the mafia boss had a lives a fairly good life. The characters in this book are amazingly written, and the chemistry between Mikey and Nikki was unusual and unpredictable even if Victor is a selfish prick....The characters are very believable especially in their situations and their reactions to things as they are revealed.

MY THOUGHTS

I always enjoy Valerie Bowman stories. This one is no exception. Novellas or full lenghth novels she has never disappointed this reader.

This one is a novella and still has enough depth that it is truly enjoyable. Be prepared to finish it in one sitting. The characters are as usual, well developed. It does help to have read at least part of the previous books in this series as there are repeat characters involved.

I give this sweet, sexy novella a 4.75 stars!!

Billy (Jamie Bell) has recently lost his mother, and his family are struggling to survive, it is 1984 and the miners in Yorkshire are struggling against the disintegration of their way of life as a result of Margaret Thatcher's callous closure of British coal mines without providing any alternative livelihood or compensation for those dependent on the industry. Billy's father (Gary Lewis) and brother (Jamie Draven) are strongly involved in the miner's strike and the future of the family and community looks bleak. Billy's father scrapes together money to send him to boxing classes, but he doesn't enjoy them and being captivated by the girl's ballet dances he transfers to the latter, while concealing this from his family.
But his dance teacher, the abrasive but big hearted Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Walters) notices Billy's talent and is determined he should be enrolled in the Royal School of Ballet in London. The resistance of Billy's father breaks down when he see's Billy's incredible talent and he will do anything to get Billy to be able to follow his passion and have a chance at a better life
Together with a few gems like 'This England' this is one of the few movies to focus on Britain's ever neglected and abused white working class, betrayed first by Margaret Thatcher and then by the liberal and left middle class elit, on account of Third world immigrants and Muslims, Britain's white working class have been abused and kicked around by both conservatives and the left. Scenes of poverty, such as the little blond girl with her rag doll, who stands outside the council houses, add a gritty reality to a wonderful, heartwarming, inspiring and passionate movie. Notable scenes include the clash between Mrs Wilkinson and Billy's brother tony, when Billy runs away and shakes his body in angst and rage to the tune of 'A Town like Malice'. One of the best movies of 2000 and accompanied by a really powerful soundtrack, this is a highly recommended movie to watch again and again.",3,"[-1.7032952446875746, -1.7198181897655744, -1.1718147514064872, -1.0070616849828944, -1.23478001822253]",-1.0070616849828944
6016,"Gia Mirabelli is a temporary resident of the Hamptoms and an author struggling for inspiration. When she meets Rush it is definitely not love at first sight. He is handsome, but also rude, controlling, and intimidating. But she is not scared of him so throws just enough sass and challenge his way to peak his interest. Thus begins the often changing dynamics between these two.

They make each other crazy in so many ways and it is fun to watch...from stand offs, flirty and witty banter, companionship, sexual tension, fear, unresolved feelings, to taking a risk. They push, challenge, and scare the crap out of each other. It's a roller coaster of need, jealousy, resistance, fear, avoidance, boundaries, confusion, and resignation that they can't keep going on the way they are.

They already seem like opposites and come from two different worlds and financial circumstances. But they also look at the future differently. She is the romantic who wants the fairy tale. He is the more cynical one that usually does not get close enough to have a relationship. He has kept himself guarded and has some deep rooted fears. They are a hot mess, but I actually loved them together.

These two characters could be so much fun but frustrating too. Rush really grew on me as he started out as an a**, but turned awesome. He had a lot of his own baggage to deal with, but he also had a good heart and protective instincts. And Gia could see past his hard exterior and push him. I loved their baby steps in trying to figure out how to make themselves happy and deal with what was going on in their lives. Although their forward momentum was often set back due to circumstances, and their lives seemed to be getting more and more complicated.

This is part one of a duet so I knew going in that there was bound to be some heart stopping moment at the end that would leave me wanting book two, Rebel Heart right away. And there was...but I was prepared for it (and had figured it out), but it did not stop me from enjoying this one.

5227,"MURDER AT LOWRY HOUSE (Hazel Martin Mysteries Book 1) introduces another likable amateur female sleuth.  Hazel Martin is a widowed, wealthy, post-WWI British aristocrat, and a successful writer of popular mysteries.  She has a furry sidekick/confidant, her Siamese cat Dickens.  This cozy mystery is an enjoyable, fast read, even though the culprit is easily guessed early on.

In the novel, Hazel receives a note, handwritten on lavender paper, that summons her to a house party in celebration of her elderly friend Myrtle's upcoming eightieth birthday.  In the note, Myrtle confides that she fears one of her immediate family members is plotting to do her in.  Hazel is doubtful, but packs her bags and Dickens' things, and moves into Lowry House where she can investigate the circumstances of the possible recent attempts on Myrtle's life (sabotage of a garden path, a mixup of medications, a possible poisoning).

After yet another close call for Myrtle, Hazel is convinced that a killer is lurking.  Eventually, with some help from Dickens, Hazel figures out the murderer's motive and scheme, although she fails to thwart the planned murder.  After it occurs, it is investigated by Hazel's friend and prospective love interest, Detective Michael Gibson.

This is a well-written, if lightly plotted, cozy mystery.  There isn't much character development, but Hazel is memorable for her painstaking use of an assortment of classic fountain and dip pens (Parker, Waterman, etc.).  Author Leighann Dobbs really understands the cozy mystery genre, and has provided a pleasant, satisfying entertainment for cozy mystery fans.",3,"[-3.6555485380206845, -1.306595288832721, -1.034971921392576, -1.0078512414540315, -1.6185284707269272]",-1.0078512414540315

Erin is trying to find herself again, she's been grieving her brother, who she lost on 9/11, getting back from that loss has been a tough road for her. Erin has lost all hope, but when Slim walks back into her life, little by little he starts healing her heart and bringing her back to life.

They will all be favorites for me, because they're set in my birth place and home town of Seattle.  The stories seem so much more real when you can see the scenes in your mind.  But that is certainly no distraction from Jance's great writing abilities.  It's just an added attraction for me.  I really love the way her books are so smoothly written.  Everything is so clear and characters' feelings so easy to understand.  I almost never have to reread a passage to get the meaning, when written by Jance.

1209,"I picked up this novel just after finishing THE PANTHER by Nelson DeMille, a 625 page tome full of interesting detail but yet somewhat slow moving.  David Levien's newest book (273 pages) gave me the adrenaline rush provided by a well-informed author pitting an imperfect hero--my favorite kind--against a monster who has been on the loose for many years.  Providing us first person detail from the perspective of both of these combatants results in a moving chess game that showed them to both be experienced and very good at what each  have chosen as their life's work.

This is the first novel I've picked up written by David Levien and obviously not the first one in a series headlined by former detective Frank Behr.  Like many other former policemen, Frank is now scratching the outer perimeter of what he used to work in and is doing a fine job of not making much of a living.  Despite his previous failures, of which there must be quite a few, Frank dogs this case with a persistence not to be denied.  Once a suspect finally is identified, Frank Behr is faced with a choice on how to bring closure both to himself and to the families of those ruthlessly taken by this absolutely horrible killer.

Like several other serials that I seem to pick up midstream, I'll order the previous books in this series so that I can understand how the intricate character who is Frank Behr evolved into what he is in this novel.  If David Levien's  previous books are as good as this one, it will be a very enjoyable journey for me and anyone else who takes up the mantle.  This book is very graphic and violent.

If she wants to keep working with Gabriel they have to find a way to deal with his issues. They don't have much time to form an agreement though, as Olivia finds a dead woman in her car, someone who recently disappeared. There's no initial connection between Olivia and the woman, why was the body left for her to find?

Olivia isn't safe, even not in Cainsville. There's something going on in the town she doesn't know the details of. She needs the information to discover the truth before it's too late. Someone is after her and again she doesn't get her questions answered. Will she and Gabriel be able to find out enough before it's too late? Will Olivia's romantic life be a benefit or a burden in this case, how can she keep herself away from harm when she doesn't know her enemy?

Visions is a great gripping story filled with action, omens and mystery. I loved reading about Olivia's adventures again. She and Gabriel are slowly forming a friendship, but their bond isn't an uncomplicated one. Gabriel doesn't always consult Olivia when he makes decisions that concern her and that isn't a good plan.

Cainsville is a fantastic creepy series filled with surprising twists and turns and plenty of dark and evil plotting.

I'm surprised by how quickly I got wrapped up in this story once I began. A tornado blows through town and shakes up the lives of a small group of friends and the aftermath of it. What really caught me off guard was the budding romance between loner West and cheerleader princess Jules after he saves her life during the storm that rocked their small community.

For me, this was a light and easy read given the heavy subject matter. Picking up the pieces after such a devastating event changes your world in the blink of an eye. Following Jules's account which hops back and forth between a therapy session as she talks to a camera about her feelings. The ensuing drama revolving around rebuilding their lives as Jules tries to figure out her feelings for West that seem to catch her by surprise. I loved their relationship and getting to witness the slow build of watching them come together. West and Jules had a sweet back-story that melted my heart, hoping they'd get to be together. Even though Jules had a boyfriend, it's apparent early on that he won't be much of a contender for her affections. And although West and Jules are sort of thrown together during a traumatic event rather quickly; it works in their favor.

There were a few plot holes, unanswered questions and continuity mistakes in this book that drove me nuts early on. Parts of the story that seemed to be heading in one direction were abruptly cut off with no explanation given and the story continued on as if it wasn't an issue. It might not be to other readers but it bugged me a little bit. Even so, I got lost in the romance between West and Jules so it didn't hinder me from continuing on anyway. For a first book in the series it was pretty dang good. The writing could have been a little stronger, as the tense seemed to jump between first person and third/narrative, but I'd still recommend it just the same. There isn't a cliffhanger with this story but it does seem to continue on with the main couple in the next book. That's usually something I hate, following the same couple into a second book, but I'm excited nonetheless. This was a great way to occupy an otherwise boring day with nothing to do!",3,"[-3.196245594169727, -1.1275426344973607, -1.0206405194683668, -1.0084373089102343, -1.1654592000433892]",-1.0084373089102343

259,"Almost fifty years ago, a group of kids woke to find themselves trapped together in a walled village. There were no adults - they would soon find that there was in fact no one over the age of seventeen - and with the exception of siblings, none of them knew one another. They'd assumed that some tragic event left them alone in their town and with no memories. From that point forward, they called their town Claysoot and did their best to make a life for themselves. One of the things they'd soon discover was the Heist, the disappearance of any male on his eighteenth birthday. A few brave souls would attempt to breach the wall over the years, but their charred remains were always discovered within days of their climb.

Gray and his brother Blaine have only ever known life in Claysoot. Gray has planned everything carefully, avoiding situations that will make his own Heist harder. When Blaine is taken, Gray makes a startling discovery, one that will force him to attempt what no one before him has been able to do - climb the wall and survive.

I'm on the fence about this one. It was a fun enough read, but nothing felt all that amazing or stand out about it. Instead, it was similar in a lot of ways to a variety of futuristic, dystopian releases of late, some of which have been more exciting and others that haven't.

3788,"I liked how this novel was split into two parts. The first section introduces the journey of Carly Smythe and Jase Steele. They live on separate coasts but meet one summer while Carly is visiting her family in Jersey. The second section is the meat of the story where everything happens. This is a story of opposites attracting but not necessarily meant to last.

Carly wasn't planning for a romance on her vacation to the east coast. She is innocent and inexperienced when it comes to relationships so she appears to be the typical good girl. Her participation in this smutty book club gives her plenty of insight on the possibilities that made me giggle. I appreciate the known references! Meeting Jase at the beach might be the first impulsive decision she has ever made but she cannot resist him.

Jase Steele is clearly a bad boy and not afraid to flaunt it. It is obvious he has secrets piled up but it takes a while for anything to be revealed. The more time he spends with Carly, the more this charming side of him emerges. He makes some super sweet gestures that made me realize he was just waiting for the right girl. Carly is very different from anyone he has ever met so he pulls out all the stops eventually.

Their interactions prove how naive she is and left me wondering what was going on. They meet up and have these strange discussions, which result in Carly stomping off back home. She keeps walking away from him but then going back. The whole set up seemed odd to me. I was hoping her character development improved as the novel went on. There was a ton of back and forth in this story that frustrated me. I felt the structure could use some grooming to improve the pacing, especially in the first half. About midway through, pieces began to fall into place and the storyline made more sense. I really wish Carly and Jase spent less time pushing each other away and more time happy together.

Overall, Jase was a good read. It has solid components that carry the story and keep it flowing. The strong areas were enough to keep me reading. Carly and Jase form a bond that was very special. What they must overcome is quite inspiring. I will definitely look into other books by this author.

Thank you Delilah Marvelle for pushing past the boundaries and taking your readers into a story that is unique, powerful, intense, emotional and a joy to read.  For most of us we do not associate pleasure and pain as going together.  Our hero Malcolm does.  Just a warning, the prologue is very graphic and parts obscene, but it is an intricate part of the story and explains why Malcolm feels the way he does. He believes that he cannot never have a normal life with a woman because he is afraid of losing control of his desires and hurting her with obesession with pain.  He keeps tight control over himself at all times and even though he has been tempted over the years, he is still a virgin.  Then he meets Leona the heroine when he rescues her from a group of ruffians who have confiscated all her belongings to pay a debt.  She is an unwed mother who is trying to support herself and her son in a world where she is considered unfit for any employment or way to improve her son's life.

1886,"Hag-Seed, Margaret Atwood's update of The Tempest gets off to a bumping start.  It is not so much challenging as it is slow to get out of the gate.  For the first half of the book her Prospero, Felix Phillips, (later Mr. Duke) is the rather unappealing and disagreeable head of a repertory company staging Shakespeare's masterpiece.  In a story thread that owes more to All About Eve than the Bard, Felix is undermined and undone by an assistant in some not very convincing circumstances that send his career into a death spiral and send him into a self-imposed exile.  Where do managing directors go when they lose their companies?  To jail of course, to nurture the unpolished gems found there and plumb the population's emotional depth.  Most irritatingly, the only irony here seems to be in the main character's name...Felix.

I can't imagine any fan of Shakespeare or Ms. Atwood finding pleasure in the first half of the book and one might, as I did, cringe at the setting for the second half of Hag-Seed.  To do so is to underestimate the author's imaginative powers which are on full display throughout the rest of the story.  It is here that Hag-Seed finally seems successfully anchored to The Tempest and unquestionably soars.  Felix (now incognito as Mr. Duke) works with inmates to uncover the pleasures, the challenges and the joys of language that unfold for the players and for the reader.  It is really a stunning accomplishment, and I strongly suggest high schools across America lift a few of her Shakespearean ""raps"" when introducing the Bard to recalcitrant 16 year olds. Equally delightful are the discussions among ""players"" sparked by Mr. Duke as they sort through the author's intent and its meaning for them.

That the author redeems a very unpromising beginning so terrifically makes her more than a bit of a magician, too.  Atwood's Hag-Seed is an always welcome reminder of the magical power art has to enliven and enrich us all.  If it requires patience, remember dear reader, patience is a virtue.",2,"[-2.5263559408262566, -1.2676016991304093, -1.009045812798698, -1.04444004976862, -1.0189729120798534]",-1.009045812798698

Inspired by the life of a 19th century woman rice planter, CAROLINA GOLD continues Dorothy Loves winning tradition of weaving together mystery, romance, and rich historical detail, bringing to life the story of one young womans struggle to restore her ruined world.(Goodreads)

 My Review
Dorothy Love is a great author. I love her previous book Every Perfect Gift. This book takes on a new idea and feel in South Carolina. I thought this book would be even more fun to read now since we visited this area this spring. I love the historical facts and how Dorothy paints the picture of how the south was after the Civil War-pretty much in ruins. The characters struggle, Charlotte reminds me a lot of Scarlett from Gone With the Wind. Really it's the same idea from the second half of the movie, Charlotte gets things done and tries to continue rice farming and maintain her father's house. The author got this book idea from a real person, Elizabeth Pringle.

While I love most of the aspects and setting for this story, it was extremely difficult for me to enjoy reading Charlotte's character. She is not my favorite character and I felt like there wasn't enough depth for me to really find out who she was. I do love the setting and the minor characters are wonderful. I know many others will enjoy this historical fiction but the romance and lead character did not hold my grasp.

She had a tough time until she was 22 working in a bar and a man from a modeling agency gave her an opportunity of a lifetime.  Through all this, Jaxxon stayed true to herself.  She didn't take BS and didn't become someone she wasn't.  What I didn't care for was that if Connor had not seen her picture on a magazine, he would not have given her a second thought.  It's been eight years since they have seen each other.  Besides the first year he was gone, he never thought about her again.  He is crazy possessive.  Words like Hulk, red haze, the flip of a switch describes his rage when someone wants what's his.  He basically lies to himself through the whole book, saying he just wants a casual affair nothing permanent but his actions defies his words.",3,"[-2.397354987476713, -1.1465168382433435, -1.0996553117423526, -1.0090613228995566, -1.4821403047723822]",-1.0090613228995566

Damian, Earl of Windermere who we have met in the previous books has foolishly gambled away his inheritance from his mother, and if that isn't bad enough he lost it to one of his best friends who then lost it that same night.  The next day he wakes up and vows never to gamble again and turns his back on his best friend Julian Fortescue, who he blames for his troubles.  To regain his mother's estate he must marry the neice of the man who now owns it.  He marries her and then leaves for a year long diplomatic post in Persia.  He returns a year later to find that his provincial cit wife has turned into a beauty and is rumored to be having an affair with his former best friend Julian, now the Duke of Denford.  Cynthia does not know her husband and is not about to just resume their marriage because he says so.  Damian does not believe her when she tells him she is not having an affair with Julian, she says they are just friends.  There are alot of misunderstandings and misconceptions between them that they cannot seem to get past.  He is a diplomat who hides his feelings well and she is afraid that he only wants her because she is his possesion.  They wind up stranded together in an Inn in a snowstorm where they actually start to learn about his other and how the lives they have lead up to this point has shaped them into the people they are.  The interaction between Damian and Cynthia  is intense,  I love the way that she stands up to him and makes him realize how bad he treated her.  Miranda's prose and style are one of the best in the genre today.  She also can write some pretty steamy love scenes.  This book was very good and had a very satisfying ending.

Just $0.99 for the ebook short story, it represents a link between the first and second books in the series and does a great job of giving the reader a flavor for the storyline and plot.

When he was a young reporter, back in the late 60s, Arthur Crane exposed the secrets behind the cult murderer known as the Orchid Killer. And now in the present day Crane wakes to find an orchid on his pillow, the signature of the murderer, and triggers some strong memories within him, opening up links to his estranged brother.

Family, joy, death and sadness; Blood Brothers has it all in a short story set in San Francisco that takes the reader on a wild ride both into the past and present and across the streets of the iconic city. Whether you're a Rollins, Cantrell or Order of the Sanguines fan, or just want to give this story a try, you're in for a real treat.

For those who have read other anti-Hilary books, or who read the columns of many leading conservatives in the media, most of this will seem repetitive.  And I think there's still a good book - and a more balanced one - waiting to be written about Ms Clinton.

As with most of these books, your political viewpoint will undoubtedly affect your enjoyment of the book.  The left won't want to hear any of the valid criticisms, a fact that's already been proven by all the one-star reviews on here by people who probably haven't even read the dust jacket, much less the book itself.  If you lean towards the right, or if you're just a Hilary-hater in general, you'll likely enjoy reading about her supposed evil, scheming ways.

Klein's writing is good, even if some of what he writes seems unbelievable.  He tends to reach at times, but without that reaching this book wouldn't have generated such controversry.  This is just another average entry in a crowded field of books about political leaders, one not much better or worse than most of what is already out there.",3,"[-1.7622997524579633, -1.1305522649990627, -1.0605495231256703, -1.0097303904874357, -1.348495066569153]",-1.0097303904874357

The Amish Nanny is about Ada, the sister Lexie in Amish Midwife never knew she had.  Ada was sheltered with so many secrets her family kept that Ada was pretty much kept at home and backward. Her poor health played a part in this as well, as her Amish family didn't trust ""Englisch"" medicine, so she never got the treatment she could have (until her new-found sister Lexie was able to help).
When Lexie came to their town to find out who she really was, and who her family really was, She and Ada found out they were sisters and this changed Ada from a quiet shy unhealthy girl to someone more sure of herself.
She's given an opportunity to travel as a nanny and locate the birth mother she never knew she had until recently. The woman she called mother all her life, and was kept a secret, was actually her aunt.

Besides the arranged marriage, there are the health problems experienced by the couple, the deaf daughter's emotional problems, and a hint of the supernatural, too.  I liked the characters and felt for the situation they found themselves in, but both of them got on my nerves a bit for some choices they made and for not explaining things.  I liked the romance, but I would have liked more to it, more interaction or moments that would show their growing feelings.  Instead, it felt a bit abrupt to me.  I found Hannah very interesting and wished the supernatural aspect had been developed more.  Overall, I liked the story and will look for more from this author.

A Witchs Tale: Stuff & Things and What Boredom Brings by Rue Volley is a cute Young Adult (YA) coming of age novel. It is clearly the first in a series. There isn't a huge cliffhanger, however, the story is ended at a clear beginning for the young town folk of Ravenswood. This first Witchs Tale book is a good set up for the series with a balance of setting and character development along with sufficient action and plot tension.

Alexis mother died a while ago, but her dad, Christopher, has diligently raised her. Christopher is a cool dad; he is watchful and involved without being overly controlling. He has adequately covered both parents roles. It is not clear how much Christopher knows of his wifes secrets and has chosen not to share with Alexi versus how unaware he is of his deceased wifes real identity and talents. Some of the ladies in town are particularly interested in the widower; they give off a slightly creepy vibe that that made this reader ponder their role in the overall situation in Ravenswood and with Alexi in particular. Lovable Logan and mysterious newcomer, Kyle, are potential suitors to Alexi, and they provide much of the angst and underlying sense of dread.

A Witchs Tale is delightful in its creative premise and unique blend of characters. The story has the right amount of rich details to paint the scene, and the pace of the story moves along at just the speed. The story isn't rushed and it isn't mired in so much detail that there is no plot. This YA paranormal series is perfect for fans of the Blue Bloods series. Im looking forward to the continuation of this series.

Please, please, please read Savage Collision (Book 1) first. This is one of those series that you really want to read in order. Also, please note that in my first review I said Savage was my new book boyfriend, well Ive moved on. Gabe Anderson is now my book boyfriend (Sorry Savage).

Skye Hawke has had some tragedy in her life and has worked like the dickens to overcome and move on. Its not easy and everyone looks at her just a little differently. Skye is a grown woman who still has some bratty tendencies. She is a professional in the work place and is still trying to find her new place in her family. Her new reality is a little hard for her to take sometimes because of guilt and part of her soul being missing.

Gabe understands about soul connections because he and her brother Savage have a similar connection. Herein lies the problem. Skye is Gabes best friends little sister. Ruh roh - you see where this is going, right? Gabe served several tours of duty, suffers from PTSD as well as a few other issues and tries really hard to work on himself and move on in his life. He knows right from wrong and struggles with decisions.

I was so excited to read this book. I just knew there was a story behind Gabe and what makes him tick. I was not disappointed in even one page of this story.

Once again, I go on record as saying Gwyn McNamee must be a pen name. Her sophomore book does not read as someone who is still honing her craft.

The book starts off with Amanda's life as she grew up in a dysfunctional family, in rural Alberta without a lot of money.
To keep herself sane Amanda would buy National Geographic magazines, from the thrift stores and daydream of taking trips to the wonderful places she would see, and read about.
Once she moved away from home and went to Calgary, where she found a job that would make her good money and afford her to travel, she would do so, until she needed to go home and save up some more. She first started in the Americas and then India, the Near East and Middle East, until deciding to go to Somalia in Africa. On one of these trips she met an aspiring photojournalist,  Nigel, with whom she fell in love, yet years later as just friends she calls and asks him if he wants to join her in Somalia to do a story and take photos, he agrees and they meet in Kenya, excited about their journey, until the fateful day that they were kidnapped by an extremist group, who wanted money.
It is amazing what the mind and body can endure when one has the will to live. You will see what they do to try and make their lives a bit better, and their copping mechanisms.

A paragraph or two between them about their pasts would have been sufficient and it would have made a huge difference to me when she becomes jealous and why he is protective of her if the other knew the history. Otherwise a great start, great plot, great characters and I cant wait for the next one.

Once upon a time there was civilization. Something called ""The Damn Stupid"" happened and that civilization was destroyed. What people that remain revert to a technological level of hunting and subsistence farming. The weather changed also, producing something called a Thunderhead, a sort of tornado. But that is just background.
This is a coming of age story, set in post-apocalyptic North America. Elka lives in BeeCee or BC, what we would know as British Columbia. She lives alone with a man she calls Trapper, who found her lost in the woods. He teaches her everything she knows, warping her perceptions along the way. The story is her journey away from Trapper's worldview toward one where she can be her best self.
I enjoyed the story. Once I became comfortable with the style of the language used, I felt I understood Elka's struggles. She learns that she is not just what Trapper had her believe, even though she doesn't quite know who she could be.

1469,"The Fifth Assassin is a follow-on to The Inner Circle. Beecher, the archivist is back for another round. In this case, someone is authentically recreating past presidential assassinations in excruciating detail that only someone like Beecher could appreciate. Beecher's suspicions move from person to person, all the while he's lining up in the cross-hairs of the President still gunning for him from before. The plot is fast moving and reveals quite a bit about Beecher's early life in Sagamore, Wisconsin. At the same time, there are numerous plot twists with some very surprising revelations. Beecher's loyalty to the Culper Ring is tested as more of their workings are revealed. All the main characters from before are back and some of the dead don't stay dead. While the ending provides closure for this particular assassin, it's clear that this is a longer story arc and will require at least one more installment for the final denouement between Beecher and the President.

As far as reading enjoyment goes, the book is well crafted, with good pacing, and much dramatic tension throughout. At he same time, the negative aspects are prominent. There are simply too many coincidental circumstances throughout. Sagamore is too tiny a town to have so many people end up in DC, especially with Federal jobs. It's also strange that three dads from that town ended up in the military on the same secret project. While the motivation for the assassin may have had merit, the ritualistic attention to flawless recreation of past assassinations made no sense whatsoever. Beecher cast as a suspect also made little sense. At the same time, Nico's role appeared integral, but without actual substance. Finally, while historical elements are welcome, judicious use is warranted. In this case, the presidential assassinations, playing cards, and secret societies just overwhelmed the present day story.

Hopefully in the finale, Beecher can achieve some degree of closure without the need for another series of bizarre killings, Presidential overreach, and a military cover-up.

When the opportunity presents itself to her she jumps at the chance to accompany 15 year old Louise Brooks to New York City where Louise will be attending dance school.

This book follows the history of what is known about Louise Brooks and her family closely.  It explores the 1920's and the prevalent attitudes of the time examining Prohibition, the Ku Klux Klan and sexual mores.  We find that Cora carries as many secrets as young Louise does.  Louise with her outspoken behavior challenges Cora and forces her to reexamine her life and her beliefs.  We discover Cora's hidden secrets and the reason she so readily came to New York City.

After Cora is transformed by the city we follow her life quietly as she move from one age to the next.

It's impossible for Holt to look away from the Amazing Arden. Only hours later, Holt arrives on the scene to see evidence that the magician's husband has been murdered and his body shoved in the same box she had used earlier for her trick. Arden is the number one suspect.

It is only by chance that Holt is able to capture Arden and he holds her prisoner in the small jail until he can turn her over to the other authorities. Arden has only the night to tell her story and convince Holt that she is innocent of the murder of her husband.

With magic and illusion, The Magician's Lie by Greer Macallister captured my attention from the first page.

Arden is a fascinating character who is adept at survival and self-promotion. Her story is compelling and filled with danger, intrigue, passion and love. Carefully plotted, Arden's story is beguiling and like Holt, the reader is never sure what to believe and what not to believe.

Because I was fully in love with the world created in The Magician's Lie, I was sad to see it end. With that love, I would have liked better development of some of the supporting characters. Because of the narrative style, Arden is telling her story to Holt. I would have loved to be more immersed in her world and the people she associated with on the circuit.

Macallister is at her best writing about the gruesome fire that destroyed the Iroquois Theater in Chicago. Arming herself with history, Macallister uses this as a critical point in Arden's story while bringing the reader right into the horrifying disaster. Placing historical figures at moments in Arden's life, including the relationship between Arden and the very real female magician Adelaide Herrmann also gives the story strength and credibility. The historical time period works perfectly for Adren's tale.

I was entranced by The Magician's Lie. It is beautiful, thrilling, dangerous and compelling. Talented and gifted, the Amazing Arden has a magic that is equally enthralling and horrible. It was hard to put it down and I wanted almost immediately to read it again.

8060,"FADE INTO YOU (Fade Series #1) by Kate Dawes

FADE INTO YOU is the first novella (July 2012 release) in Kate Dawes three-part novella series featuring Olivia Rowland as the Midwestern girl who heads to Los Angeles to work for a Hollywood talent agent.  Following in the same vein as many of the serial storylines similar to EL James, Beth Kery and Lisa Renee Jones, Kate Dawes has released this trilogy over a period of a few months.  Fade Into You introduces Olivia and Max Dalton, Hollywood's youngest and brightest movie director/producer/writer.

Olivia's decision to move to California was two-fold.  Following graduation from college, Olivia found a position working for local talent agent Kevin Anderson and moved in with her sister's friend Krystal from back home.  But Olivia was also trying to place distance between Ohio and the past. Hoping that Los Angeles was far enough from Ohio, Olivia embarked on a new career and a new life.  And Olivia did not expect to find herself falling head over heals for anyone, let alone Hollywood's bad boy leading director Max Dalton. When their promising new client was signed by Max for his latest film, Olivia had no idea the position she was about to undertake.

Max Dalton has had his share of women-any woman.  But Max, as successful as his is, was missing something, missing a connection with the trail of women who seemingly throw themselves at his feet where ever he goes. And Max was surprised when he spotted Olivia Rowland, the assistant to talent agent Kevin Anderson, in Vegas.  Without a thought, Max decided that Olivia was someone he wanted to get to know.  But life had a way of interrupting and it wasn't until he was back in LA did Max find Olivia, once again, and this time, he made sure that they would not be interrupted again. But it was Max's quick dismissal shortly after their first night together that would have Olivia regretting her decision about Max.

Like many novellas, the sexual relationship is quick to develop, but we do learn that there is some history and a past to each of our leading characters.  And it is Olivia's past that we will encounter first when he arrives at her doorstep uninvited.

FADE INTO YOU is a promising storyline with potential.  Like many of the books and series written in the same style, our leading characters are hiding painful pasts and secrets that they are tying to escape.",3,"[-2.9176071293412233, -1.052544978688073, -1.1068028178247056, -1.0117746982235367, -1.0214588798095565]",-1.0117746982235367
3420,"Three events of great importance occurred in Spain in 1492. First, the armies of Ferdinand and Isabella conquered Granada and flushed the Muslims from Europe. Then the monarchs signed the Edict of Expulsion, intended to rid Spain of its Jews. And finally, a band of intrepid men set sail with Columbus to seek a new trade route to the orient.

Its against this background of events Zelvin has set her entertaining and historically accurate Diego Mendoza stories.

All of the men with Columbus had reason for trepidation, though it was tempered with hope of riches and honors. Mendoza has additional reason for worryhes a Jew, a fact known only to Columbus. Though Jews had been toleratedeven respectedin the past, they were now the target of the Inquisition. Even those who had converted to Christianity found themselves at risk of torture, exile or even death.

The author told the events of the first voyage in two previously published short stories. Voyages of Strangers begins on Dec. 24, 1492 when the Santa Maria wrecked on shoals on the coast of Hispaniola.

Leaving a small garrison behind, Columbus and the main body (including Diego) return to Spain where the navigator is honored and begins preparations for the second voyage. While assisting in that process, Diego is also feverishly attempting to smuggle his teenaged sister Rachel out of Spain and reunited with their parents in Italy.

Rachel, a headstrong and intelligent girl, has ideas of her own. After some hairy episodes in Spain, Diego is just breathing a sigh of relief when he discovers shes smuggled herself aboard his ship disguised as a boy. Columbus agrees to take her on as a scribe, thus keeping her safe as they once again cross the Atlantic. Theres some evidence Columbus came from a family of Conversos, Jews who converted, though he was in practice a devout Christian. Rather than rely on that speculation, Zelvin has him protect Diego and Rachel out of the goodness of his heart and because he was friends with their father.

As the Spaniards (and Columbus) become corrupted by the lust for wealth and power, Diego and Rachel find love among the native Taino, whose lot becomes as tenuous as that of the Jews at home, and find their own lives again in jeopardy.

An admirable work of fiction. I hope Zelvin will treat us to more of the adventures of Diego and Rachel in future.",2,"[-3.2569297668769233, -1.6917512832952688, -1.0117813394871726, -1.0279402522826935, -1.2170945898904466]",-1.0117813394871726

Jameson is a born wolf and a strong member of the Feral Breed MC. A year earlier he found his mate lying among the dead bodies at a massacre and has dreamed of her and grieved her loss ever since.
Aoife is an archer, necromancer and deadtalker who helps spirits transition into the afterlife. Overcome by the sheer number of new spirits, she was in a trance between worlds when Jameson found her and thought she was dead. She has dreamed of him every night since then, believing him to be a fantasy.  But when she and Percy, a childhood friend and foreteller, travel to a lighthouse near Merriweather Fields to help witches under attack, she sees a man she thought existed only in her mind.

They are polar opposites - Whiskey is outgoing, a daredevil,  and Charlie is much more introspective - and envious of Whiskey's ease in traveling through life.

They haven't talked for years and all of a sudden Whiskey is in a terrible accident and lies in a coma. And Charlie hopes he will be able to make amends for the past.

Anyone who has been in the middle of family conflicts will relate to this story. It explores the many feelings that Whiskey's accident brought out - in Charlie, in Whiskey's wife, in their mother and more.

Charlie is not an easy character to like but he is an interesting one. There are a lot of emotional highs and lows in the story and the middle part of the book dragged - and then the ending seemed rushed.

Brad and Julia are engaged and she has one stipulation. She wants to be a fianc for a full year before walking down the aisle. Julia just wants to make sure Brad can truly handle being in a committed relationship. But, that doesn't mean they won't still bring other people into their bedroom. The only thing I couldn't understand was how, being an alpha male, Brad could sit back and watch another man pleasure Julia. It was definitely different, but so entertaining.

""You know, I will never need anything more than you.""

I love the transformation that Brad made throughout the series. He went from a total man-whore that wanted nothing more than sex, to a man completely and utterly in love. Not having had much love in his life, Julia rocked his world and made him realize what he was missing. The way the wedding ended up working out was perfect. I really wanted something small and more meaningful for them.

Jeff Guinn in his book The Last Gunfight, the Real Story of the Shootout at the O.K. Corral--and How it Changed the American West  attempts to sort myth and fact. Guinn who has done meticulous research while writing this book, is not about to let the Earp myth blind him.  In fact he goes to the other extreme and portrays Earp as a man of many faults.

Guinn does indeed build a background which explains the development of the American West, the personalities involved and the peculiar region and politics of Cochise County, Arizona where Tombstone was located.  I am grateful for his ability to provide me with this information, however with all the background information, the road to the gunfight is exceedingly long with Chapter 13, titled The Gunfight beginning on page 205.

As clearly and carefully that Guinn developed the background to the gunfight, one would expect him to utilize the same precision in explaining how the west was changed by this gunfight.  Sadly this did not happen and to me it seems as if it could easily be dropped from the title.

So many series place character drama over plot development, and some of this series has done just that, but not so in this installment. Those of you looking for soul mate angst and Quinn drama will be sorely disappointed. Those of you, like me, who love a good plot, an exciting storyline, and a detailed mystery, will love this. The series, and this book, do have one shortcoming though. Riley seems to bounce back and forth from wanting to be only committed to Quinn to wanted to jump any good looking male in the vicinity. While I was a tad irritated with this at first, I'm used to it now, and I don't expect anything less from her. I think Riley is one of the most unique heroines that I've read in any genre. She cares about what goes on around her, she thinks about the consequences before doing anything, and feels very guilty when she messes up. It would be one thing for her to blame her wolf and not be concerned with her infidelity, but that's not the case. She is complex, and she is not perfect. Her raging hormones were once a source of irritation, but now I feel they just add to her depth. I can't wait for the ninth installment in this series, even if it is mostly character based. I've grown to love every character in this series, and I applaud Keri Arthur's ability to create such an engrossing mystery with such fully realized characters. Bound to Shadows will definitely get your blood pumping. It's full of action, mystery, suspense, and of course a large dose of steaminess.

Tom has emotional and physical scars from growing up gay, but he doesn't let them stop him from engaging full tilt in life and romance when it comes along. He also has a fascinating psychic talent (for finding things and people) that immerses him in an interesting murder mystery.

His romantic interest comes with a huge package (sorry, couldn't resist) of guilt and resentment attached. The two spend a great deal of the book bickering, but considering their background it's understandable.

First of all, the couple is strong and deeply motivated. They have machinations of their own and they collide full front. Ryan is a criminal, he runs a lab and plans to put his chemistry knowledge as well as his devious mind to very good use against the mafia empire in the city. On the other hand, Sarine is an undercover cop who is in charge of bringing down whoever the drug F king is.

That's a hell of a conundrum, especially when they fall in love. I relished reading this story because of many aspects. The writing is strong and it shows both characters' minds as the fully developed people they are. They have understandable reasons for their actions, both the criminal acts and the betrayal. I felt for both of them.

Then, the romance and the suspense plot really combine to the letter. While they embark on this forbidden romance full of lust, longing and truly exhilarating intimate scenes, there is this other side of drugs, violence, thugs, Machiavellian plans and smart plotting.

Ryan is a lovable bad boy. He's tough but also cares for his family. And he's as sensually provocative as he needs to be. The first time he and Sarine are together, and the scene at that original restaurant are absolutely unforgettable!

The final part is pure adrenaline. It blows the mind with all that violence, shattered dreams, truth exposed and fated commitment. I was very sad with some of the events going on, and the last page felt harsh and abrupt, yet it's also impressive, very impressive. This series is amazing.

4185,"From the moment I read the synopsis of I Am Alive I knew I wanted to read it  dystopian society, ranking scales and a game where teenagers fight for their lives? Its like a mash up of every dystopian book that Ive ever enjoyed, with a bit of romance thrown in for good measure. And I Am Alive certainly didn't disappoint.

Decca definitely has some secrets, and in the course of the book more and more of them emerge as she fights for her life in a society where you are judged on your potential to be a good person in a variety of ways. I really liked her toughness but also her vulnerability, especially when it comes to the people she cares about. Coupled with a great sarcastic sense of humour and an ability to quickly adapt to the situation she finds herself in, she was a great character to ride along with.

The pace of I Am Alive is pretty much full-throttle the whole way through and right from the first page I was intrigued to find out exactly what would happen, and as more of the world was revealed I was more and more hooked in the story. Along with some very imaginative plot lines (genetically modified tigers anyone?!), the action scenes were a great mixture of tension and intensity.

I found the world-building both fun and fascinating and fully appreciated the authors ability to be both serious and a little bit clich at the same time. Along with the plot itself being a well-done mixture of dystopian key elements, there are also some fun takes on pop culture and history that I found almost amusing as well as being relevant to the story.

There were a couple of moments that I was confused by what was happening, and the characters are not completely developed (although this is understandable for a first book in a series) and one section where the editing needed a little bit of work, but overall I really enjoyed this fast-paced dystopian with some fun elements thrown in. The ending in particular really stuck with me, so much so that I dreamed I was in that world myself the night after finishing the book.",3,"[-2.547762131826357, -2.009151289258886, -1.0572127499693973, -1.013901000737558, -1.2325509455599455]",-1.013901000737558

Oliver finds himself longing for Schuyler. He knows that she's gone possibly forever and yet...he's in so much pain. He can't get her out of his head. Then he meets Freya. She might have the power to break the bond between Oliver and Schuyler.

Allegra doesn't feel right after what happened in Florence. At the moment, Charles is her twin brother. In this world, a twin brother with a crush on you doesn't fit in. Allegra cares for Charles, but she feels no longer worthy of his love. Instead, out of guilt and anger she pushes him away. Matters don't improve when she starts spending time with Ben.

Schuyler and Jack have been waiting for their bonding - waiting for the time when they will truly belong to each other. Schuyler wants everything to be perfect. She searches for the right dress to make the occasion perfect. There's one thing missing from her big day: her friends. Jack goes to great lengths to reach out to her friends in hopes they will join the couple. But Schuyler's great wish could also be her downfall.

1885,"I was so overjoyed when I finally had a chance to sit down and actually read, ""Paris for One,"" by the author, JoJo Moyes. Mostly, my excitement was from reading yet another novel by one of my favorite authors and yet I do have to confess that the rush of happiness lingered more when I found out this novel contained short stories. I adore short stories and I wish that authors would write more short stories than what is currently being published in the industry.

  ""Paris for One,"" is a group of short stories written by Moyes that is centered mostly around Paris, love and of course women who are learning lessons in both romance and in life. As a nice little treat, there is enough a short story entitled, ""The Christmas List,"" that is a truly an engaging holiday read.

  My favorite story of the book is also the first one, ""Paris for One,"" as I felt like Nell was a heroine that I could most relate to. She and her boyfriend were supposed to take this magical tour of Paris when he ends up standing her up and therefore misses the train.  During the time that Nell is in Paris, she has a lot of obstacles to overcome including to having to share her rented hotel room. I really loved how determined Nell was to discover Paris for herself and by doing so she learns more about who she is than she has ever before. Overall I just loved this story.

 The rest of the collection of short stories are worth applauding as well. Each story contains their own unique characters, mostly women that are having their inner-struggles regarding romance.  I would without a doubt recommend this collection of short stories!",4,"[-2.2512860071576193, -1.3100749485442087, -1.0918430167730442, -1.0328439243125374, -1.0139825605142276]",-1.0139825605142276
2148,"The Creole Princess by Beth White is the second book in the Gulf Coast Chronicles, and it kept me as entertained as the first book. While this book focuses on the same family as the first book, the series takes place many years later with later generations of the same family during the Revolutionary War. Although history was always my favorite subject, I don't remember learning about this time in history and the British, French, and Spanish people living in the Gulf area.

Lyse Lanier is a young Creole girl living at the Gulf Coast with a father who spends a large majority of his time drinking after the death of his first wife. Lyse soon meets Don Rafael Maria Gonzales de Rippardi, who is a well-known merchant, but is he really who everyone thinks he is? I really liked reading about their growing relationship, even though I wasn't the biggest fan of Dan Rafael at the beginning of the book due to his seemingly cocky nature. I ended up really liking the two of them together by the end of the book.

I think this is a great book for anyone who is interested in history, and there are a lot of different facts that are included in this series. Although you don't need to read the first book in the series to follow what is happening in The Creole Princess, I am glad I read the first book so I was familiar with the Lanier family history when they mentioned it in the book.

Last read this aged 13, when I loved it. Re-reading it forty years later, I still find it a jolly good read.
Set in foggy Victorian London, the novel opens with a married couple - the Buntings, previously servants and now reduced to a state of penury as they fail to find lodgers for their spare rooms. And then comes a knock at the door and their problems seem answered, with the arrival of prospective tenant Mr Sleuth - a gentleman, no less, who pays in advance and likes to read the Bible.
But in the first few pages we realise Mr Sleuth is somewhat peculiar: a man who does experiments in his rooms and demands to be left alone. And why does he go out late at night into the foggy streets?
Meanwhile London is suffering a series of Jack-the-Ripper type attacks on young women of alcoholic persuasion...

I have to put a disclaimer on this review by saying that I am not a Johnny Depp fan and am really getting sick of him playing the same role over and over. Having said that this movie is deceiving. The preview made it seem like it was a comedy, while there are funny parts this is not really a straight comedy. I never saw the TV show so I wasn't sure what to expect but to me the movie had the feel of less funny ""Death Becomes Her"" as far as comedy goes. To me the best parts were the old maid who doesn't speak at all and the soundtrack (as well as Alice Cooper). There were some pretty funny lines and Depp did do a good job but this is his typical character lately so I can't really be impressed by his acting. I will admit though that if you are a Johnny Depp fan then you will probably really enjoy this movie and totally disagree with my review. As far as my feelings I thought it was a little slow moving and seemed confused as to whether it wanted to be funny or not.

He has this formal way of speaking that just amped the hotness vibe. Man oh man, he is delicious. He is also determined that Ava is not going to get away from him. Shes broken their engagement but hes just not getting the message. I enjoyed reading the different ways she tried to get rid of the ring and how it kept showing back up.

The Harlequin feel dies down as the story deepens and we are shown Ava and Mateos pasts and what has led up to present day. Sometimes back flashes can be confusing but this author was clear with each transition and I never felt lost with the timeline. I was so anxious to find out what had transpired to bring this couple who apparently had it all to the crossroad where they now stood.

I was totally into this story and when finished immediately started checking to see if I had other books by this author. I mean come on, if Mateo is just one of her alphas, I cant imagine what all the others will be like.

At only 102 pages, almost qualifying as a ""novella."" Though the action and suspense is fast and furious throughout the book, as is typical of Morgan thrillers, the majority of it is ""old hat"" for books of this type and genre. Very little seemed particularly original. The biggest problem I personally had with this read is the utter stupidity and unrealistic behavior & decisions made by the character that is his daughter Alex. Other than that, the rest of the characters, plot and book make for an engaging, entertaining, fast-paced read.",3,"[-3.579758261435651, -1.7464179409174263, -1.0596746467555396, -1.0158538388957383, -1.0462636248301935]",-1.0158538388957383

This novella was just what I needed to get my fix of the Mayson men and women.  We get to see how Novembers dad, Mike is coping with single life and what the others are up too.

Mike has been living a single happy life until a chance encounter with an old high school friend, Kathleen.  It has been years since they have seen each other but when she moved back to town to raise her teenage son; Mike decided that they will be seeing more of each other.

As their relationship mostly consists of a night here and there, Kathleen wants more.  She is not getting any younger.  When faced with the decision, Mike realizes that he wants to have a life with Kathleen and her son Brandon.  He will be the father figure that Brandon needs in his life as his own father has started a new life.

They all continue to grow closer and soon you realize that everyone deserve a second chance.  Not only do we get a big surprise in the story but we get a glimpse into what the Mayson men are up too.

Set in Seattle in dual time periods, 1909 and 1962, Ernest is raffled off at the age of twelve at the 1909 Seattle World's Fair and goes to live and work in a high class brothel. He is treated well there and becomes friends with Maisie, the daughter of the brothel's Madame Flora, and Fahn, a scullery maid at the brothel. In 1962, Ernest, through the coaxing of his journalist daughter, tells her his story of how he arrived in America, his time living in the brothel, and meeting Gracie there, his wife who is suffering from dementia. This is a heartbreaking but beautiful story that is masterfully written by Jamie Ford. I highly recommend it.

This was an intense read. I hadn't read the first book in the series (although I will go and do that now). Avery, Parker and the other parts of the investigation team as they come together to solve the mysterious disappearance of Avery's friend Skylar have some great moments. This book deals with that mystery, and also Avery and Parker's past relationship that rekindles as they spend more time together trying to solve Skylar's disappearance.  The first few chapters were a bit confusing for me, not having read the other book in this series, I had a hard time when it flipped to the other characters on the team, but enjoyed the other moments as the team unearthed and dug for connections and clues with the crime scenes and the suspects in the case.  So much tension and lots of unexpected moments.  Faith did play a big part in this story, the main characters in particular prayed when worried or hoping for a conclusion to the mystery.  For me that was a plus, it helped the characters center their emotions, and release some of the tension.  I look forward to reading about the other characters in this series.  Avery and Parker had some lovely moments that were touching and sweet as they got to know their deepest thoughts and feeling resurfaced for each other.

2249,"Short stories admittedly aren't my favorite thing to read. I often find they are anticlimactic or that they feel unfinished, and I cant help but have a difficult time pouring myself into a story that I know will end so quickly. But Adam Johnsons short story collection, Fortune Smiles, won the National Book Award, so I had a feeling I was in store for something special, and I was anything but disappointed.

The stories  distinctly melancholy, darkly funny, bleak and sometimes surreal  are thematically consistent: they're about lonely people facing extraordinary challenges.

In Nirvana, a mans wife has been stricken with Guillain-Barre syndrome, her entire body paralyzed for the past nine months. Struggling with his wifes illness and her threat of suicide, he develops a program that allows him to speak to the hologram of a recently deceased president, and takes solace in his new confidant.

In Hurricanes Anonymous, a directionless young father takes care of his son in post-Katrina New Orleans.

In Interesting Facts, the ghost of a woman who died of breast cancer visits her family and worries about her husband moving on.

In George Orwell Was a Friend of Mine, a former Stasi prison warden is in denial about the atrocities committed under his watch, and eerily attempts to justify and rationalize torture as a necessary part of a functioning society.

In Dark Meadows  perhaps one of the most harrowing and disturbing stories Ive ever read  a non-offending pedophile who himself was abused as a child helps the police track child pornography cases and finds himself looking after two neglected young girls in his neighborhood.

And finally, in Fortune Smiles, a man who defected from North Korea struggles to adapt to life in South Korea and dreams of returning to his home country.

The problem with many short story collections is that they are uneven. While some of the stories take hold of you, others are immediately forgettable. But with Fortune Smiles, almost every single story had me captivated  with the exception, perhaps, of Hurricanes Anonymous. If you enjoy short stories, don't miss this collection. And even if you typically dont, give it a try anyway.",3,"[-1.9228097004446223, -1.2765908003609536, -1.0809172771956364, -1.0164837872072114, -1.4031067828697177]",-1.0164837872072114

1155,"James Ellroy's taut, clipped phrases and lightning fast, head-spinning style is an acquired taste. When I first picked up L.A. Confidential, I hated it. His style just totally turned me off. After a few chapters, I was totally hooked. American Tabloid is more of the same...
  The book follows three men, Pete Bondurant, Ward Littell, and Kemper Boyd, through a maze of corruption, murder, and narcotics, eventually leading to the order to execute the President of the United States. I've always been interested in the conspiracy theories that surround the assassination of J.F.K., but I've never seen the Cuban/C.I.A./Mafia theory spelled out so thoroughly. The best way to describe reading this book is that it's like looking in a dirty toilet that's being flushed....All this filth is floating at the surface, and as it inexorably gets sucked down, it all mingles together before going down the pipes. The various fictional characters mingle with real-life figures such as J. Edgar Hoover, Jimmy Hoffa, L.B.J., John, Robert, and Joe Kennedy, and Fidel Castro, among others. Everyone in this book is crooked, and it's VERY entertaining watching Ellroy juggle dozens of different subplots and characters, heading them all in totally unexpected directions. A must-read for fans of hard-boiled crime epics.
  My only beef is the same one I had with L.A. Confidential: L.A. Confidential was the third book in a four book series, and American Tabloid is the follow-up to those books. I still haven't read the other L.A. books, so there were times in Tabloid that I felt that I had missed someting.

Val McDermid brings us face to face with some disturbing issues in her book A Place of Execution.  A child's disappearance is always unsettling and McDermid's novel about  young Allison Carter vanishing from the closed community of Scardale is most disturbing. McDermid's tale is one which brings to light questions of justice and vengeance as well as providing the reader with a quality mystery story
Chief Inspector George Bennett and Detective Sergeant Tommy Clough join forces in their search for the missing 13 year-old.  Both men are interesting characters who have an innate sense of justice and a strong desire for Allison to be returned to those she loves.  The residents of the hamlet of Scardale, where young Allison is from seem determined to put obstacles in the way of the detectives.  All residents are related to each other and seem to know each other's business, but when the need to be truthful and honest is so vital they seem to be less than forthcoming.  This in itself is a mystery, because Allison is a well loved and valued member of the community.  It is odd that Scardale would be so distrustful of strangers as to disrupt the investigation.
While this book is a stand alone the team of George Bennett and Tommy Clough are an intriguing pair.  Bennett a young and inexperienced detective is sincere and idealistic in his goals.  George has a sympathy for the victim which is appealing and honest.  Tommy Clough is a seasoned veteran who seems impossible to fool and as such is a valuable asset to  George in his search for the truth in Scardale.

The book debuts on June 28, so you can run out and get yourself a copy, which, by the way, I highly recommend you do if crime novels are your genre of choice.

Missing, Presumed by Susie Steiner is a story that begins with 24 year old graduate student, Edith Hind gone and there are possible signs of a struggle and traces of blood, which causes the situation to be treated as murder. Each chapter of the story is written from the perspective of one of the main characters, which allows readers to learn more of their lives and their personalities.. The front door is open and she seems to have vanished into thin air.  Edith's parents and boyfriend are frantic, and the police immediately realize that this is going to be a big deal due to the people involved in the possible crime.

Manon Bradshaw is a very compelling and devoted member of the Cambridgeshire police. Detective Sergeant Bradshaw is obsessed with her job to the detriment of her personal life. She's also a very fascinating woman who believes in smelling men so she can discern their good and bad points.  She's one of those women who ""puts out"" on the first date just to know if a second date is forthcoming.  Manon has ambivalence in most areas of her life and she is definitely far from perfect. While she wants to get involved, she's not a fan of most people which makes it hard. I think these characteristics make her more human and readers can connect with her as a character.

""Suspenseful and keenly observed, Missing, Presumed is a brilliantly twisting novel of how we seek connection, grant forgiveness, and reveal the truth about who we are.""

While this is a crime novel, it's also about every form of the word ""family"" - whether that's biological, marital or otherwise. More importantly, the story is about bonds, connections and ties between others. The story is tightly plotted and intensely addictive. The story has a slow moving - but very engaging - plot that is very realistic and believable.  Missing, Presumed is recommended for those readers who really enjoy literary mystery reading.

But he can also admit that he is a bit envious that his friends are finding their happy-ever-afters now when his never materialized. Their team is trying to take down a Russian syndicate that for several reasons has also become personal for them.

Amy Murray is an FBI agent who has a personal stake in trying to help find missing women.  She is highly intelligent, motivated, brave, caring, and understanding. She has been through several situations that have left their mark on her and shaped the woman she is now. She is determined to go undercover in a casino and use all of her skills to help infiltrate this crime ring.

And that means working with Eagle Securities and Cabe. When they are partnered up there is surprising sexual tension and attraction. The lonely man who has not been interested in anyone in years is having a hard time ignoring the pull. He is beginning to feel alive again, and he has a strong need to keep her safe. And the woman determined to stay away from impropriety at work is having just as hard a time avoiding it. Their plan is to try to stay professional at least until the op is over. But that will be challenged by adrenaline, fear, and his need to watch out for her. I really liked both of these two characters. They both had demons to deal with along with the job at hand, but were tenacious and could appreciate the other.

It's duty versus lust and love. Can he protect her yet still let her do the job she was trained for?

This has suspense, danger, steam, and emotion. There are plenty of layers built into the mission and the casino vibe gives it a different feel. It ties up the progressive story arc from the first two books and brings back the other couples Six and Lou, and Mac and Delaney.

  It is truly shocking to think that there are actually people still behaving as though we still have slavery and hating people of different races, cultures, religions, and sexual orientation.  It is also shocking that these racist people hate enough to hurt and kill to express their hatred.  Jodi did bring attention to issues that we are still dealing with and need desperately to end.

Before I Go To Sleep is S.J. Watson's first novel. I can't believe someone would take on such a theme for their first, being that the writing requires so much, but Mr. Watson did a great job! Before I Go To Sleep is about 47-year-old Cristine ""Crissy"" Lucas who suffered an accident in her twenties that caused severe retrograde and anterograde amnesia. ""Each morning, her husband has to tell her who she is, who he is, and so on. And each morning, after he leaves for work, she receives a phone call and is prompted by a doctor to retrieve her secret journal. There, she discovers increasingly frightening inconsistencies in the stories that her husband tells her--and in what the doctor says."" This psychological thriller is written in the first person from Cristine's perspective. I really liked this story. It was a bit slow for my taste but I think it had to do with the subject. Cristine has to start her life over every day, and the reader is reading her journal entries along with her and is basically just as confused as she is while she is trying to interpret her written experiences and distinguish what is true and who to trust.

This story is coming to the big screen in 2014 starring Nicole Kidman, Mark Strong, and Colin Firth.

2776,"I love having my own personal Christmas every day of the year!  Perhaps that comes from having limited resources available for presents when I was a child.  Or perhaps it's because I am an inveterate reader who looks at each new book as a present that you discover simply by opening the book cover.  Like Forrest Gump said ""Mama said that life was like a box of chocolates.  You never know what you're gonna get.""  And so it is with new books.

The Amazon Vine program has provided me with exposure to several new authors over the years, most of them pretty average as far as writing skills and telling a story.  On occasion a new star is discovered who immediately captivates you with his writing style, story-telling ability, and an imagination that provides a markedly different approach.  Such is the case with Spencer Kope's new novel ""Collecting The Dead"".  I noticed that Spencer has published a few earlier books that received little notoriety.  His new novel should dramatically change that perspective.

If you enjoy reading about imperfect heroes who are able to overcome their short-comings and put their unique talents to good use, you will enjoy ""Collecting The Dead"".  In a nutshell, this story is about Magnus (""call me Steps"") Craig, an FBI tracker who uses a special talent to locate and capture serial killers.  Unfortunately part of his job is to also locate the killer's victims and bring them back, dead or alive, to their families.  Hence the title of this novel.  As his unit members constantly remind themselves: ""we save the ones we can"".

Having not read any of Spencer Kope's previous works, I can't comment on how his writing skills have developed.  I can say however that he has now provided us with a fast-paced and engaging novel with an interesting new approach.  His story grabs you by the throat at the very beginning and then takes you on a dark thrill ride as you become embedded with his unit.  If you have ever visited Disney World and ridden on Magic Mountain, you will recognize the feeling of hurtling through the dark at breakneck speeds, not knowing what twists and turns lie ahead, only that things can get much worse before they get better.

Taught writing, black humor, witty banter, sarcastic comments, innocent victims, and dark monsters somehow inhabiting human form as they go about their dark and terrible deeds destroying human lives and rending families apart.  This novel will be a tough act to follow.",3,"[-1.9524512232574105, -1.4910628707679932, -1.0680213701779286, -1.0177203207772452, -1.0826367741309795]",-1.0177203207772452

A really enjoyable book, a bit short as i managed to read it in one day but Saxon and Tee relationship was fun to read about.

Saxon was Tee's best friends boyfriend until he cheated on her. Now Tee's best friend Lexi is finally one good terms with Saxon and is now seeing a guy named Ryder. Complicated part is Ryder and Saxon are both in the same band that has become really big and have been touring. Tee won't admit that she's attractive to Saxon and seems to still hate him for what he put her best friend through. Saxon wants Tee in a big way and vows to her that he will get her to trust him and break the friend barrier. It is hard with Saxon on the road touring has Tee has to trust him and believe that he does want her and won't cheat on her. It's a battle that gets put to the test on many occasions throughout the book.

I do wish that Saxon had to try a bit harder to get her as it seemed to not last long. I love the suspense of will they, won't they but it sort of didn't take long for her defenses to come down and for her to let him in. It was enjoyable to read and i am looking forward to reading more from Chantal Fernando.",3,"[-3.3056620878987477, -1.8515948708831231, -1.3649800827694585, -1.017975844219567, -1.1188964575443834]",-1.017975844219567

94,"The School of Good and Evil is an interesting book - what is essentially a riff on fairytales ends up being a straight adventure story lacking any of the morals upon which it is based; as such, it ends without making a point and contradicting itself and the characters throughout. Less demanding readers will read it as a simple tween romp and enjoy it as such. But more demanding readers may be frustrated by the lack of point of view by the author.

Story: Agatha and Sophie live in an isolated village in the middle of a forest. Every year, the 'headmaster' of the School for Good and Evil comes and takes two children in the night to be students in his school.  Sophie eagerly wants to go: she's sure she'll be a fairy tale princess.  Down to Earth Agatha, however, finds the whole thing pathetic. When both girls are taken to the school, Sophie ends up in the school for evil (to be a witch) and Agatha lands in the school for princesses. With both girls sure they are in the wrong place, how will they survive their schoolmates long enough to get back to their village?

Most of the book is a fish-out-of-water story of each girl dealing with the horrors of their situation: beautiful Sophie with the farting/warted/dowdy evils and grounded Agatha dealing with the vain and superficial princesses.  There should be a lot to mine here and a lot to be said about not falling into the cliches of either group. But somehow nothing is really said - is Sophie evil in her heart? Is Agatha really purely good despite her frogs and antisocial behavior? Are the princesses, with the callous and selfishness, really good? And are the evils really born that way or made so through cruel treatment?  The answer ends up muddled in each of those situations as the story mostly concerns Agatha trying to get home and Sophie stymieing her.  Even a point that neither is wholly good or wholly evil fails to materialize in this muddled plot.

In listening to this Audible version (in which the narrator did an excellent job), I kept feeling like there was going to be something deeper than the shallow story on top.

This novel does not come up to Jar City,  The Draining Lake, or Voices.  Its premise is interesting - the stabbing murder of Elias, a young half-Thai boy that might have been racially motivated.  As Detective Erlandur of the Reykjavik Police investigates this heinous act, he talks to Elias's schoolmates, teachers, neighbors and family.  There is plenty of racism and the case is complicated by other extraneous matters.  Included in the list of possible culprits is a pedophile who tries to lead Erlandur on a different trail, one that follows his own step-father who he calls a monster.

Erlandur is still reading his missing persons books, stories of people who disappeared into the Icelandic wilderness.  Never having overcome the death of his brother, Erlandur soothes himself by reading tales of the disappeared, some of whom have come to a better end than his brother who disappeared without leaving any trace.

Erlandur is also dealing with the impending death of Marion Briem, his mentor and first supervisor when he entered the police force.  As in previous novels of this series, Marion is sharp as a tack even on her deathbed and the reader never finds out Marion's gender.

This novel gives the reader great insight into the new Icelandic society as it deals with issues of multiculturalism and xenophobia, wanting to keep Iceland's heritage as it was and lily white.

I am not sure if all of his novels read this way or not, but for me, this read like watching one of the more recent Christian films being made (ex. Fireproof or Courageous).  I found it to be interesting and heartfelt, and had no difficulty zipping right through it.

Chapin, tackles some difficult and often over looked subject matter. In general, most romance novels are about couples dating, and on occasion you stumble into one where the couple is already married. I found this to be interesting, as it is written from a male's perspective and deals with the issues of a troubled marriage, floundering faith, forgiveness, restoration and a few other matters I won't list because I don't want to spoil it for you.

The characters are written realistically, their faults displayed but also their journey to mature and draw closer to God. Now, while I found all the sage advice to be true, some may find it a little too preachy or such. I think it will be a matter of opinion. Still, as I said, I raced through the story and enjoyed the journey.

825,"We all know what became of Anne Boleyn, the second wife of Henry VIII, but what about others in the court?  This novel gives readers a look at that viewpoint.

Margaret (aka Madge or ""Pretty Madge"") is fifteen years old when she comes to court to become a lady in waiting for her cousin, Anne Boleyn.  She lives there for three years and sees the king's affections toward her cousin Anne wax and wane.  She assists in the birth of Princess Elizabeth and two stillborn sons.  Madge becomes, at Anne's behest, involved in a scheme to help Anne keep the King's affections and keep him away from ""Plain Jane"" Seymour.  Warning:  Some things involved in this scheme -- things that Anne orders Madge to try -- are described in explicit detail, as are Henry's conjugal difficulties.

Readers see some of Madge's own problems, too, besides the court intrigue. Madge falls in love with one of the young men at court, but another man wants her and has royal approval to pursue and marry her.

Readers do see plenty of the historical figures -- Cardinal Wolsley, Thomas Cromwell, and many more -- and the religious turmoil of the times.

Barnhill creates a good story, but the strong sexuality at times keeps me from giving it a five rating as a warning to other readers.",3,"[-1.9233181842779836, -1.877912863706992, -1.0329773183876878, -1.0190640013358834, -1.4403841015985903]",-1.0190640013358834

New Beginnings
Others of Edenton 0.5

Having read (and fallen in love with) In Too Deep, I couldn't wait to start reading this book. Taking place 2 years before In Too Deep, this is the story of Jess and Slater. Firstly, how do I move to Edenton? It sounds too good to be true, with all the sexy hunks living there (Brody still holds my heart, but Slater is a close second now).

Every character has its place, and no matter how large or small their part in the story, none seem like background characters. There is a realistic aspect to the story, and reading about Jess' mistakes in her past and how she ended up in Edenton was well written (and will possibly remind you of parts of your own lives!) I have no idea how Jess deals with being a psychic, why would you do anything if you knew it was going to end badly? Despite this, she lives her life best she can, and won't let anything get in her way when she sets her sights on something. Slater is a strong alpha, and cares deeply about his entire pack, no matter how crazy or insane they seem. They both go through an emotional roller coaster of a ride, it would be boring if it went straight to happily ever after, but they finally realise what they could have if they both let it happen. Highly recommend this series to all paranormal romance lovers.

454,"At the core of this book is a great story about Harry Morgan.  Despite his racism and misogyny, he is, much like Hemingway himself, ultimately a sympathetic character.  We want him to succeed given the force of his will and the odds against him.  Also, despite his tough talk, and sometimes equally tough deeds, Morgan wants to do well for his family and wants to help out the dispossessed.

Unfortunately, Hemingway felt the need to write a novel rather than a short story, and the story suffers in the process.  He experiments with shifting points of view and interior monologues -- almost like he wants to show the world he can beat Joyce and Faulkner at their own game.  Worse still, he shifts the story away from Morgan to a collection of ""haves"" who are not sufficiently developed, believable, or sympathetic.  Again, one gets the sense that Hemingway is experimenting with another writer's style (in this case Fitzgerald), but does not quite bring it off.

The one passage I remember from reading the book over 30 years ago is the epiphany experienced by Morgan's wife when he sees Harry ride away -- capturing both the strength and the hopelessness of Harry's character.  This passage is one of the best Hemingway ever wrote.  It and the basic story of Morgan make the book worthwhile.

It is ironic that this book received so much criticism.  It is much better than the ""Old Man and the Sea"", for which Hemingway won awards.  The theme of individual's struggle against forces much larger than himself is much better told in this book than in Hemingway's later work.",3,"[-3.8769890062059726, -1.6089228838058847, -1.041000475582907, -1.0196663943331152, -1.3672875174885197]",-1.0196663943331152

I have been ready and reeling to get my grubby little hands on one of these books since hearing about the Wild Card, the first book in the North Ridge series. Unfortunately, I haven't read that book as of yet, but I totally will now that I have read this gem!
John ""Maverick"" Nelson is the head of North Ridge S&R team and he needs to hire a new member that is either a minority or a woman. So, he hires Riley Clarke, who is a new resident of British Columbia, Canada trying to start life anew. Unfortunately, there is an instant connection between the two that could make their working situation quite sticky with the no fraternization policy.
Riley is fun, outgoing, courageous, but she is still trying to overcome the aftermath of a past S&R mission gone wrong and losing a loved love. But she isn't looking for a relationship when the obvious connection between Maverick and herself makes itself known and grows through training, missions, and their time together.
Even though this is my first read from Karina Halle, I loved her use of dual POVs for Riley and Maverick, her detail in the S&R line of work made is so realistic, and the sensual encounters between these two... WOWZERS!

We've heard the stories about the legendary Daratrazanoff twins, Gabriel and Lucian. Gregori's older brothers were great fighters and protectors of the Carpathian people. Everyone has believed them dead for centuries, but they've really been locked beneath the earth all this time.

The brothers made a pact early on that should either one become a vampire, the remaining sibling would take his life. When Lucian began to show all the tell-tale signs that he had succumbed, Gabriel tried to keep his promise. The two clashed over and over again, with neither emerging the victor... until Gabriel tricked his brother and bound them together underground.

A disturbance awakens the twins in modern-day Paris. Shortly after rising to the surface, Gabriel meets Francesca, his lifemate. It turns out that she's lived hundreds of years without him... convinced he sacrificed their chance at happiness to be a guardian for his people. Now he must break through the walls she has built around herself and convince her that they are meant to live together as one.

Francesca isn't your average Carpathian heroine. For one, she's already Carpathian. Two, she herself is an ancient. She is powerful in her own ways, as well as resourceful and determined. She has suffered in Gabriel's absence all these years... but at the same time, so has Gabriel. He is, of course, a bossy, alpha, Carpathian male. But at least he values her mind and her gifts; he cares about her feelings; and feels real guilt for the way his actions have impacted her life.

I really enjoyed the twin dynamic between Gabriel and Lucien. Unlike Aidan and Julian, these two have a tangible connection. And the addition of young Skylar to the family, touches a real chord. Already, Feehan is laying the foundation for that one day love story between her and Dimitri... you know, the one I'll get to read before I collect Social Security... or maybe not.

I was pretty intrigued with the synopsis and I have to say the story kind of grabs you right from the first page. The concept, a company who uses girls with special powers to do their bidding, is pretty cool in itself, and I really liked how White laid it all out. What's even more, I was really drawn to the characters, especially Fia.

I think what I liked most about this was the relationship between Fia and Annie. From beginning to end, their love and loyalty to each other was incomparable. Yes, they had some selfish moments and their circumstances definitely put some strains on their relationship, but their bond was strong and I really appreciated that aspect of the book. Annie is basically the innocent, naive, ""weak"" one and I didn't really like her most of the time, but she has her moments. I think she became a stronger and more likable character as the story progresses, whereas I really liked Fia from the start. She's kind of wild and crazy, but after everything they put her through, it's understandable, and also, necessary. Fia is such a strong, determined, fierce female character and I loved being inside her head. Oh, there was one scene where Fia does something CRAZY in order to protect Annie that totally shocked me.

Oh, and that ending?! Brillant! I kind of saw it coming, but not until right before it happened. And I loved it!

The whole concept of this book - trying to find the girl who you wished you had the guts to approach in ""that way"" in high school to see if the spark is still there.

Enter Coop, very handsome and sexy ""cowboy"" and Julia a beautiful young lawyer.... when they were in High School, Julia thought Coop had a thing for her identical twin sister so her shock in receiving a mysterious invite to a Dude Ranch for a week took her by surprise. Her dilemma on whether to attend or not continued until she actually arrived at the Ranch.

The chemistry between Coop and Julia is swoon worthy. Both of them have grown into themselves over the last several years allowing them to explore the feelings they've had for each other all these years.

The setting of the Ranch is beautiful, tranquil and relaxing opening Julia's eyes to both Coop and what's possible in her life. And what she sees excites. Adding Coop into the deal and you can only imagine how hot and steamy these two will be together if they can manage to get out of their own way. The steaminess factor between our H/h is enough to fog up your windows!

Can Coop and Julia overcome what they perceive the other wants both from their partner and in their lives?

All of Dan Waslshs books are the type that you cant put down, and this book was no different. When Doug Anderson goes to college, he begins to fall away from his family and the faith that had been a part of his life growing up. Dougs friend Christina went through a similar situation in the past, and she is trying to help him leave behind the bad environment he got himself into.

I enjoyed reading about the Anderson family again, and Doug was a really interesting character to read about. Although I didn't face the same type of temptation he did when he went to college, I think it was interesting to read about the struggles some people face when leaving their families so I can better understand and empathize with them. Im sad to see this series end, and I would definitely recommend it to someone who is looking for a new book series to enjoy.

2988,"This was a fascinating story that I did not want to put down!  I loved the character of Erin, a follower of God but very attracted to Adam, an unbeliever.  She was strong and sassy and gave Adam a run for his money.  I liked Adam, too, but it was a little frustrating to see some of the choices he made, especially when he was felt he could run his own life better than God could.  Faith and the power of prayer were very important elements in the story and they were done very well.  I liked the discussions Erin and Adam would have about God and I especially liked Erin's struggle to be obedient, no matter the cost.  It was fascinating to learn about the Navajo culture and so sad to read about what many of them endured at the hands of the government, especially taking away their children to go to mission schools.  This fact was what led Erin there in the first place and I loved the sections that focused on the woman Erin's trying to track down.  I like stories with a mix of contemporary and historical elements.  I appreciated a look into a culture I'm not very familiar with and I'm glad to see more stories being published about Native Americans in the Christian market.  I really liked the other characters, too, and felt they added much to the story.  The romance was fun and their banter amusing.

Yes, Autumn takes place in Britain in the fall of 2016, exactly four months after the devastating June 23 referendum.  Elisabeth, an art historian, sits by the bedside of Daniel Gluck, the only man she has ever truly loved despite the 70 or so years' difference in their ages.  The narrative securely anchors the reader by providing the date and Elisabeth's age at the time, as it weaves in and out of her story.

Next, there is so much to chew on, not the least an introduction (at least to this reader) of Pauline Boty - the only female pop artist of the '60's, dying tragically young and leaving an astounding body of work which has for the most part disappeared.

The Duke of Griffin is a honorable and responsible Nobleman who looks after his twin sisters, his extended family and everyone and everything in his purview.  He was not always a responsible Duke.  When he was younger he caroused with his friends.  Wine, Woman, Gambling, reckless wagers and mischief. The wager that he and his friends made brought ruin and scandal to the young ladies that debuted that year.  He and his fellow Dukes have never been able to live down the wager.  Someone is spreading rumors that his twin sisters should suffer for what he did years ago.

Esmeralda Swift runs an employment agency for governesses.  She takes care of her younger sister and barely makes ends meet.  The Duke of Griffin walks into the agency and demands that she be his sisters chaperone for the coming season.  They are instantly attracted to each other. The sensual pull between them is intense. He has never been this obsessed with a woman before.  She is off limits because she is in his employ.

The connection that forms between Griffin and Esmeralda is wonderful and is the core of this story.  Amelia's writing is witty and charming.  I smiled throughout this book.  I loved Esmeralda's little sister Josephine and her dog Napoleon who will make you laugh out loud.  This is also a emotionally fulfilling love story that brought me to tears.

Hicks writes about the people and times of New Orleans in the late 1870s with great description. I got a sense of the pain and suffering that Hood must have gone through after the war. Hicks (the author) does a great job weaving the story together as the journals/ledgers from Hood and his family are read by someone Hood trusts and the reader begins to put the pieces together of Hood's life.

It's a bit long and historical fiction is not my favorite genre, but Hicks does a good job giving real substance to a Confederate General who tried to live a normal life after the tragic wounds that he suffered.

Victor struggles with Alcoholism after his time spent fighting in WWI and Nadine attempts to keep her family together as she tries to deal with the various familial relationships in her life. Their oldest and youngest daughters seem to be insulated from the problems their family is experiencing while Kate, their middle daughter, tries to help keep her family together.

In addition to Kate taking care of her family, she becomes the protector of Lorena Birdsong, a young girls who is abandoned by her family because they do not have the means to care for her. As Lorena's place in the small community is being questioned, Kate and her parents must face past relationships with their families. Nadine's father, a pastor in the community, does not feel as if Lorena should be raised by the Merritt family so he designs a plan to have her placed within another home. Victor's father, Preston Merritt, has never forgiven himself for the death of his other son, and he places that anger upon Victor.

Through the Merritt's attempts to return Lorena to their home, they begin to face what went wrong in their pasts and how they can rectify those situations. It's clear through the pages that the Merritt's have a strong relationship with God, and this relationship is what allows them to get through the difficult times in their lives and begin to forgive one another for past mistakes.

We gain insight into Isaac also as the event of his childhood where his father Abraham almost sacrificed him deeply affected his relationships with his mother and father and ultimately with Rebekah and their sons Jacob and Esau.  Ultimately, we come to understand how Rebekah could have deceived her husband in order for Jacob to get the blessing instead of Esau.

I really enjoyed the insight into Rebekah's life.  I came to understand her and Isaac's choices and how a person can get so focused on being right that it consumes them at the expense of others.

I like cozies as a break after some of the heavier books I read and this really fit that space nicely!  The author has a formula here that works well for me: a bit of the paranormal, but not too much; close family; pets that aid in the crime solving; setting in an Eastern coast vacation town. There are four sisters who really care for each other and each is unique in her ""paranormal"" gifts (although not all of them are developed yet in this book). Angie has inherited a Victorian mansion where her sister Ellie has set up a B&B.

As with most Americans of a certain age I have vivid memories of November 22, 1963 (I was six, by the way)and the terrible days that followed President Kennedy's assassination.  Before, during and now after  my career as a high school history teacher I frequently fantasized about a time machine, a  way to return to the past to observe and perhaps change pivotal events.  I've read a number of wonderful books about time travel, and I have to rate King's newest effort among the best of them.

Jake is a high school English teacher in Maine in 2011.  Essentially rootless and feeling adrift, he learns of and is deeply touched by stories of old tragedies affecting people he knows.  Then he meets Al, a man with a secret: access to 1958 through a wormhole or bubble.  He makes a few trips back into time, eventually making efforts to prevent some of the local tragedies with which he is familiar.  Then Al assigns him another task: return to 1958 and spend the next five years working to prevent JFK's assassination.  Jake accepts the challenge, but he finds unexpected twists and turns that complicate an already difficult job.

King's depictions of the modern world and that of the late 50s and early 60s are fascinating and colorful.  The suspense is never ending and immeasurably enhanced by the vast amount of research he undertook to ensure historical accuracy.

This is my first paranormal romance starring a werewolf. Logan Black is a former Marine and werewolf hired by his best friend, Jake, to protect human wedding planner Veronica Vale. Veronica is the younger sister of Leah, who is engaged to marry Jake.

Veronica has been receiving letters from a secret admirer who also happens to be a werewolf. She isn't a fan of werewolves. In fact, her sister was attacked by a werewolf about a year ago and is now a werewolf herself. Veronica loves her sister but she despises any other werewolf even though her sister is marrying one.

Logan's job is to protect Veronica from a distance but that doesn't work out so well. His attraction to her causes him to get much closer than he expected. Their relationship heats up and he doesn't get the opportunity to tell her that he is also a werewolf. Veronica's interactions with Logan and other pack members help to change her perspective regarding werewolves and she has to do some soul searching of her own. Ultimately, her journey becomes a lesson in love and the age old issues about judging a book by it's cover. I really enjoyed the book. It is part of a series but definitely stands alone.

2982,"The book is told in alternating timelines and I think it was necessary to fully grasp the story and Sophies journey in unraveling this mystery. Sharpe only highlights key points in Sophies life that are essential to the story and I appreciated how seamlessly she weaved both timelines into one cohesive read. A lot of times, I get irritated with alternating timelines because it just isn't done well, at least in my opinion, but Sharpe does a great job at this. I was kept engaged with these characters, especially Sophie, the whole time I was reading and I never felt bored or that any part of the story was meaningless.

There was a bit of a twist that I didn't expect right away from Sophie and Mina, but Sharpe leaves subtle clues throughout the book for you to pick up on and I liked the way it all played out. I really enjoyed being in Sophies head, getting to understand her inner struggles with finding out who Minas murderer is and battling with her addiction to pain killers. I really felt for Sophie, especially considering how everyone was against her, and internally praised her for fighting so hard for her friend. When the mystery finally reveals itself, it wasn't what I thought at all, and it kind of made me sad how things ended for Mina. The ending is far from happy, but it fit with this storyline and definitely leaves you feeling content.

Far From You is full of surprises and twists that will keep you glued to the pages wanting to know what happens next. I think readers of all kinds will enjoy this book, but especially those who love a good mystery. Sharpe tackles so many important and emotional topics in this book, it definitely surprised me with how well she executed most of it.

A you woman was tormented every day by a peer of hers. Now, years later, the meet again. This time, he has changed his name and appearance. But something about him is different.

Mercy has a difference that is visible to everyone's eyes. Her stump of a hand puts her on edge. She feels handicapped by it. When she was a girl, a boy made fun of her daily for her stump...yet she still survived. Now grown, Mercy is still struggling with her physical appearance. It went from a physical to an emotional handicap.

Aaron was a young boy who tormented others to make himself feel better. He knew what he was doing was wrong yet he still did it. His family life was awful and he thought others should not be happy if he wasn't. Now as a grown man, Aaron wants to apologize to all his peers and hope to make a difference in his students' lives. But Mercy might prevent that...and his past has a way of hindering him from his future happiness.

Together Mercy and Aaron have a long way to go. Both need to learn what is stopping them from being happy. Forgiveness is not just one sided. Each protagonist has suffered pain, loss, and trauma. But with some faith, friends, and new beginnings they might just find the peace they're looking for...

1331,"Betsy, Queen of the Vampires, is having a tough time. Her wedding is only three months away and she is unready. She's sure her friends are planning a surprise birthday party that she doesn't want--and hopes they will throw. When a visiting delegation of European vampires visit, it turns out that one of them was responsible for turning one of Betsy's vampire friends. What, exactly, is the penalty for a two-hundred year old murder? Especially if the victim is still around. Meanwhile, Betsy's friendly ghost keeps announcing that there's a zombie in the attic, Betsy's best friend is sick, and Betsy has decided to give up on sucking blood--causing all sorts of problems for her fiance/husband/king Eric Sinclair.

Author Mary Janice Davidson has followed Queen Betsy's progress through several novels now. The concept of a scatter-brained blonde becoming the Queen of the Vampires because she isn't subject to most vampire weaknesses is a strong one that generally creates interest. Romantic foil Eric Sinclair is tough enough to be sexy, yet completely fixated on satisfying Betsy's needs. That and he's a super-rich vampire--hard not to like that.

Davidson's breezy first-person narrative creates a strong flow, encouraging the reader to tackle just one more page, one more paragraph. Wide-spaced lines and plenty of white space ensure that even the most book-averse reader can make it through. Still, I was expecting more from this book. Generally, characters should change and grow in a novel. That really didn't happen here. Betsy's self-absorbtion is funny, but it does make her less sympathetic, and it became hard to really care about her problems--reducing the story conflict. I found the resolution to the problem of the European murderer unsatisfactory as it had nothing really to do with Betsy, and the whole zombie thing left me scratching my head trying to figure out what that was about and why I should care.

1224,"""Death. It doesn't have to be boring.""

Perhaps the above sentence, taken from the introduction to Mary Roach's ""Stiff"", is the best way to summarize this unusual book. While death has historically been a taboo subject - and still lends itself to a fair bit of squeamishness - it is no longer simply an end. After a person dies, his or her body can go through a variety of situations. Simply being buried is no longer the status quo, and in this bizarre yet informative look at the uses of human cadavers, Mary Roach explores what bodies have done - and can do - for us.

""Stiff"" is divided into twelve chapters, each dealing with a different ""use"" for the human body after an individual dies. Among the topics discussed are medicinal cannibalism, medical labs, bullet and bomb experiments, plane crashes, composting, body snatching, decapitation, organ transplantation, human crucifixion, and crash test dummies. Each chapter discusses not only how cadavers are currently used but also explores their past uses in that particular area, and it also seeks to explain why bodies are used in this manner.

While it may sound gruesome, it isn't. The book is full of interesting scientific information. For example, the damage done to the remains of plane crash victims can help explain what brought the aircraft down, and this science was used in the investigation of TWA Flight 800. Cadaver legs have been used to test footwear made for those who clear landmines, as they are about 1/10th the cost of artificial limbs. And there is a scientist in Sweden who is hoping to present the option of drying remains and turning them into compost as an eco-friendly alternative to cremation. These things are incredible, and while Roach has a definite sense of humor about many of the things she is writing, she never becomes disrespectful to the dead. It's obvious that she feels those who have donated their bodies have made a big impact on society.

""Stiff"" is a highly unusual book, but it's incredibly interesting. It's full of strangely hypnotic scientific facts, and there is no doubt it will be unlike anything you've read before!",3,"[-1.0280514987877085, -1.3202587897455098, -1.0339127473847265, -1.0236263386161637, -1.2056567213823424]",-1.0236263386161637

Holly becomes more dark and swallowed in misery while Sy starts to realize he needs and wants her. They have to slowly build to where they want to be and it definitely isn't a smooth ride but these two were made for each other and it was beautiful to watch unfold.

The story line in this book was fantastic. Everything flowed really well and was really easy to read. I loved the passion and emotion from Sy and Holly. Frankly, you might want to keep a fan handy because its hot! There is a lot going on with the club and the characters have a lot to overcome but they all come together and work through everything.

9139,"I enjoyed this book in the sense that it was about a horrifically abused woman who escaped her husband and subsequently found love again, even though she never thought that would happen.

Angel bore the scars on her body of her husband's wrath. Mentally beaten down to the point she felt ""less than"", she found her inner strong again when she realized she was pregnant and escaped with the help of her brother's MC. Determined to never ever be a victim again, Angel struggles to find who she is while learning how to defend herself with the club's SAA, Demon, a man that she had a one-nighter with not knowing who he was. Demon and Angel are drawn to one another, even as they both deal with the demons from their pasts.

As a survivor of DV (although not to the extent portrayed against Angel), I applaud the author for tackling such a tough subject. Not only did the female character's ""husband"" physically abuse and scar her, he mentally scarred her. Seeing a character grow and find love again was wonderful; I immediate one-clicked the second book in the series so I could finish the ""rest of the story"".",3,"[-1.6927065222330686, -1.9119666359967518, -1.2558058913462886, -1.0247753767413468, -1.0273818242679915]",-1.0247753767413468

Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau made a number of strong comedies together, and this one does not disappoint. Set as aging widower neighbors who haven't gotten along since they both loved the same girl in their youth (Lemmon's character Gustafson married her), the two feud, play pranks on each other, and exchange very funny barbed quips throughout the movie.

When widowed Ann-Margret (as beautiful as ever) moves in across the street, the old rivalry cooks up again. The irrepressibly vivacious woman puts some spice (or at least hopes of spice) back in their lives. Complicating matters are their kids. Matthau's son had a life long crush on Lemmon's daughter, and when she moves back in with Dad after separating from her husband, a second chance is at hand.

Burgess Meredith delights as Lemmon's father, in one of his last performances.

I really loved Josey and Will. They were both really quirky, and fun to read. You get invested in these two pretty quickly. Their relationship starts off very awkwardly. By the end, it blossoms into a tender and adorable romance.

Josey is very easy to like. Yes, obviously she has her own flaws, but overall she was an endearing character. She is a straight talker to the point of bluntness, socially awkward and funny. I found myself rooting for her, I adored her quirky personality.

Will is private, reserved and stoic, he also is considerate and sweet. Hes someone who puts others before him, and I loved that about him. His kindness, selflessness and generosity really made him an incredibly likeable hero. He is a famous athlete and the media is making him out to be a sexual deviant because he is into voyeurism. He needs a roommate to keep him on the straight and narrow, to keep him busy and distracted and it shows how lonely he is despite being a celebrity.

Without giving too much away I must say that I became totally enamored with these two and the time they spent together and the intimate moments they shared. They feel comfortable around one another.

It's been a long time since I read a Nero Wolfe by Rex Stout, but STOP THE PRESSES! fits right in with the Nero Wolfe series I watched fairly recently on A&E (starring Maury Chaykin as Nero Wolfe and Timothy Hutton as Archie Goodwin).

In this novel, a much-hated, much-read gossip columnist (modeled on Walter Winchell) informs his newspaper that he's been receiving seriously threatening telephone calls.  The columnist then supplies his editors (and Wolfe) with a short list of the five people who most want him dead.  Eventually the columnist's body is discovered--an apparent suicide, but with suspicious surrounding circumstances.  Naturally the newspaper's publisher and editors engage Wolfe to determine whether the death was murder or suicide.

Goodwin performs his usual magic in persuading the five ""suspects"" to show up at Wolfe's brownstone on successive evenings for private interviews.  Eventually Wolfe unravels the circumstances of the columnist's death, and then announces his conclusions at the customary gathering of suspects, clients, and police.

This is a short, fast, thoroughly enjoyable read for all Nero Wolfe fans.",3,"[-2.625584518266402, -1.7815865378403677, -1.0953615746093086, -1.0254109712503738, -1.0257322505536721]",-1.0254109712503738

239,"In the early 90's a group of high ranking officials from the Russian and American governments came together to form a highly classified initiative that could potentially lead to the death of millions of people. To ensure the security of the agreement, all involved parties sign a document that allows an international assassin to be ordered to eliminate anyone who leaks the information.

Fast forward to the present day, and the information has been stolen. With the threat of the horrific details of the plan being revealed, various entities begin to search for the documents, and the person who they believe could be responsible. Will Cochrane, an MI6 operative leads a team, in cooperation with the CIA, to attempt to find the man responsible for the missing papers. But the mission soon becomes far more personal. Someone has discovered Will's true identity, and threatens to release the information and to harm his sister, the only person on the earth who he truly cares about. The story quickly becomes an international tale of intrigue in which Will grapples with the implications of the released documents, faces the highly dangerous assassin, and attempts to discover the person or people who threaten to blow his cover.

The complexity of this novel makes it quite difficult to explain the plot without spoiling the twists and details that make it so compelling. Author Matthew Dunn is a former MI6 operative himself, so he brings a unique understanding of the inner workings of the secretive organizations that are explored in this book. This is the third novel to feature Will Cochrane, but the story itself stands alone as a completely realized narrative. It took me a bit of time to acclimate myself to all of the military jargon used throughout the novel, but the plot is intriguing enough that I was quickly able to work through it.

The character of Will Cochrane could have easily been a cold, one-dimensional man, especially given the secretive nature of his work. Where Dunn really excels is in extracting the emotions of this man who has essentially been trained to show none. It was fascinating to read about Will's internal battle of dealing with his inner feelings while never letting them betray the complex mission at hand. Overall, this is a fast paced, complex, international conspiracy novel that easily sets itself as a top example of the genre. Dunn is able to successfully combine his own personal experience as an MI6 operative with the conventions of modern thriller novels to create a unique and nearly flawless book.",3,"[-1.9387479288726828, -1.2611351730198013, -1.0810761495209973, -1.026176899684358, -1.1624176462363722]",-1.026176899684358

9329,"Who knew Owen Wilson could write?  I sure didn't, but then I stumbled upon the comedic masterpiece known as `The Royal Tenenbaums' and I was quickly put in my place.  With fantastic work by the entire cast, this film succeeds in becoming a smart, witty and deep comedy that far surpasses what passes today as a good laugh.

Gene Hackman does a brilliant job as Royal, prick-father to three genius yet dysfunctional children who decides he wants to make peace with his family and become the father he never was.  His children are splendidly played by Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson and Gwyneth Paltrow.

Stiller plays Chas, the athletic financier who buries himself in work to avoid confronting the death of his wife.  He's slowly becoming the father he always hated to his two sons yet he won't accept that and thus refuses to accept his fathers attempt to reconcile.  Wilson plays Richie, the tennis star who hit a slump after his adopted sister Margot marries Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray) and thus becomes somewhat of a hermit.  Paltrow plays Margot, the playwright who's estranged from her family and quite the downer.  Together with their mother Etheline (Anjelica Huston) they make up one of the most eccentric families the screen has ever seen, but they are certainly one of the most entertaining.

Along with his sidekick Pagoda (the hilarious Kumar Pallana), Royal tries his hardest to reach his families hearts, albeit going about it in all the wrong ways, but he must contend with Henry Sherman (Danny Glover), Etheline's fianc, who is determined to make his efforts fail.  With brilliant performances by the entire cast (Hackman, Paltrow and Stiller stealing most of the show) and a hilarious car crash scene involving family friend Eli Cash (Owen Wilson) that had me reeling, `The Royal Tenenbaums' is a unique comedy that is sure to please and be remembered for time to come.  There aren't many comedies like this one, and that makes it all the more special.",3,"[-4.26310339178887, -2.366143969748648, -1.122135716391164, -1.0276249205508043, -1.2521130122192308]",-1.0276249205508043
785,"As a dedicated fan of MC Beaton, I loved Deadly Dance.  Agatha shrewdly moves into creating her own detective agency and manages to turn a profit in spite of herself.

As always, readers have fun reuniting with the cast of characters -- the vicar's wife, the town policeman, the cats and more -- and watching Agatha Raisin in action. I love having a middle-aged heroine who combines acute business sense with a misguided view of human nature. She's so real and Beaton manages to convey complex emotion in a light-hearted Cotswold romp -- not an easy feat.

The plot seemed a little more twisted this time and I had trouble accepting Agatha's flirtation with someone who's obviously destined for villain status.  And while all of the characters are foils for Agatha, one female character turns out to be a little too much like the heroine herself -- a darker and nastier version, to be sure, but sharing Agatha's penchant for impossible crushes on unreachable men.

Agatha needs to play against a strong character, like James Lacey, or compete against a truly interesting villain.

But not to worry -- I absolutely love Agatha Raisin and hope she doesn't give up on the detective agency.  Like most professionals who retired too soon, she needs a new career!",3,"[-2.398373549130608, -1.4387654743533975, -1.0965472207472227, -1.0277553334188874, -1.056896745954595]",-1.0277553334188874

Barbara Cameron, in this second novel of her Stitches in Time series puts these thoughts to rest. Not only do they have the same problems we do, for the most part, but maybe more as we are usually more free to be individuals, nor are we as able to 'hide' behind our parents and siblings. Certainly, some of their difficulties are different than ours, but underneath all of that, there is a common thread. We want to be loved and accepted. As we travel with Leah and Noami we see the growth in Noami as she strives to become a wise woman like her grandmother.
Barbara has an affinity with the Amish, and this comes out in her delightful stories. Together with her we see behind the story, the things thought in secret.. I enjoyed taking the 'min' vacation to Florida with Leah and Noami and though I feel I have been there now that I read this book, felt the white sand between my toes, learnt to know others at Sarasota.
Although this is the second novel in the series it is a stand alone book. However, I am sure you will enjoy both titles, and together with me wait for the next one.

5832,"This book was a surprise - I didn't expect to enjoy it 5-Stars worth, but I did!  I read mysteries almost exclusively, and I am getting used to many of the story patterns, but this book gave me a few new twists.  I'm also used to ""detectives"" being in almost every profession, but never encountered one like Allison, an image consultant. And the other characters bring a lot of depth and interest.  I love the support group ladies!  The strain between Allison and her sister is quite believable, and her office assistant, Vaughn and especially his brother Jamie, all contribute well to the flow of the plot.

The book starts off with a murder .... even before we meet Allison, so the author wastes no time in getting her readers to the action.  Then, we meet Allison on the job, being approached by a shady politician with an upcoming election; he wants Allison to do a ""make-over"" on his rebellious daughter, Maggie - a difficult teen - so she won't deter his voter popularity.  Although Allison normally does not work with child clients, she accepts this challenge and the tumultuous interaction between Maggie and Allison begins.  Allison starts to see beneath Maggie's faade and wants to help her, especially when crime evidence starts pointing in Maggie's direction.

I notice that some have said that this book is ""dark and psychological.""  I would not call this a psychological mystery, and it is not THAT dark either - although, of course, you can't have a mystery without a dead body or two.  And for good measure, the author tosses in a few red herrings to challenge the reader.

I'd say this book forms the start of an excellent series, with the author bringing the cast aboard and showing how an image consultant could encounter situations leading to the need for some amateur sleuthing.

Not surprisingly, her exploration of the paranormal turns up a lot of lack of evidence. I was not familiar with things like ectoplasm, near-death experiences, and attempts to capture ghosts with cameras and tape recorders, so I was fascinated by the foray into people's efforts over the centuries to find (or fake) evidence of the afterlife.

Although in many ways quite the same. Each woman is fighting for her rights in the best way she can for the era she lives in.

The one common goal that can help each of them is a contest that took place in the 1940s to 1970s called Miss Subways. This is an actual competition that occurred in New York City during that time frame and its incorporated into this fictionalized story.  The author does a wonderful job of mixing actual history with fiction.

As a native New Yorker, I was immediately interested in this book. Who doesnt enjoy books set in their hometown? To make it even more enticing to me is that both girls are from Brooklyn, which Im from as well. I could easily transport myself right into the middle of it all.

I never read anything by Susie Orman Schnall before, but this book won me over. The characters are vividly portrayed and leap right out of the pages. The author paints a realistic portrayal of New York.

This book has everything from drama, romance, and even a couple of eye-opening twists. I knew some surprises were coming, but I wasn't quite sure how it all would work out.  It tugs at your heartstrings.  My eyes were blurred with tears by the end.  I can't say enough good things about this book.

Even though it was a departure from the authors norm of contemporary fiction, this historical fiction was completely riveting.  I also learned things about Roman society that I never knew before and I loved how Mr. Singer even treated some known facts with humor.

Essentially, Mr. Singer has written a book with the idea that Luke and Acts sound like legal briefs  would it be possible that they were written to a lawyer, Theophilus, to get him caught up to date to prepare for Pauls trial before Nero?  So we get the story of Paul woven in the book, but also the fictional parts about Theophilus and how he fit in Roman society.  Of course Mr. Singer has done extensive research into Roman society to bring many details to life  from the vestal virgins to the gladiator games to the problems in outlaying provinces.  We even get an understanding for why Pontius Pilate acted as he did.

He has made a list of all the things he want to do before he dies and that means traveling back to Willow Lake and Camp Kioga.  He hires a private nurse and sets out on his way.

Meanwhile, George's grandson, Ross is returning home from Afghanistan as  he has completed his tour of duty and the whole family is counting on him to ""talk sense"" to his grandfather and get him to return home for treatment.  When he reaches Camp Kioga and talks to his grandfather, Claire the nurse and reviews his grandfather's medical reports, even talks to some doctors after a trip to the emergency room for George, he realizes he has to bend to his grandfather's wishes.

One of the first things George wants to do is reunite with a brother he has not seen in 55 years, then he also wants to skydive, ride a Harley, and have a big family reunion.  As Claire and Ross work together to make everything happen the grow closer and closer, (something that was also on George's list.) but her past keeps holding her back.

Kate who after many years of marriage and two children is told by her husband that he is leaving her for another woman.

While I normally avoid the paranormal genre, I do love a good ghost story. Emphasis on good. The story and the ghost. Im not into evil or creepy paranormal beings, thank you. I very much enjoyed both the story and the ghost in The Perfectly Proper Paranormal Museum. It always helps when there is a compelling historic mystery surrounding the ghost, in addition to the present-day mystery plaguing our main characters. But not to worry  if you aren't into ghosts at all, this book is definitely more cozy mystery than paranormal suspense.

Along with the mystery  full of suspects that kept me guessing (my prime one was killed off early on so much for my amateur sleuthing abilities lol)  a very light hint of romance threads through the plot. And when I say hint, I do mean that. The hint solidifies into something more viable toward the end, but remains just out of reach & sets the stage nicely for further development potential in future books.

Im not sure yet if there are one or two possible romantic interests for Maddie.  The clear frontrunner is hunky Mason. But theres definitely some sort of electric connection between Maddie and Slate.  I just cant tell if its romantic or something else.  Perhaps some paranormally-type connection yet to be revealed.

Bottom Line: The Perfectly Proper Paranormal Museum is unique, well-written, and fun! The quirky museum, the array of likable characters, a curiously intuitive cat, and a ghost who may have been wrongly accused  these elements all give a creative twist to the usual cozy mystery formula.  With enough romantic potential to satisfy people like me, it also is the perfect choice for people who prefer more mystery than kisses.

I hadn't heard of many of these men before (please don't judge me) so I got to know some interesting figures from history that I wouldn't have learned about otherwise.  I also liked how the author focused on the good influence these men had on the world and the way they stuck to their guns and didn't back down when faced with pressure.  This is a collection of impressive men that relied on God to see them through the challenges they faced and were able to accomplish amazing things because of it.

Since I knew little to nothing about most of these men before reading this book, I would have liked more information about them than what was included.  Most of these men had very eventful and interesting lives and it was difficult to get a sense of that with a 30 page mini-biography.  However, if there had been as much information as I'd wanted, the book would be a monstrosity.

He couldn't be the one to ruin the relationship she had with her father.  But he was miserable.....he missed her so much.....his brothers were worried about him.  Each one of them came by to see him with their words of wisdom to help him along.  But his feelings for Chloe keep getting in the way.  He figures he is just meant to be alone for the rest of his life.

I love his story.  The author has done such a good job with Chance...you feel everything right along with him and then you cry for him.

That said, I thought this tale to be filled with intrigue and adventure. And yes, romance too.

Both Elijah and Cate, are trying hard to not fall in love, but cupid has other plans for the two. As they begrudgingly start to work together to solve the mystery, as well as the death of his brother, they slowly start falling in love.

If you love your romance to feature plots of mystery and adventure, this one will definitely fit that bill.

868,"This novel explores the vulnerable imagination of thirteen-year-old girls still clinging to innocence but on the verge of the knowledge the world bestows, stripping away the fragile cocoon of childhood, where magic is still possible, but demons lurk in the darkness. Best friends and neighbors, Lizzie Hood and Evie Verver share everything until the summer before high school in their Midwestern suburban community when Evie disappears. Refusing to relinquish Evie to the terrors that the adults have already assumed, Lizzie clings to hope, drawn to Evie's family and the unfolding emotional drama of a handsome, loving father, a goddess-like older sister and a ghostly mother, even more insubstantial since Evie's disappearance. Lizzie desperately wants to help as she slides smoothly into Evie's environment, dredging up memories, searching for clues the police might have missed. A girl in crisis who cannot find traction in her own fatherless home, Lizzie is lost without Evie- and the family that has welcomed her throughout childhood.

While Abbott captures the intimacy of friendship and the often unreliable impulses of young girls' hearts, the beat of disquiet thrums, secrets bloom in the dark and emotions collide even before Evie's disappearance. The shining family, repository of Lizzie's happiest memories, shatters more the further she is drawn into an emotional vortex beyond her ken, both rapturous and vulnerable as her discoveries aid the search for Evie. This novel bridges the chasm between childhood and reality, Lizzie vaguely conscious of what she knows but cannot bear to acknowledge. This tough novel is filled with horrors, perhaps too slight to bear the weight of its terrible revelations, the truths that fill the shadowy places of the Verver's home. Vacillating between seduction and brutal frankness, Abbott holds a mirror up to society's faade, Sleeping Beauty staring into the eyes of evil, poison apple staining her lips.

Although there were a lot of characters to keep straight, I found the author's writing excellent and each character came alive for me. I really enjoyed the setting of Chattanooga and the historical facts she brought into the story. I found this made the story more interesting as I enjoyed the history.

Peter is running the bank and his integrity is a breath of fresh air. I love how he is always trying to do the right thing, even regarding his partner's daughter, Mary Beth. When his partner is dying, he asks Peter to watch out for Mary Beth and this adds more complication to his already complicated life.

I really enjoyed this book and it was a very pleasant read. I liked the intrigue, romance and history. I learned some things as well as being entertained. If you enjoy historical fiction romance, you'll truly enjoy this book! I give this book 4.5 out of 5 stars.

Patience arrives in Nevada City, Montana Territory in the spring of 1866 to take over her inheritance,  her grandmother's boarding house.

When farmer Jamie becomes depressed after being left alone with his farm and its animals to care for, his friends decide he needs a good woman.

When schoolteacher Lydia gets out for the summer, her friend gives her something to look forward to besides remaining at the beck and call of her widowed, ailing mother.

This is not a romance, even though it sounds like the beginnings of one. It's a reminder of how inhumane caretakers of children can warp lives. It's also a portrait of how hope is an integral part of the human character. It's also a story of how strange life can sometimes be.

5652,"Dramatic and fated, this conclusion to Crown of Lies is one dark romance that grabs you and never lets go till the last heart-pounding page.

I was painfully impatient and needy to read this because I craved to uncover all the secrets, and to see Penn redeem himself from all his lies and his ill treatment of Elle. And, believe me, he does. So does she!

This strong woman realizes many things, too, and fights her own guilt. Yet this novel jumps from one terrifying obstacle to the happiness to another with scary celerity. I cringed at the severity of Elle's ordeal at the beginning of this second and last novel. She suffers so much, yet is always strong, resilient. The wods describe both her helplessness and her bravery so vividly.

SPOILER

The only thing that was confusing for me is what happens after she is saved from her ordeal. She goes to Penn's home without waiting for the police to give a statement and have evidence gathered of her bruises and mistreatment.

END OF SPOILER

Anyway, all the past injustices and hurts coalesce into the present, drowning Penn and Elle in another wave of despair that prevents them from being together, of healing their wounds and start anew. That part was incredibly intense and harrowing. They hate and love each other with ferocity, and it was amazing to read!

The characters fight to the bone for their freedom to enjoy love at last. It's a tale of atonement, of restitution, of lust and need and forgiveness and wrongs so raw that they become yours. I admit that Penn was stubborn as hell and he dragged the impossible nature of them being together too far. I'd have cut out his last stand and make-up scene, but it all paid off in the end. Impressive dark romance.

1581,"Of course it's very hampering being a detective, when you don't know anything about detecting,  and when nobody knows that you're doing detection, and you can't have people up to  cross-examine them, and you have neither the energy nor the means to make proper inquiries; and,  in short, when you're doing the whole thing in a thoroughly amateur, haphazard way.  -A.A. Milne (The Red House Mystery)
A.A. Milne is, of course, best remembered for his series of Winnie the Pooh tales.  In addition, he wrote for the famous British humor magazine Punch, was a fine playwright and, though he served in WWI, became an outspoken pacifist.  In the midst of all this, he wrote one of the classic English drawing room mysteries--The Red House Mystery.  The book ends on a note which seems to imply that further adventures will follow, but sadly none did.
The Red House is a British manor, home to Mark Ablett, and gathering place for his fun loving friends.  But the bucolic setting is disrupted when Ablett's long lost brother, black sheep of the family, is murdered and Mark goes missing.  Two guests, Antony Gillingham, a sort of Holmsian jack of all trades, and Bill Beverley, a mildly dense Watson-like sidekick, take it upon themselves to solve the crime.  What follows is a reasonably dated but still amusing ""intuitive"" mystery.  Raymond Chandler apparently went out of his way to attack the story as one of the worst examples of the genre, wholly lacking in genuine criminological methodology and requiring enormous intuitive leaps on the part of the ""detectives"".  Still, take it for what it is and it offers a pleasant enough reading experience.

Author: J. Nathan
Five Stars
In For Finlay by J. Nathan we meet the watergirl of the University of Alabama football team.  Finlay Thatcher is in her Freshman year but she sat out for 2 years to deal with some personal issues and to try to find herself again.
Caden Brooks is the star quarterback, but, he wouldn't have been if things had been different.  Caden is a playboy and Finlay convinced herself 2 years ago that no matter what she would ALWAYS HATE Caden. Or would she?
Caden has been assigned by the coach to gain the friendship and respect of his offensive line.  To do this Caden has decided to throw a party at his house.  When Finlay arrived everyone was off in their own corners not mingling together.  Until Finlay got them all together to play drinking games and to bond.  This improved the morale of the team and made them work together.
Caden and Finlay found themselves thrown together a lot.  They kept getting closer and closer and Finlay couldn't help but to like Caden even though she made herself a promise to HATE him.
This book follows the couple through rough times and times of truth and trust.  Can Caden understand why Finlay kept the truth from him?  Can Finlay forgive Caden for being a Jerk and jumping to the wrong conclusions when Lindsay told him lies, and he believed Lindsay and wouldnt listen to Finlay.
This book touches all the feels.  I read it from cover to cover in one sitting as seems to be my prefered way of reading here lately.  Enjoy this college sports romance.  I sure did.

Shes one of those heroines who doesnt like asking for help when she needs it.  Shes enamored with Everett but still wary.  Shifters are known but nobody really trusts them yet and they are ok with that and keep to themselves.  Everett has this idea to be like his father.  Which isn't a bad thing but he happens to have 5 mates and has produced 19 cubs.  So, Everett wants 3 mates to reproduce and have cubs.  Maybe not as many as his father but close to it.  In a way this totally freaks Maisie out and she refuses to be Everetts mate because she doesnt want to share him.  Good for her!  She stands her ground!    It takes him quite awhile to understand where she is coming from.  Everett is different hes kind of a caveman/old world/chauvinistic type of guy.  Hes sweet and totally alpha and very protective but he doesnt seem to understand human females that well.  LOL.  At the risk of losing Maisie who he wants really badly he realizes he loves her and cant live without her.  If that means he only has her as a mate then hes ok with that.  Jay her ex is a creeper and a little bit crazy and comes after her a few times.  She has this best friend Lisa.  I liked her at first but she turned on her in a way and pretty much was a specist.

2002,"While historical romance may be the subgenre I gravitate toward within Christian romance, every now and then a contemporary romance will come along and impress me. Made to Last is full of great plot twists, wonderful characterization, and sweet and funny moments. While it may not be set in the past, the ""foreign"" and ""formal"" situations (the world of TV stars and big-name reporters) still swept me away to another place, and I enjoyed the excursion very much.

One big conflict propels the story along, but constant added conflicts or new twists on the effects of the big secret keep the story moving along at a nice pace. I loved the contrast between Miranda's mountain home (and other country situations) and the craziness of being behind the camera, featured on a widely read celebrity blog, etc. And Tagg did a marvelous job of crafting the story in terms of the seasons. (Something I had to focus on, of course!) The themes of letting go and dying dreams correspond with the leaves falling from the trees and the cold winter weather setting in. And yet there is hope as the hero and heroine learn how to face those seasons and find the precious truths hidden beneath the piles of leaves.

With an intriguing cast of characters and the right mix of the familiar/realistic and the exciting/imaginative, as well as a delightful dose of humor, Made to Last is a memorable romance story. Tagg's writing resonated with me, and I can't wait for her next book, Here to Stay!

2112,"Jane Lewis had thought of herself as Plain Jane for many years. During college she had been overweight and shy and had witnessed the rape of Connie Bryan, a beautiful classmate, engaged to be married immediately after graduation. Connie was terrified of her fiance's reaction to the brutal attack and made Jane swear not to involve the police or tell anyone. A short while later, Connie committed suicide and Jane has been haunted with guilt and felt she should have done something to help Connie.
Years later, Jane Lewis is a successful psychologist with a popular radio talk show, when an old college classmate, Michael Sorenson, introduces himself. Jane is now slender and beautiful but still thinks of herself as plain. She is immediately attracted to Mike, who is also a successful psychologist, and he encourages her to delve into the past to rid herself of the guilt she has suffered for so long as a result of Connie's death.
Trixie and Fred, Jane's godparents, the people she cares most about, are eccentric and endearing and funny. They are co-authors of a long-running, successful series of action thrillers. Trixie and Fred, as well as Jane, adore their dogs and treat them almost like human beings.
In her efforts to uncover the long-buried circumstances surrounding Connie's death, Jane becomes involved in some dangerous situations. Fortunately, with Trixie, Fred and Mike watching out for her she never strays too far into dangerous territory.

I figured the best way to dive into the m/m genre was to read one from an author whose books I love. There was a serious disconnect for me with this one though. The explosive chemistry and the spark between the characters that was so prevalent in the previous books, was missing from Cory and Judes story. I just didn't feel the connection between these two guys.

Cory is a tattoo artist at Raw Ink and Jude is the guy hes had his eye on for awhile. Jude spends his days at the skate park, keeps to himself and hardly utters a word. Cory has no idea if Jude would even be interest in him, or any other guy for that matter. After a series of run-ins between the two of them, Cory wants to get to know Jude even more. He has the perfect opportunity when Jude books a tattoo appointment with him.

The development of their relationship and the storyline was lacking a bit for me. Both Cory and Jude had heartbreaking pasts, but it didn't help to cement their connection for me. When Judes past finally caught up to him, it was wrapped up way too easily. It all felt a little underwhelming.

The story begins in 1984 when Solomon is 87 years old and is told in a series of flashbacks.  While ghosts do feature in the story, it's really more of a tale about the life and mysteries surrounding the family of our narrator, Solomon Wayfield, as a young boy growing up in rural America at the turn of the 20th century.

The plot and writing are decent, but the author meanders on a few occasions. The tenor of the story is rather subdued, so that the writing may appear slow at times.  I found the transitions between the past and present day to be a bit clunky.

She manages everything, including her brother, the Duke of Ravenwood's home. She can foresee pretty much any possibility and leaves nothing to chance. One would almost think she was prescient, but no, just highly organized with a gift for memorization utilizing word association.

Collins creates an entertaining narrative as he contrasts pairs of companies: A&P vs. Kroger, Abbott vs Upjohn, and more.  Why do some survive and become great while others quietl fade away?

Unlike many authors who share cozy anecdotes, Collins offers solid analytical distinctions.  The survivors faced reality, recognized their strengths, got rid of deadwood and provided quiet leadership.

My favorite chapter features the Stockdale paradox. During eight grueling years as a Vietnam POW, Admiral Jim Stockdale determined he would survive and would save as many fellow POWs as

possible. Regardless of anyone's position on war and military, Stockdale demonstrated rare courage and was credited with saving many lives.

When Collins asked, ""Who was least likely to survive?"" Stockdale said, ""That's easy - the optimists.""  Those who anticipated being home by Christmas were the most discouraged-- most likely to give up on living.

In a world of chirpy coaches urging us to ""Think positive,"" this view seems realistic and refreshing.

I also liked the story of Nucor, a small company that outpaced Bethlehem Steel. While Bethlehem built office tours to accommodate demands for corner offices, Nucor stayed lean and mean.

In between their meeting and their loving, there's a game of indoor croquet for those readers who can't get enough pall-mall in a Julia Quinn romance.  And speaking of Julia Quinn stories, this James romance isn't any better than what Quinn churns out.

I couldn't even find James's trademark clever, intelligent writing.  There's some terrible grammar in this novella written by an English professor.  How about this sentence, for example:  ""Oliver scooped her up and LAY her on the bed.""  I had expected James to know the difference between ""lay"" and ""laid"".

This is not really worth the read.  Although not very expensive, it's also not very well developed and not interesting.

722,"My initial reaction after reading this book is one of pronounced ambivalence. Although the author intends to examine the factors that might have shaped his life into success and his namesake's life into tragedy, he spends most of this very short volume telling their respective stories (in a very serviceable and easy-to-read manner) without providing much analysis. The majority of the book tells his own story (which is to be expected), and the alleged eerie similarities that exist between Wes Moore the author and Wes Moore the convicted felon just aren't there. Yes, they share the same name--something that probably isn't all that rare--but beyond that, the similarities are few. I don't begrudge Wes Moore the author his success, but his purpose in writing this book is somewhat nebulous. He has every right to be proud of his numerous accomplishments, but juxtaposing his own life--an undeniable success--with that of a convicted felon (imprisoned for life for a crime he might very well be innocent of) just seems a bit too cruel.",3,"[-2.3115170333745754, -1.4230657961792461, -1.0454657974156067, -1.0402172211834204, -1.169634794750421]",-1.0402172211834204

1205,"In 1925 one of the world's last explorers, Percy Fawcett, traveled into the heart of the  Amazon jungle with his son for his last expedition in search of a lost civilization.  It was a worldwide publicized event, with Fawcett writing journal entries and having a messenger take them to the nearest large town to be sent via telegraph to the rest of the world.  Then the entries suddenly stopped and Fawcett was never heard from again.  Expeditions were made to discover what happened to them; nothing was ever found, while some more people were lost to the Amazon.  The Lost City of Z  is the story of Percy Fawcett, his life and how he became a great explorer, and where his obsession for the Amazon came from.  It is also the story of the mystery of this doomed last expedition, and all the efforts - some ending in tragedy - that have been made since then.

David Grann is a staff writer for the New Yorker who first found out about Percy Fawcett while researching an article on the mysterious death of the world's foremost Sherlock Holmes expert.  The Lost City of Z takes Grann all over the world, from visiting Fawcett's great granddaughter and seeing some of his original journal entries, to putting together his own expedition to find out what really happened to Percy Fawcett.  The Lost City of Z is the incredible story of one of the last explorers, but it is also the story of the strength of the human spirit and it's drive to never give up.  Percy Fawcett was a real life Indiana Jones and this is his fascinating story.

477,"Anne Frank went into hiding , in 1942, with her parents and sister and four other people , in the sealed off back rooms of an Amsterdam office buliding , when the Nazi invaders of the Netherlands , intensified their persecution of Jews.

They were all dicovered in 1944 , by the Nazis, and of the group , only Anne's father Otto Frank survived the war. Anne died in the hideous death camp at Belsen.

In this remarkably intimate and beautifully written classic , Anne documents the two years in hiding - how they survived , amusing observances about the different residents of the house , as well as her own remarkable development , such topics as her sexuality and the development of her relationship with Peter Van Daam , as well as her sparkling brilliant intellect.

She reveals the peculiarities and personalities of the people who live with her in the annexe , in a series of accounts and amusing anecdotes.

One could ask why the Nazis brought about the death of this good , intelligent and charming child. One should ask what moves man to commit such horrors. What moved the Nazis to kill over a million Jewish children. What moves people  to justify the murder of Jewish children in Israel today by Arab terrorists , or to justify the monstrous tyrannies in North Korea, Red China, Zimbabwe or Iran?

The book can equip young people to answer the questions that will be thrown at them today: Why did the Nazis do what they did? Why did the people of Europe allow it to happen? Why do we need the State of Israel?

We are living in time when values are distorted , moral relativity and the inversion of the truth are the order of the day. Anti-semitism is on the march again , in the shape of genocidal hatred of Israel. It is today that it becomes so relevant , Anne Frank's word in her diary: "" It's twice as hard for us young ones to hold our ground and maintain our opinions , at a time when all all ideals are being shattered and destoyed , when people are showing their worst side , and do not know whether to believe in truth and right and God'.",3,"[-2.5177160746924097, -1.3381713557693566, -1.0888260842566104, -1.0410834880380853, -1.0510804447532074]",-1.0410834880380853

1302,"I first became familiar with Sarah Vowell's work via her radio appearances on NPR's ""This American Life"". While she brings an unapologetically slightly left of center view to her work, she also brings the subjects she examines to vivid life in ways that are insightful, humorous and reflect strong academic discipline. While her overall approach may be not be appreciated by staid historiographers, for those looking to plug gaps in their knowledge of historical subjects: she is a great resource.

""Lafeyette in the Somewhat United States"" explores the role of the teenage general, Gilbert de Motier, Marquis de Lafayette in the American Revolution. Centered on Lafayette and his access to the military and financial might of France in assisting the US colonies, it expands in a series of other examinations, to include Lafayette's relationship with George Washington, the politics of colonial military command and the larger evolution of diplomatic relations between France and the colonies.

Vowell is very effective at providing context on what is really going on in the background of the rather staid documentary records of events from the late 18th century. She does this in ways that are often laugh out loud funny and useful for providing contexts on issues we face in the modern world.

I started placing dog ears on the funniest passages as I read...and then stopped, because she is witty at every turn, and she uses this wit to effectively illuminate what she writes about. About his arrival in Charleston, Vowell quotes Lafayette's letter: ""Everything around me was new...the room, the bed draped in delicate mosquito curtains, the black servants who to me quietly to ask my commands...the luxuriant vegetation..."". Then she provides this interpretation: ""In other words, it was a buggy swamp full of slaves."" While some might bristle at such irreverence, it has the undeniable quality of bringing life to the often stodgy presentation of traditional history.

I grew up in parts of New Jersey that the armies described in this book traversed while moving men and materials between New York and Philadelphia. No teacher or local historical society ever succeeded in bringing the history of the area to live as Sarah Vowell does here (although Annie Garvin came close!).

Willem retraces his steps to discover how he ended up in the hospital and sets out to find Lulu. Along the way he tells the story of his family and the great disconnect between his mother and himself, and learns more about himself then he thought he knew.

I don't read a lot of contemporary YA fiction. I have a couple of favorite authors that write contemporary YA fiction and I generally try to read/listen to their books. These include Maureen Johnson, John Green, Rainbow Rowell and Gayle Forman. I loved the If I Stay/Where She Went books and also Just One Day (the first half of this series). I'd heard mixed reviews about Just One Year, but I decided I needed to know how Willem and Lulu's journey would end.

After having finished the audiobook of Just One Year, I have to say this was the story that ""I"" wanted told. It might not be the story that everyone wanted to hear, but it was the one I wanted. I wanted to know why Willem had been travelling for so long, never stopping long, never spending any real time with anyone. In Just One Year we find out why he is this way and what it takes to make him keep his roots in Amsterdam. We find out the story of his past and his family, and how the disconnect between his mother and himself and his Uncle starts to narrow and they become more of a family. We delve into his acting and feel his passion for it. It is a beautiful story.

Gayle Forman writes a beautiful story, and I enjoyed every minute of it. Loving travel myself, I loved all of Willem's travels from India to Amsterdam to Cancun - it was a great a adventure! I loved all the colorful people he meets on the way and we meet his friends in Amsterdam and his family. It was a great story and even though I personally would've liked more Lulu, I still loved every second of it.

Daniel May narrates Just One Year and gives a great voice to the character of Willem. There is a diversity of accents in this book and he delivers them all superbly. I wouldn't hesitate recommending this series to YA fans. I do recommend starting with Just One Day though to get the full experience of these two books.",3,"[-3.305802198726627, -1.591074115658413, -1.0775141300613051, -1.0457037745803952, -1.1342038023567835]",-1.0457037745803952
3765,"The book description calls Patricia Forde's The List ""Fahrenheit 451 meets The Giver for middle grade readers!""  That seems pretty apt.  The List is cut from the same cloth as the recent trend of teen-oriented post-apocalyptic and dystopia fiction.  While this whole genre of YA novels would point to classics like Fahrenheit 451 and The Giver as sources of inspiration, none of them measure up, including The List.

Letta, Forde's young, female heroine (most of these have young, female heroines, of course) is the assistant to the Wordsmith of Ark.  Ark was founded by an environmentalist named Noa (haha) who became frustrated when no one heeded his warnings about the rising sea level.  He established Ark, the ice caps melted, and his new city was high and dry, seemingly the last remnant of human civilization.

Noa, the authoritarian leader of the tightly controlled community of Ark, believes that language was the root of all of humanity's problems.  ""Our aim is to curtail the use of language,"" he tells Letta, who becomes the Wordsmith after her mentor disappears.  ""As you know, throwing words around is quite irresponsible, considering our history.""  His public agenda is to limit language to The List, a list of a few hundred words.  His private agenda, which Letta eventually catches wind of, is much more insidious.

The List isn't bad.  It checks all the boxes for the genre.  Noa is a caricature of the evil dictator with a charming side.  The central planning and the enforcers of societal structure are stock as well.  The List is not wholly cookie-cutter, but it was not original or well-written enough for me to love it.

2846,"Those readers who have ever felt like their hard work has been slighted, not taken seriously or even ignored, will relate well with Patience, the acting headmistress of Rosemere. And having a novel start with the hero being followed is a sure way of creating suspense. Sarah Ladd's novel tugged at my emotions from the very first line and kept me turning pages until the very end.
While reading this novel, I felt I was in the school, enjoying the many antics, frustrations and exuberance of the young girls who had been placed in the school. The idea of sending young children to a resident school is very foreign to me, yet I relish the idea of the growing friendships that would result in this. The customs of the day, including the fact that a woman unmarried and over the age of 21 was considered a spinster seems unusually harsh in our day when a lot of women choose not to marry until they are older. Sarah, through her story, enlightened me while still entertaining, on what life in England in 1816 would have been like, and what I could have expected to encounter. The lessons that Patience learned, are still valid today.

I enjoyed this novel immensely, and trust you will as well

1216,"Michael Crummy's quirky ""Galore"", with  sparks of brilliant writing was, unfortunately for me a considerable let down.  Landscapes and human prospects are equally bleak in a town ironically know as Paradise Deep and one more aptly named neighbor,  Gut.  Inhabitants are invariably (and soon) tiresomely quirky.  Characters like Devine's Widow, the matriarchal wiccan contrasted to a drunken and sybaritic RC Father Phelan.  Protestants v. Catholics and children like Mary Tryphena grow to marry not their heart's love but the washed ashore detritus that reeks of dead fish. Good luck...

Indeed Mary Tryphena, Judah and Absalom are the exception, being somewhat fleshed out.  People sort of float in and out without much purpose except to move the years along.  Crummy never stays with anyone very long so Judah may or not be a lucky talisman; Jabez Trim and his wife ache for children and ultimately succeed but we hardly know of their joy.  Indeed, joy and even satisfaction are noticeably absent from the lives any of these Labradorians.  Everyone just sort of drifts from crankiness to misery to shortage to bad weather-- flotsam in nature's harsh and uncompromising universe.

I don't think it necessarily bad that the author depict something so dreary and unpleasant, but I would like to know why anyone in their right mind would want to stay in such a harsh and depressing place. Habit?  Lack of imagination? Masochism?  When Absalom is banished for falling in love with his first cousin I wanted to shout ""run, Abie run, and don't look back.""  Banishment seemed like the lotto jackpot.  Unfortunately we don't know what ties these folk to such a miserable and forbidding place.  And that is a pity.

There are actually two stories told here, some of it we know but Mair never has all the answers.

Minerva is the English neighbor and Gloria, the Amish homemaker, and the two have never gotten along.

What I loved, though, was their hope in the land.....hope that the vegetables they grew in their little family gardens would sustain the family through the winter.

208,"We first met Maisie Dobbs in the Spring of '29.  Now it's the Summer of '32 and Nazi sympathizers are starting to come out of the woodwork in Britain.  Maisie finds herself doing some top-secret undercover work  for Special Branch as a philosophy teacher at a college dedicated to pacifism.  There's a murder.  Maisie's  old friend Sandra from Ebury St. becomes a widow under circumstance that also suggest murder.  A smudged postmark suggests James has not been leveling with  Maisie about his whereabouts. The Beales are on the move. Frankie takes a back seat in this one--perhaps because he's too busy courting.  Stratton's clearly unhappy with his new job and new boss.  Plagiarism enters the picture  as a major plot point.  And a new character,  Margaret Rose, gets added to the cast. Never a dull moment, as usual...

And, as always, Jacqueline Winspear delivers another great read in this, the 8th  in her Maisie Dobbs series. Because it's so strong on character development and relationships, this is a series that really should be read in order.  Here's the list:  1. ""Maisie Dobbs,"" 2. ""Birds of a Feather,"" 3. ""Pardonable Lies,"" 4. ""Messenger of Truth,"" 5. ""An Incomplete Revenge,""  6. ""Among the Mad,""  7. The Mapping of Love and Death,""  8. ""A Lesson in Secrets,""  9. ""Elegy for Eddie. 10. ""Leaving Everything Most Loved"" (coming 3/13)",3,"[-2.684221715815587, -1.6279554237690963, -1.133781907008607, -1.0700367395171007, -1.1750449630246664]",-1.0700367395171007
