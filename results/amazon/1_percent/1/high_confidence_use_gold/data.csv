Right out of the box, the first thing I discovered was the defective glass lid. It didn't even come close to fitting the slow cooker, and was so far off that it rattled constantly while the cooker was in use.

The next problem occurred when my wife discovered a burning rubber odor, which failed to go away after multiple uses.

The third issue was the fact that the slow cooker was never capable of fully cooking the food placed in it. My wife cooked chicken breasts, but after the suggested time was reached, the chicken pieces were still raw in the middle.

I thought that KitchenAid was a manufacturer of premium products. If this slow cooker is any indication, they certainly have a problem on their hands.

The bottom line is that the KitchenAid slow cooker that I received, had three noticeable defects. This rendered it unusable and I returned it to Amazon for a refund.",0,"[1.6306356307557441, 2.584027770338032, -0.5011181410315138, -1.0500350868056554, -1.7102077179719317]",2.584027770338032

Certainly the most confusing movie I've seen, this film instantly landed a spot in the top 5 worst films I have fallen victim to.

How did it get made?  That's the real mystery.  There weren't better scripts out there?  I could write a better script if I simply sat on the keyboard.  (Believe it or not, after this turd, somebody actually gave this guy money to direct another movie -- although not based on his script.)

It's like they gave a 14-year-old kid millions of dollars to make a movie and a single afternoon to write a script.  The script has no ideas or insight about anything -- terrorism, war, the media, the political machine, Marxism, you name it.  The movie is impossible to take literally (everybody's looking for Boxer, yet he can just go to a sidewalk cafe?), yet has nothing coherent to say on any allegorical level.

There are too many characters and the connections between them are unclear.  That voiceover guy seems to never stop introducing the movie, which initially reassures you since you're constantly confused, but clarity never comes.

Plus it just goes on forever.  Supposedly Andrew O'Hehir called this film ""about the biggest, ugliest mess I've ever seen.""  Lou Lumenick of the New York Post wrote of it, ""If a more incoherent and self-indulgent movie has been released so far this century, I'm not aware of it.""",0,"[1.3534144146174143, 2.2714280021985944, 0.04800645651896329, -1.0939775549909696, -1.4317217739544623]",2.2714280021985944

Koontz knows how to keep a reader interested and turning the pages, but the book slows down and as the killer and his plot unfolded I found myself disappointed. The suspense collapses near the end and the book left me with a feeling of ambivalence when I finished reading the story.

It's worth reading, but Koontz has written better books.",2,"[0.6597607786037829, 1.6874829521035033, -0.200307306274649, -0.9993283322482952, -2.038450078373143]",1.6874829521035033

The next thing I noticed was the flimsiness of the metal connector rods. Yes they were easy to insert one into the other and they were just as easy to fall out. I placed the unit into a large garden container and when I went to pull it out the bottom connector remained well inside the soil. So I glued everything together. Now at least it won't fall apart.

The top is nice, the spiral that holds the gauge is nice looking-- the gauge will fall out if the unit is tilted so place it firmly in the ground. I have yet to see what the wind will do to the gauge.

This was a dark twisted page turner and I loved every single page!!!

Tess and Brax have been together for years and they take an anniversary trip to Mexico ... While in Mexico Tess decides to reveal that she needs more in the bedroom from Brax!

""I wanted a new label. One that said: girlfriend who will do anything to be tied, spanked, and f***ed all over rather than adored.""

Brax well he's not into more so Tess leaves well enough alone ...

Meanwhile also on vacation Tess is kidnapped by human traffickers and sold as a slave!!

Through out the book Tess suffers at the hands of the traffickers but through it all becomes one strong woman and I fell in love with her character !! Q while obviously a little dark, twisted, and a dark erotic appetite well I fell in love with him too!!

Updated to a Razr M and it was good for about 4 months, then a couple weeks ago I started getting errors saying the card had been removed when it hadn't. At first a phone power down would get it working again, but after a couple weeks the phone refused to recognize the card as being installed at all. A 16G card from another manufacturer is instantly recognized and mounts and unmounts flawlessly. Tried the card in a USB flashcard reader with my PC, first time the card was recognized but with no data available. Tried unplugging and reinserting the card reader and other than that first time, the card has been unrecognized. At this point have to assume the card is dead. I'll give it 2 stars because while it was working it was very quick. I loaded about 400 CDs worth of MP3s onto the thing through my phone in about an hour, which was impressive to say the least.

Update: I got a Rosewill card reader the other day, and I was amazed that it was able to read this card again, and all the old data was intact. I have copied and pasted to and from the card.

A loooong masterful tenseness that literally made me scream. There's some very nasty surprises in here for people who haven't read these characters and realize this IS what they live with, every day it seems.  Some past characters truly get their just desserts. Good to know the bad guys will get theirs, even if it is a long time coming. Secondly, there is a man road trip. With a naked Homeboy. I swear, that had me giggling long into the night!

Another reviewer commented on having the hyperlinks going to the book rather than a short blurb as was done in an earlier book. Very frustrating as when I read I'm not connected to the Internet.

There is marital discord in this book that may be unsettling to readers of previous books who haven't read them all in a week. *I* could tell them what the problem was; however, the couple in question figured it out for themselves. But it took a while, and only when . . . well, you'll have to see for yourself. Sheesh.

One thing I HATED -- in Kindle books -- those you get from Amazon -- there is a place to review the book before you close it and forget what the book was about. (That's why this isn't a better review!) In the copy I downloaded, there was no such page.  Bad, bad publisher.  Whoever. Put that back in following books.  Please. Because now I have to jump over to Goodreads and post this review.

I see I have Last Call to read before I get into the rest of Mr. Konrath's writings. I may read those before I read that, because I don't want the enjoyment to end.  I have thoroughly loved this series. This is one of the best.

Previously I'd used a regular memory foam pillow (not shredded) and it caused my ears to fall asleep, which is really weird and very painful.  This pillow supported my back and neck perfectly.  I even found that lying on my stomach worked out if I put my upper body on part of the pillow as well.  I woke up with no aches or pains like I do from regular pillows.  It's also really nice to just have one pillow instead of stacking up several flatter pillows.

As others have stated, it has a strong smell and is hard to get out of the zippered case.  It is also hard to get into a king sized pillow case.  The smell does go away eventually and I didn't find it terribly objectionable.

Others have also stated that it's only the outer case that's made of bamboo and the inside is just regular shredded foam.  I don't really care what it's made out of since it's a great pillow.

The demons ( raped by his father) he was struggling with took entirely too long to reveal and he was a little creepy with his infatuation to Denise. He was rejected, but he took it gracefully but his action resulted almost like a stalker thing. Denise said she is a virgin; however, after there rumble she jumped up with no problem???Maybe I just totally missed something but I thought this was suppose to be an interracial book but the more I read, the more it is not??Overall, I did read it to the end, but sadly, it was extremely disappointing and didn't make the cut!!!",0,"[0.36056232907577956, 1.5489796893697374, -0.08625645773181811, -1.0397327615902814, -2.213893814837396]",1.5489796893697374

Finally in this book we get to sort of a resolution to the problem set out in ""Hostage"".  The issue here is that problem is almost lost in the minutia as well as overall topic of Black Ops.  Its like Griffin got side tracked by his own novel.  He got so enthused about Charlie doing this and Charley doing that that he forgot about what he started to do four books ago.  Certainly Griffin has created some amusing characters and filled them out partially (but not  perfectly).  I get the impression he was trying to achieve the same sort of run on effect as Diana Gabaldon's Outlander where your fans are just waiting for your next edition to grab it.  Griffin just doesn't achieve that status.  His characters are a bit flat, and I'm not so in love with the novels that I can overlook  the fact that a lot of the book was totally transitory to the story arc and didn't really add anything.  I am also unwilling to overlook that the real action of the story happens in less than 10% of the book and maybe only 5%.  If you're reading this review, then you've probably already covered the other 5 books in the series, thus you either agree with me or you're willing to overlook these faults because you enjoy the minutia of the story.

What I liked about the book- Carrie, the heroine was the perfect balance, not a virgin but not a hoe, a lady in the streets but a freak behind closed doors and a professional in a business meeting. She wanted Gavin to work for it and he made moves to make things happen but it wasn't easy, at least for what she thought it wasn't. Now Gavin was what every typical hero is in an erotic romance novel- filthy rich, alpha male, sexy, gorgeous and mysterious! They are both mysterious but the book is so short, you get excited for the sex scene but that was about it. Cause when something comes up.. the end of the book is here and your left saying seriously?
What I didn't like- it was short, cliffhanger ending was bad and it was missing something.. I guess that was the point but now I have to get hooked and pay the $0.99 to find out what happens, but I will see about getting any more.

9291,"This film reminds me of Gaspar Noe's Irreversible, in that it's initially an assault on the senses, and you feel as if you've seen great filmmaking because of it.  When I revisisted Irreversible recently, I found out I'd been had.  Noe's film is just an assault on the senses with nothing in its core.  Aronofsky's film, while nowhere as overly graphic, sadistic or disgusting as Irreversible, has this same quality.

As many have said here, the main message here is a very simplistic one, DRUGS ARE BAD.  It's almost on the level of an after school special, and that's a shame, as Aronofsky has a very good visual and editing style, but after nearly 2 hours of it, it's overkill.  I felt totally numbed after seeing this film.  I sat in my car afterwards, and I couldn't move.  But aside from the pure visceral experience of the film (which feels like a drug, the drugs the movie is telling us not to use), there isn't much left there.  There's some depth in Ellen Burstyn's character (she gives a great performance), but I believe that has to do with the fact this is based on Hubert Selby Jr.'s book.  If there is any humanism in this film, it's derived from the novel, not Aronofsky, who is like a kid with his new toy.  The characters of Leto and Connelly are especially bad, especially Connelly.  She is supposed to be a junkie, but she looks way too beautiful to be one.  Overall, the film is worth watching at least once, but it's essentially a visceral assault on your senses and little else.

A funny sidenote...Before this film screened (I saw it in a theater), the theater was playing The Wallflowers's album Breach, which is one of my favorite albums of theirs.  After I recovered from this assault, I kept thinking about how wonderful and tuneful those songs were, and I pretty much forgot about Aronofsky's film (until I wrote this review).  I bought Breach, and it's one of my favorite albums.  Thanks, Darren...",2,"[0.27281945248650064, 1.414067525550231, -0.5921561312542711, -1.0527600943220992, -1.1190451701879822]",1.414067525550231

Close the lid and lift by the back foot and hinge where it's not hot.  Easy to move.  Very easy to remove the middle section and toss in soapy water to soak.

Bought the dual sandwich maker, too, for baking biscuits to use as the bread.  I haven't experimented in other sandwich recipes, except grilled cheese.  That turned out quite good.  I think I made a sandwich on the bottom and one on the top section.

3831,"Here's the perfect way to describe the forgetableness of this book. Last night I finished a book and went to bed, with the intention of reviewing it this morning. This morning, I took my Kindle to the gym and started this book while on the stationary bike. When I got home, I reviewed the book I finished last-night and then sat down to look at my Kindle Collections to pick out what to read next, completely forgetting that I had started and read 30% of this book already. It made that little of an impression. When I finally remembered having already started it, I sat down to finish it up.

Now, don't misunderstand me. I'm not necessarily saying it was a bad book. I'm sure we've all read those books that we don't love, but we don't hate either. They're like cotton candya shot of sweetness that you can only savour for a moment and then leaves very little memory of itself. Yep, that's what this book was like.

Seeing the emotionless Tristan become attached to someone was nice. The fact that Rachel wasn't a complete pushover was appreciable. Her ultra-protective brother was fun. There were plenty of 'aww' moments and the sex was pretty mild.

However, quite a lot of the plot was just skimmed over or just plain unbelievable. For example, I'm still unsure why Aidan called Tristan to guard Rachel in the first place, other than that he disliked her fianc. That seems a little extreme. As far as I can tell there was no actual risk to Rachel that Aidan would have been trying to protect her against.

There is also a lot of history between the older generation of characters that isn't explored. The science isn't well explained. And the romance is lightning fast. It isn't insta-love, but within a matter of a day or so Tristan and Rachel fall madly in love and are willing to essentially throw their established lives away to be together. It too seems a bit extreme.

For a quick, fluffy read, this is worth picking up. If you're looking for great literature....um, it probably won't fit the bill. It does actually end, though. Yes, that's right, no cliffhanger!",2,"[1.0171685943830433, 1.351597738863879, -0.3623680810760791, -1.0439441811772492, -1.6873468626921637]",1.351597738863879

I turned this on at 55% for my bedroom for comfort, and it immediately went to work. I slept comfortably and noticed when I was awake that once the humidity was down in my bedroom, it clicked off. As another storm passed and the humidity gathered, it went back on.

It has a quiet hum, but nothing noticeable in my opinion, and it did not interfere with my sleep, listening to music, or watching a movie.

I have tried every bread knife and slicing guide on the market. Most work fine. (The Mercer bread knife on Amazon  is the best.). It wasn't the knives or the guides, it was ME. I couldn't slice evenly no matter what I did. One end thick, the other thin, you know what I'm talking about right?

When this slicer arrived I had 3 loaves waiting. One was a no knead loaf with a very crunchy, crusty exterior, another a very soft Challah egg bread, and the third, ciabatta rolls.  I had to experiment, of course, to get the right thickness for me. I found that the 12 & 1/2  notch area on the dial made  about a 1/2"" slice and was just right.

The loaves were a bit too big for the pronged pusher at first, so I very carefully sliced off the first three pieces before using it to hold the breads in place. Yes, it's much better to follow the rules and cut the loaf in half to use with the pusher, but well, I was anxious to see how it worked. Talk about impressive! The loaves were sliced into PERFECTLY EVEN slices in a matter of seconds!  Yes, SECONDS!  I knew at that moment that I should not have hesitated getting this slicer.

I got over my thinking that I'll only use this for bread, and I  tried a yam that I had on hand. Wow, yam chips in an instant. I raided the vegetable bin and sliced cabbage, a russet potato, and an onion. I was a slicing fool. I wasn't looking forward to the clean up but it turned out to be less of a bother than I thought. The bread crumbs were blown away with my compressed air can, and all I did to clean the blade was unplug the machine and carefully wipe it with a damp sponge.

But this sequence, shot less than a year after the first one, is a disgrace. It is just stupid, bad tasted jokes all the way.

Like many others I was expecting another Hangover type movie but with older people. The reason I try not to watch trailers is because they either give too much away or misrepresent the movie. This one is the later. They played it up like a Hangover movie but watching it this turned out to be so much more. While there was the obvious drinking and sex aspect this one did have a grown up plot and the fact that these four actors were in it really brought the level up from juvenile to real movie. Nothing against the Hangover movies because I liked the first and third one and if I were to compare this to another movie it would be those but this one did have a more grown-up feel.

This story could have been written about the kingdom of Anyplace, with King Anybody and Lady Anyone, and it wouldn't have made one bit of difference. Next, the book is not nearly as clever nor as funny as the authors seem to think it is. And the bits where the authors step in and directly address the reader also felt like an unnecessary gimmick. Finally, I had a hard time getting into the book. I started and stopped so many times during the first third to half of the book that it took me forever to get to the more engaging last half.

Getting past the crankiness, this is a cute book with likeable heroes and heroines, a bit of magic, bad guys who get what they deserve (more or less), and a happily ever after ending.

I can hardly believe it myself, even as I'm typing it out. I skipped entire paragraphs of a David Weber Space Battle because it was boring? How can that be?

I liked the plot of this book. I even like the complicated mix of characters, politics, diplomacy, family, and military action that has become the Honor Harrington series. I don't mind one bit that Honor was not the focus of the entire or even the majority of the book because I have grown fond of the other characters of the Honorverse and actually like reading about them. And, I can't wait for the next book.

The female protagonist, Autumn, was an uptight, prudish librarian with a stick up her ass. While many authors are able to take such a character and make their antics comical or endearing, this author did neither.  The male lead was also unimpressive. He was an arrogant, sadistic, ass that got off on toying with Autumn under the guise of conducting research for his latest novel. Any attempt to portray him as a sexy, dominant alpha-male fell short by miles.

What you're left with is 2 characters that you don't like, a predictable plot and so-so sex scenes. The story failed to evoke any emotion, probably because there was absolutely no connection to the characters. The ending was lukewarm at best and didn't come nearly quick enough.

His character is really unlikeable, but the director never clearly tilts us in favor of either his mom or his fiance (who gets stuck between the two of them during a trip to California), and thus the film feels unfocussed and shambling.

871,"For me, Room was not an easy read. Not for the content so much, but more because of the voice and limited vocabulary of a five-year-old narrator. I cant say that I got used to it, but eventually I got to the point where I could tolerate Jacks narrative.

I went into Room blind  not having read the book description or knowing what the story is about  so it took me a while at the start to understand whats going on. I think it was better that I didn't know, because as the story unfolded and realization dawned, it had a greater impact on me.

The reasons why Im not giving Room a full five-star-rating, is because of the difficult narrative, for one, but also because some of the content  which I feel didn't advance the plot, or add to the story in any way  made me feel uncomfortable, and sometimes made my stomach churn (like Jack sucking on his mothers rotted tooth, and then searching his poo for it when he lost it). I don't really want to go into more specifics here, because I don't want to give any spoilers; but also because the issues I had with some of the things Jack does or constantly refers to, are things I personally don't approve of or would not allow for my own children, as Ma did for Jack (although I do understand their circumstances were much different).

Other than that, I think Room was an incredibly insightful read and gave me lots to think about. I felt the last half of the book shouldve included Mas voice as well to fully get her perspective on how shes dealing with their ordeal, but Im also glad that I got to see the outside world from Jacks point of view.

There is rape, death, ow drama, there is loss of friends. It was just entirely too much in this story.

There was also a bit of victim blaming. Damien indicated that she let herself get caught. This also was stupid to me.

Hercules as a story has been done many times before both as a movie and in television.  Unfortunately for this movie, it has been done much better before.  With poor casting, poor acting and overacting and herky jerky filming with its gratuitous use of slow motion (almost felt like I was in a Matrix movie.), this movie almost felt B-grade quality even though it had a 70 million dollar budget...  I mean like seriously 2 decades pass and Queen and King don't age a day? You couldn't actually add some makeup to make it believable that two decades passed??

Some of the fight sequences are ok but the way it is filmed (what the heck is that stuffed lion looking thing??)just annoyed me and gave me a headache instead of being truly enjoyable and the characters and actor choices just didn't work for me.

Honestly I thought the TV series of Hercules was better conceived than this.",1,"[0.8527595124542036, 1.1334197294673518, 0.08183502632698048, -1.0623186791057428, -1.8613922410910173]",1.1334197294673518

This book had everything I look for in a book. It was definitely a page turner. Keeping my hooked from beginning to the end. This book has everything I enjoy in a great read! It was full of angst, heartbreak, love romance, and my stomach was on a roller coaster of feelings and I loved it.

This book really centers around Chloe and Gavin. They are childhood best friends, that love each other. But because of different circumstances and people. They never really act on their feelings. Through out this book you will see these two fight what they feel and be afraid to show them,  These two story like any good book will leave you frustrated.  Watching them miss opportunities and watching the stubbornness that lead to miss moments was sometimes that drove me crazy. There were parts in this book that made me cry, made me laugh and made me swoon.  Like I said every emotion was it with this story!

After thinking about it, I realized that I just did not care about the main character,Landry James because she doesn't care about anything but self gratification and sex. She is basically an amoral, bored housewife who doesn't love her husband, only the things he gives her, and seems to spend her days caring only for her grooming and looking for new sex partners. Even when she and her friend are threatened at a sex club, she's excited by it, not worried that her friend had a knife to the throat. In the end, she is recruited to be a sort of Mata Hari. She'll get paid by the government to have sex with men and get pillow talk information from them because she'd be doing it anyway, so she might as well do it for her country (and money). Landry did not appear to have any motives other than selfishness or to have any deep mental processes. I think I'll pass on her further ""sex agent"" adventures, I just don't care what happens to her.

First it had to do with the characters. These two had zero chemistry. They were so boring and blah together. It seemed like such a fake romance with such a fake story. I just did not like nor could I believe they could be a couple at all.

Secondly, the story. I liked the idea of the single mother saving the life of the star hockey player and falling in love but the story fell apart before it even begun. There was way too much thrown in to really stereotype the female lead. Anything awful seemed to to happen to her yet she was the strong single mom. As far as the romance these two hardly ever talked to each other but fell in love? I just couldn't get into it.

On ""Paris"" (11 tracks, 40 min.), Paris Hilton tries to portray herself as the new Britney Spears musically speaking. And why not? With Spears herself pretty muc having disappeared, maybe there is room in the market. Unfortunately, Hilton's singing is so weak and flat that no amount of producing can fix that. It took some wincing to actually listen to this album from start to finish. If I can point out any highlights, I guess it'd be the reggea-flavored ""Stars Are Blind"" and the dance-along ""Nothing In This World"", and surely it's not a coincidence that both those tracks were released as singles. The album closer with an absolute horrible cover of Rod Stewart's classic ""Do Ya Think I'm Sexy"".

I love Amazon's website and the idea of the cloud music storage system. Every time I use a horrible storefront website like Dell or bad software like itunes I appreciate Amazon more. However, I bet in a year from now Amazon is going to have a mess with this ""free"" year of 20GB turning into a $20/year bill.

On Lady Gaga and Born this Way: I really like the song ""You and I"".  This is not Madonna like. There is a Queen hook in there but it's not Queen like either.  I understand the comparisons to Madonna but I believe that Lady Gaga is a better musician. I love to hear Lady Gaga sit and play piano and sing. There is a lot of talent beyond her being a student of pop culture.

I do not think this idea of Lady Gaga encouraging acceptance of one's genuine self is a little thing.  I think there are obviously lots of young people who long to be accepted as they work to be different. It's a paradox. Ultimately Lady Gaga is a genius.

Against their better judgment, Anne and Marco leave their infant daughter asleep next door while they attend a party at their neighbors. When they arrive home later that night, their baby is gone. What follows is a convoluted story about one familys secrets, lies and betrayals, with plenty of twists and turns to keep readers guessing.

The writing is rudimentary and theres basically no character development, allowing the story to move along quickly without requiring much of an investment from the reader. This is the kind of book I like to read on a Saturday night when I just feel like getting lost in a fun story for a few hours. Theres nothing truly outstanding or memorable about it, but it serves its purpose.

Im not really sure if all the twists and turns add up, and frankly, I don't really care. There were a couple of plot developments at the end that were notably unbelievable though, bringing my rating down from a 3.5 to a 3.

But then the story changes, becomes repetitious and the science was very farfetched. Now, I'm not saying farfetched is all bad. There are some very farfetched stories out there that have held my interest and that I've enjoyed. But in this case, the characters weren't very well developed and felt flat. The story felt like it was on a loop, giving us the same info, over and over.

And the ending was very abrupt. It felt like author Riddle decided he was going to write a set amount of pages and the book would end there, no matter what. 300 pages maybe?

Overall the book is ok. My main thing is there's lots of military explanations that I found boring, so I skipped through a lot; the second is the lack of character building. It's written almost as if an AI is giving a report of what occurs, not affecting anything about the characters into the mix. Very disappointing. The author definitely has a talent for writing but hopefully he'll learn to balance the immense tech download of information with what we really need to know in order to carry the storyline. And point blank he needs to incorporate more character building. It's the characters that carry and bring to life the story. Also, this story ended weirdly and in a weird spot.

Wow! I really liked this book! I was apprehensive about reading it due to the synopsis but I am glad that I did.

I had to really stop and a take a look at myself and say really, really you are going to like him? But in the end I decided YEP I liked him! Will you?
The title of this book is so fitting this book is RAW and filled with emotion and has those what the hell moments in it along with the NOOOO moments as well.

268,"We all know what the term ""graphic novel"" means, right?  Well what do you call a comic book that's written in the form of a novel?  Especially if it contains a few too many subplots that bring it perilously close to putting it in the romance genre?

Ms. Wecker has the germ of a good fantasy novel; as a result, parts of ""The Golem and the Jinni"" are OK.  There's also a bit of OK historical fiction thrown in about the lower East Side of Manhattan in the late 19th/early 20th century.  However, the book is too much like a cartoon combined with a romance novel and seems padded to boot.  The characters, dialogue and plot are wooden and lifeless, and I finished it more out of a sense of duty and from any driving compulsion to find out what happened.  It's an easy enough read, so I'll give it three stars rather than the two that it probably deserves; on the other hand, when I finished it on a flight yesterday, I left it in the seat back in front of me rather than make the effort to carry this (heavy) book around with me any more.",2,"[-1.5118667643700354, 0.9614866257971979, -0.16593092974628132, -1.0442125704004617, -1.5851447979872]",0.9614866257971979

7717,"Coconut water is everywhere but I will start by naming the disgusting-tasting brands first: Happiness Inside, Jax Coco, Coco Samba, Vita Coco, Zico Coconut. Not only are these brands expensive, they taste hardly anything like coconut water. Even if they claim they just have coconut water, the fresh rehydrating and natural taste of coconut water is lost in some process or another and you are getting a really bad sugar-water !

In Canada, you can get Island King Coconut Water which is DIVINE!!! But you can't find it here so I might as well just get over it. In the US, I started testing every brand I could get my hands on. Harvest Bay Coconut Water came up as #1 most delicious tasting natural no-other-ingredients and LOW SUGAR coconut water. The low sugar is likely the indication that it is a YOUNG coconut and not an old one as they tend to sweeten with age. And the young coconut water is BEST for you.

I ordered the 12-pack from Amazon and while not cheap, it comes out better than the WholeFoods price and it is OH SO delicious and makes you want more and more!

How I drink it: Because of the high amount of potassium, you want to be careful how much coconut water you consume. I dilute it at a 4-1 (water-coconutwater) ratio so that I drink more water and my water tastes yummy. Sometimes though I just take a swig or two of just coconut water! :)

I am also very pleased with C2O Coconut water which I discovered to my delight at my local Harris Teeter and they are also low-sugar and very delicious. So in a pinch, both do!

HIGH Marks and a true 5-star for Harvest Bay Coconut Water!!!",4,"[0.4128722623740606, 0.9516865466561311, -1.057120104134059, -1.037234871132933, -0.9042129241055421]",0.9516865466561311

Ive enjoyed other novels by Kirkpatrick I love her earthy style of writing. Theres something so genuine about it. I can say that the same style exists in the pages of this one. But there was something about these characters, that after spending a third of this book with them, I just wasn't all that interested what happened to them. I wasn't relating to them at all. There also wasn't a lot of a plot happening. Perhaps if one of those two things were different, I would have finished the book. As it was, I eventually just sat it down, and never picked it back up again.

Perhaps this was one of those books that just wasn't for me. Or maybe it just wasn't what I was in the mood for. But either way, I just found it to be a bit slow and not what I was hoping for.

I was hoping this book would delve deeper into the characters but that didn't happen; it didn't even do a little bit of character enrichment for the new ones. There's also the issue of things occurring that we know shouldn't happen. I hate that when writers don't write the scenes the way they naturally would be but force them a certain way because they need it to be that way. This makes me mad. As readers we read these scenes and go, ""really??!! Are you kidding me?!!"" Idk... The story just seemed like it didn't progress very far, it was just kind of flat. Don't get me wrong their are some thrilling battle scenes but ""battle scenes does not a story make"". The last thing is just a thought but I don't get the title at all. I think it's referencing the prince but I'm not sure. I'm moving on to book 3 but only because it's on kindle unlimited; I don't think I would otherwise.

Kidd has once again exhibited her exceptional talent and extraordinary imagination by delivering yet another captivating paranormal romance. She never fails to entertain her readers. Every time I read one of her books, I always finish feeling completely satisfied with a large dose of the warm fuzzies in my heart. The story is exciting, original,  imaginative, fast paced, heartwarming, humorous,  romantic, arousing and sensual. The dialog is smart, well written and flows beautifully. The characters are fascinating, captivating, engaging, endearing and sexy. Beautiful curvy Erin Numm is only 28 but she's done with dating and relationships. Heck, it's been 18 months since her last date. Yep, she's done with men! Or so she thought! While shopping with her sister, Erin is approached by a mysterious stranger who introduces herself as Olivia Grey with Lovely and Kind Brides, a  mail order mates agency for shifters. Huh? And most surprising, she has the perfect match for Erin! What? Sexy lion shifter and rancher, Owen Brooks is a man on a mission. Well, two missions to be precise. Number one is finding a mate through Lovely and Kind Brides. It's been 8 long months and still no success. Nope, so far nothing - until Olivia Grey submitted Erin's photo and profile. He took one look at the lovely Erin and he knew she was the one. Now all he has to do is meet her,  convince her to move to Sunset Falls and become his mate. Now for number 2 - get Sunset Falls back in American Shifter Weekly magazine as one of the best small towns in the country for shifters, an award they won once in 1953. And all he has to do is convince his family and the townspeople to help and whip Sunset Falls and his pride back into shape. Easy peasey! Right? Not! Sexy shifters-check! Beautifully curvy bride-check! Humor, romance and a little good old fashion sex-check! This is not a serial. It is a complete book with no cliffhangers.

I'd had a jar of this tahini sitting in the pantry for almost a year without using it! (Shhhhhh!)
I finally decided to just dive in and try it.

The jar had separated into oil and ""paste"", so it took quite a bit of stirring to get it creamy again. But even after sitting so long, ignored, it tasyed really good.

We made baba ghanoush with this. We didn't entirely like the flavor, so we added a can of garbanzo beans to the recipe (which was mostly tahini, eggplant and lemon juice), blended until smooth, and it was very tasty!
The kiddos inhaled it with tortilla chips.

1622,"I bought Want to Go Private many, many months ago based on some of the great reviews I read. Then of course it languished on my shelf for quite awhile until I had sudden urge to read it. It's not a perfect book, but its very captivating. I had a horrible time putting it down after I started.

 I'm sure you have some sort of idea about what the story is about, right? It's about a 14 year old girl who is facing normal 14 year old girl problems. The difference that instead of finding solace in her friends she turns to the 27 year old guy she met online.

My first reaction to Abby was annoyance. She is so, so naive. I would have never done or fell for the things she did at 14. But girls do! These things actually happen so it's not so hard to believe that Abby would make the choices she did. While she might not have been a 100% likable character she was realistic and that's all that matters.

Want to Go Private doesn't pull any punches. I was really surprised by how graphic the scenes are. It's not gratuitous or anything. Just shocking. It brings a horrifying and creepy nature to the story. If I was a young teen reading this I would be terrified to talk to strangers in chat rooms afterward. That's probably the point.

My favorite element of Want to Go Private was the process of finding Abby after she disappears. There's great detail about the police investigation. It was really fascinating. There were also just a couple of things that I didn't like. At times the writing was very repetitive. Math and Science were Abby's best subjects and that fact is pointed out countless times along with other sentences that seemed to be repeated almost word for word. I also felt a bit of disconnect from Abby after she was found. She never had this big Ahhhaa moment that I was expecting. Those things weren't that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things, though.

Overall, I enjoyed Want to Go Private as much as you can enjoy a book about internet predators. It was very captivating and impossible to put down.",3,"[0.896802215702124, 0.9166984757691292, -0.38467578934161384, -1.032961226035076, -2.1538787044994745]",0.9166984757691292

2295,"""My Utmost for His Highest"", a book of devotional readings for each day of the year, is a perennial Christian classic with three recurring themes encompassing a triune God:  Abandoning all to God, our Father and Creator; looking always to Jesus, our Saviour and brother, and becoming broken bread and poured out wine to nourish others through the work of the Holy Spirit.

  Although accessible to all readers and not overly academic, the daily scripture verses are cross-referenced with other embedded verses and important Christian concepts, revealing the comprehensive depth of Chambers' biblical knowledge.

  Throughout this collection, Chambers addresses one of the most  challenging perplexities of a Christian journey:  What will be God's part, given as grace, and what will be our part, as earnest striving, in living out our faith.  The July 7th entry in particular addresses this balance.

  There is material for fruitful meditation and discursive prayer on each page; one of my favorite pages is the entry for May 19th, ""Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?""

  A favorite quote from the book for me would be the conclusion of March 18th:""Be serious with God and leave the rest gaily alone.  Put God first literally.""  In my life as a Lay Carmelite I have found that advice works well: There is freedom and joy in taking all of life lightly, except for the one thing necessary-- an ever increasing love for God that fuels a deep desire to be constantly in His presence.",4,"[-5.002238553877156, -3.59710024795448, -2.3757381118707555, -1.0636498961861667, 0.9080026081364041]",0.9080026081364041

9679,"I ordered the Scotts Turf Builder Grass Seed - Dense Shade for an area of our yard which has had a problem with the former grass becoming thinner and thinner due to the growth of our trees. I wanted to give this product a try. The area I seeded which was about 25 square feet was also beat up by the snow plow from last winter.
I tilled the area down about 1-2 inches, raked it down and then rolled it. I applied the seed and then raked it in so that some seed was under the soil slightly and some was still on the surface. I watered it twice a day for about 2 weeks. We had four rains during that time also. It was indicated on the package that it would sprout within 6 -14 days. Nothing, it never sprouted. I checked the seed closely and found no indication of roots or germination.
I have another concern with this seed. It is treated with Mefenoxam which is a fungicide. The warning on the package states that; ""Do not apply near water, storm drains or drainage ditches. Do not apply if heavy rains are expected"". It goes on to warn against leaving it in the road or sidewalk, near food or children.

It is not a horror movie. It is a drama based in a near-future world, 2022, and it is certainly not predictable. Well, some things were, but not to the extent that the haters make it sound. This film takes us inside the home of one family during a 12 hour period of terror.

Weird and unusual, the plot is non-traditional and the tension keeps you on the edge of your chair for much of the movie. Acting and stunts were delivered flawlessly. Ethan Hawke doesn't perform in crap movies.

Let me just start by saying I am not giving this book 4 out of 5 stars because it was a bad book. The 4 out of 5 star is based purely on my preference as a reader, and this book was highly emotional. I suck with highly emotional books, because I am already emotional enough on my own lol.

With that being said, this book is Adriana Locke's best written book yet. You can really tell this story flowed from her heart. It is written very smoothly, and you will hang onto every word/sentence/and moment in the the book. She wrote all the characters very well. They are all completely developed and show their personalities well. Everliegh, is written so beautifully; she might be my favorite. Sometimes people don't write kids well, and Everliegh is written extremely well.

I loved some of the random added comments/moments in the book that you didn't expect. I don't want to say much else and spoil anything.

Once the main event of the book happens the story barrels along to its conclusion, but overall the text is overwritten and massively redundant.

As far as the story itself, it was quite honestly a snooze fest.  It could have been told in about half the time had the rather thin mystery aspect not been couched in seemingly endless accounts of cutesy family interactions, preachy homeschooling promotion, boring outings, and odd encounters with other town members who are all, apparently, rude, adversarial jerks.  Also, the inclusion of the term 'sex goddess' and the saccharine interaction between the protagonist and her husband was unnecessary and off-putting.

1384,"Wow. That this has a retail price of $18 is UNCONSCIONABLE. Even at Amazon's discount of about $10, it is a rip-off.  Ms. Harris says in the introduction that many fans were clamoring to know what happened to many characters not mentioned in the last book, and what happens in the future for those characters that did get mentioned. This book is supposed to serve as an epilogue of sorts to the series with that information. I expected a short book since this isn't a full story. However, this does not even qualify as a book.

This small book is just about 7 inches tall by 5 inches wide.  And each page has one character (or couple) and their ""epilogue,"" or a full page illustration which includes a stylized letter of the alphabet at each section to sort the characters by name. Only the epilogues amount to just a couple of sentences centered on a mostly blank page. In fact, John Quinn on page 138 actually says ""JOHN QUINN had many more adventures."" That's it! AN ENTIRE PAGE FOR ONE SINGLE SENTENCE!!

I am extremely disappointed that Charlaine Harris put her name on this.  If she wanted to give a little peek into the future for fans, this should have been an e-book for 99 cents - or better yet, free on her website. Instead, she let her publisher gouge fans for even more money for something that takes 10 minutes at most to read and probably took about that long to write.

As others have noted, the writing felt flat, and the performances forced. I think the real culprit was just a complete lack of chemistry between Reese Witherspoon and both her co-stars. I felt slightly more of a spark between her and Owen Wilson, or at least some mutual affection, but considering the fact that Paul Rudd's character is supposed to be challenging that in a love triangle, the complete lack of chemistry between he and Reese just really sunk the film. I think Owen turned in the best performance of the film, and was genuinely charming, but he couldn't save the film. Both Reese and Rudd just felt so forced, and like they were overacting. Jack Nicholson just didn't seem completely all there.

To say I loved this book would be an understatement. I have been in a book funk for weeks but this book helped me over that. I could not put it down. I finally handed my Kindle over to my husband at 1 am and told him to take it from me so I could get some sleep but it was the first thing I went for when I woke up. I had to see what Harrison and Hanna were up to!

Hanna is the little sister of Harrisons best friendso yeah, off limits. Whats Harrison supposed to do when he finds her constantly in his thoughts? Avoid, avoid, avoid thats what! But as luck would have it, hes stuck working with her for the time being. Can he keep his hands off her or will she tempt him over the edge? You have to read this book to find out!

I love forbidden romances. Throw in a cocky, sexy man and Im hooked but it was more than Harrison that made me love this book. I loved all the characters. I loved how Hanna was a sweet little temptress. She knew what she wanted and went after it. Boy did she go after it. Then theres Ethan (Hannas brother, Harrisons best friend) and his wife Michelle. Michelle was feisty and just awesome. Even though I loved Ethan, I wanted to punch him but I get why he did what he did but dude, listen to your wife! I love that there was more to Harrison than meets the eye and when Hanna discovered secret parts to him, she wanted him even more. Who wouldnt!

Sadly this was the first book Ive read from this author but it won't be the last. Ive been one clicking her other books. I love her writing style, its fun and fast paced. Its been a nice change from what Ive been reading. I love getting dual POVs. Being in Harrisons head was great. I just want to wrap my arms around him and Hanna was just lovable and adorable.

3086,"This is my third book by this author, the others being ""Hell Bent"" & ""The Chosen"".  I think she writes a good story but somehow so far hasn't totally satisfied me but I'm still persevering.  I admit to buying her books due to the low price but also based on the reviews.  ""The Heat"" had very, very many 5 star reviews and a few very bad reviews. I ended up somewhere in the middle.

I liked the strong characters, the alpha werewolves being their stereotypical arrogant, brutal selves like most of the genre. There were a few new twists and turns to their mythology which was well done.  As in the other HKW books I've read, the action scenes are very suspensefully written and the sex steamy.

Along with other reviewers, I wonder why there are so many typos, misplaced words and grammatical problems with Kindle books generally?  Why can't they be edited properly?  Is this the author's fault?  The errors can distract you from the story quite easily.

While there are other paranormal romances I've enjoyed more than this one, I will go on to read the rest of the series.  It's not as bad as some of the reviewers say and there is certainly something that still attracts me to this author.

The acting is horrible and the direction even worse and towards the end if you compare with better Science Fiction films it looks very pretentious. The last half hour was quite bad because of how the story dives down and the submission to the aliens. The characters that were built up for destruction like a Cabin in the woods really had no purpose of attention in the first place. Some say this was a prequel to some other film and some say there is a sequel coming, the acting and directing was quite horrible I felt. Michael Fassbender who is usually a terrific actor was quite mediocre in this, there was no sync in his character from beginning to end even though...*insert spoiler* The director didn't seem to know whether to make a Jurassic Park out of this film, or whether to make a Planet of the Apes or whether to just make this film ""The Core"" and trying to do so many things at once proved a little unbecoming for the viewer. I could have used more films as pawns. I wish the story line was built up better and there was more answers than the viewers being left to believe what is best.

This is a wholesome/sweet Christmas story that I just couldn't get into.  There are couple of things that kept taking me out of the story... The age difference between Maybelle and Vincent and between the secondary couple.  Women are much younger than the men.  The strictness of Maybelle's parents was confusing; they forbade her to do things while continuing to tell her she is an adult.  And the relationship between Vincent and his arch enemy.

The story is told in dual POV with flashbacks and the simplicity of the story would have been perfect if it wasn't spread over so many pages.

1447,"As I will sometimes do, I read the most helpful negative review and its comments after I finished reading the book.  I agree that this book has some frustrating problems and that Harris seems to have lost interest in the series, producing a quality series and/or is too influenced by Ball and the HBO series.  However, overall I still liked this book for it's mindless entertainment value.  In any case, I find it difficult to decided upon a rating. Part of me wants to give it 4 stars and another part of me, esp. after reading the most helpful negative review and its comments that do a good job pointing out what's lacking, wants to give the book only 3 stars.  The part of me that simply loves the series and the characters regardless of the author's obvious writing ineptitude and apparent growing indifference to the series wants to give this book 4 stars. I feel as indecisive has Sookie is in this book. LOL  I agree that this book needed to be longer and more detailed. I too felt that the loss of my favorite farie and Were seemed pointless and a waste. I hated the lost of these two favorite characters and the way in which the female was kill seemed lack luster, wasn't detailed enough and just didn't due her character justice.  The description of there Were's demise wasn't much better. So 3 stars it is!

Since I have previously read books 1 thru 11, I sort of know what coming and based on the reviews of books 12 & 13, I already know that the series ending will be a disappointment for the majority of the Series' fans myself included. If you're a diehard Sookie Stackhouse Series fan and have an obsession about finishing what you start read the book.  If not, quite while you ahead and stop at the last book.

3929,"I received a copy of this book in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.

I have to admit this is not my usual go-to genre. I happened to see the book on a site, and in reading the book description, I just had to get my hands on it and see if it really was as good as it had sounded.

The book is amazing! The world that was created is so realistic and well-done; its hard to believe that its not actually our own here and now. The characters are strong, well-thought out and fully defined. Everything was so beautifully written. Once you pick up the book, you will find it hard to put down. You are almost compelled, as it were, to see how the plot will play out. I read the book in one sitting, in approximately an hour and a half.

The only downfall, for me, was at the very beginning of the book. There was some bouncing around with going back into time and the main characters memories in order to bring us up to speed a bit on how she got to where she is now. It was a titter muddled and chaotic for me. It might just be me and the way my brain works, but I just didn't like it. It didn't feel right; it felt off to me. It was uncomfortable to read and I had to stop at various times to shift my thinking in order to get a better understanding of what had transpired. I think there is a much better and smoother way of the author accomplishing the same goal and getting their point across where there is not so much confusion on the readers behalf, not to mention that it would make for a way smoother introduction to the story. Once I got passed this though, it was smooth sailing, and I was pulled into the storyline until I had read the book to its completion.

With a perfect mixing of mythology, vampires, werewolves, half-breeds and humans to name just a few of the goodies you will encounter, together with various abilities, you have a paranormal, action adventure that rocks your socks.

It is exactly what it says it is, a story of a girl who sexually services the members of a motorcycle club, and she makes no apologies for doing so. I liked both her, her story, and all of the characters in her life.

I can't understand someone reading the descriptive blurb of this and then get upset when it contains somewhat explicit sexual scenes and vulgar language. Exactly what were you expecting when you read the words Motorcycle Club, flowers, candy and poetry? Enough of my little rant now on that!

Going back to the book review here, like I said, I found it a very enjoyable read. What put it in just the 4-star standing for me was the repeated statement throughout the book that the Brothers of Blood MC always stood together and would give their lives to protect each other and their families, it was really over used; we got it the first time.",3,"[-0.8941552202290537, 0.7678233337692046, -0.1882796970556555, -1.0287907393161637, -1.9981683572350353]",0.7678233337692046

9277,"I just watched this movie on DVD - I was skeptical. I couldn't imagine how the movie could possibly carry off a 13-year-old girl changing into a 30-year-old woman. It was very well carried out indeed.

The main character is a self-conscious 13-year-old who is on the fringes of the popular crowd. She yearns to be popular. At her birthday party she is humiliated by the very girls she wants to be friends with. Having seen alluring ads in her favorite fashion magazine about being thirty and flirty, she closes her eyes and wishes she was thirty. Soon she wakes up 30. She's completely thrilled, she has her own apartment and a job as a senior editor at the very magazine she read as a girl.  That's just the beginning ....

7669,"I think if you follow a restricted diet, you become accustomed to some types of foods.  If a person NOT on a restricted diet then tries those foods, s/he will not be entirely satisfied.  I kind of think these bars fall into that category.  They are organic, non-GMO, gluten free, Kosher, and vegan.  I have been exploring a lot more natural snack options lately, so I thought this was fine.  But I can see how some people would not like it.

It doesn't have a ton of flavor and mostly what flavor is there is cashew flavored.  So in that respect, this lives up to the cashew part of the ""golden cashew"" name.  It also has something of the texture of a date bar, and this does include dates as well.  It's a bit more crumbly/less sticky than many date bars, though.  (Actually, the texture is pretty soft...)

You can see the full ingredients list on the product page.  Nutrition information is available in the product images.  As expected, this is high in fat (from the nuts), but also protein and it has a fair amount of fiber.  Sugars are a little higher than I would like, and some of them are added (from the agave nectar).  However, this bar was not terribly sweet to me.

If you are trying to eat more whole foods or more raw foods, this is definitely worth a look.  Unlike most energy bars, this is pretty far from being a candy bar, I think (with the exception of the sugar levels).  With a piece of fruit, this might make a good breakfast or lunch if you don't have a lot of time.

738,"Maybe I'm a bit more tuned in but, despite a lot of research that went into this, I didn't really find this as thought-provoking as I thought I would. It's nothing new as to how advertisers try to manipulate us all. I would have preferred to learn whether that manipulation actually works backed by some statistical analysis. I'm sorry as someone who likes certain brands because they give good value, but who also is not swayed when it comes to other items no matter the brand (i.e., do I care what brand toilet paper I use?), I think this book is aimed too much at those who feel corporations are evil. In other words it preaches way too much to the converted.

OK, if that's your point of view, you'll love this book. I tend to think a product stands on its own merit, and maybe I'm in the minority when it comes to things like this. So be it. The fact that the author started out trying to live a life without any brand-name products just struck me as more stupid than a brilliant idea to kick off the discussion.

What this book needed was hard analysis of what brands do a good job both as a corporate citizen and offering a quality product. I felt the whole stuff on data mining complete nonsense and typical fear mongering. This whole notion that companies track what we spend has been going on even (shock! horror!) prior to the Internet. Plus if I'm going to have to deal with ads, I personally would rather have ads for things I'd be interested in than being forcefed ads the old way as on TV and radio (do I really need to know about feminine protection?).

Personally, Barry Glassner's Culture Of Fear was far better in explaining why people act the way they do although its focus was not exclusively on advertising.",1,"[0.7558213399223284, 0.37256351388382125, -0.7887985973481635, -1.0402900258747134, -0.9927277261338079]",0.7558213399223284

7622,"I have two of these cases because I can't make up my mind which color I liked best however, I've stopped using them. I have a Kindle Paperwhite 3G no ads and the case would wake my Kindle, as advertised, on opening. It didn't put it to sleep all the time though. When I use my Kindle I'd fold the front cover back and the magnets would hold it then I started having issues with my Kindle. It kept turning off on its own and then at one point I couldn't get to turn back on. When I say it kept turning off it was doing every 2 or 3 minutes. I checked my settings first and the Kindle wasn't set to turn off this quick. Then it finally turned off and I could not get it restarted. I had to plug it in and hold the power button for 30 seconds before I finally got a start screen. This happened again 2 more times in the same evening. The only thing new and different was the case, one of these, I had just put on it. I remember the trouble with the Kindle Keyboard cases/covers and wondered if this was a similar issue. After taking my Paperwhite out of this case/cover it's never pulled any of these tricks since. The case I'm using now is a Timbuk2 and it also has magnets but they don't power the Kindle off and on and are located in a bit different area. Unfortunately to say I no longer use these gorgeous cases/covers because they caused me Kindle to freak out.

3116,"Time marches on and another Pendergast novel hits the streets.  Unfortunately this one appears to primarily recycle characters that occasionally disappear and randomly reappear at convenient times.  Constance Greene is elevated to a main character, Proctor is fleshed out significantly, and even the busy-body Mrs. Trask has some meat added to her bones.  Howard Longstreet is introduced as an FBI investigator along with a backstory that ties in with that of our intrepid Special Agent.  And we are introduced to a female villain whose heart and mind reminds us of the dearly departed Diogenes.  But Aloysius, the slender white specter in the black suit, finds himself fully occupied elsewhere, joining the fray mid-point in the story.

There is no reason for me to tell you the story that other reviewers have already alluded to, especially since many of them have included spoilers that can ruin your hunches of where the action will lead.  But for some reason the story itself and its presentation seemed 'tired' to me, almost like the  authors had to really be creative and tried to wring out everything they could involving the characters and their interactions with each other.  Could it be that they simply 'tried too hard'?  Or, perish the  thought, has the Pendergast series finally worn itself out?

I have spent many (MANY) hours reading the works of these two authors, hours full of mystery, intrigue, unorthodox and imaginative crime solving, and the development of unique and complicated characters who have piqued my interest and entertained me time and time again.  The authors' writing remains the same, clear and concise, eloquent without being flowery, replete with subtle (and sarcastic) humor, taking the reader on a trip full of twists and turns that eventually arrives at a complicated ending -- usually one leaving the reader twisting in the wind until the next novel picks up the frayed ends.

I should say that I don't think that this is pushing at the extreme's of the dark genre.  And, whilst it was a little uncomfortable to read at times, it was a darkly compelling read.  I confess that when I had to put down my kindle to get some sleep, I was still itching to read it.  The author succeeding in creating characters and a relationship between them that I was invested in.

The one criticism that I do have about this  is that for me, the ending felt a little rushed, a little forced, perhaps not as organic as the rest of the story.  And although the ultimate resolution was satisfying, that point is reflected in my rating.

I received this beautiful book as an ARC. After reading it, I feel extremely lucky to have. This book was beautiful and Mariah's writing is so breathtaking. Sometimes I had to just breath in and out on certain parts because the words just hit the right spot. The words that take your breath away.. I love when they do.

This book is about a girl Lauren (LO) who moves to Oregon to go to school for her dream that neither her, dad, mother or brother support, and are quiet ugly about it. During this book you get a look into just how amazing of an artist she is, the way she looks at the world and studies it, then transfer it into art is amazing to experience in a book. I loved how she watched people, I loved how she pulled things from people that were unexpected. I think that was one of my favorite parts of this book to witness. So amazing. Lo goes to this party and meets this one man that will turn her world upside down and become the main focus of most of his art.

I love Mercedes..This little girl was just such a great added character that made this book that much better. I loved her and her dad and the way they just accepted and made Lo part of their family.

King..This man... part of him frustrated me. His hot and cold temperament drove me crazy. But he had these moments that were amazing, and he definitely has so many SWOON worthy moments, you will have to read to enjoy. I also love his relationship with his family.

I loved this story, I hated some of the stuff that happened, that made me want to slap some of the characters. But this book was definitely a great read.

It was an eye opener to know that God listens to everyone.  Even Mother Teresa - as much as we view her as the ""Super Christian"" struggled with how close she was with God...she even struggled with the idea if God even existed!

There is the bitter mother that rues the day she gave birth to a worthless girl, prostitute whose life was utterly pointless, the tailor lady that thought it ok to have a slave, the minister that was also a pimp on the side, the disloyal husband, the religious but hateful fanatic, and last, but certainly not least, an incredible spoiled brat, which is the heroine in this story.  The closest I came to feeling sorry or feeling anything at all for any of these characters was the slave.  Every other character in this book is a hypocrit.  The jolly prostitute may be the only exception.  She at least was honest about what she was and held her up and drank and was cheerful.  She did not feel the need to kill, steal, or hurt others to rise above her ""station"" in life.  All in all, this book disgusted me.  There was a little too much detail about the ""cullies"" (male customers) and the actual acts.  However, it was interesting to get a look at the non royal life.

Being a Hollywood heartthrob has its perks, and Ive damn sure enjoyed every one of them, both on and off the silver screen. The tabloids loved every second of exploiting my privacy, chronicling my mistakes in ink for the whole world to see. Accepting the lead role in a romantic dance film was guaranteed to make me a box office hit and help me rewrite my image, until the choreographer hired to train me turned out to be the only woman Id ever loved and lost.

As beautiful and enticing as ever, Teagan walks in and reminds me of the worst mistake Ive ever made. She should hate me, and now she has the power to destroy everything I am.

Teagan Reynolds is picking up the pieces
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twicenever going to happen. I fell in love with Reed Scott once and it nearly killed meliterally. The last thing I want to do now is teach him how to dance, but I need this job and theres no way Im letting him take yet another thing away from me.

Reed is in my world now, and this time were dancing by my rules.

Review:
A very passionate and emotional romance!

This is a story about loved lost and found again.  I loved the characters, both Teagan and Reed are hurting and by chance are thrown together again after years apart.  Teagan really does have lots of reasons for not trusting or wanting anything to do with Reed, he left her at the later for goodness sakes. But, love blooms again and knocks them both for a loop. Their biggest issue is overcoming both of their trust issues and putting aside past hurts and preconceived ideas to get to the place they both want to be, with each other.  This like the first book has the back drop of the entertainment industry , which lends to many interesting scenarios.
This a wonderfully written emotional romance with a few surprises. Sorry this is a short review, but I was trying to be spoiler free. I really loved the story, plot and Teagan and Reed and inhaled the book in one afternoon, I actually did not want it to end, but felt happy and satisfied when it did.

It is filled with caricatures - highly successful attorney, (and an ex-marine), with a near genius IQ; his girl Friday, a young attractive single mother with a heart of gold; street wise, sarcastic yet tenacious homicide detective; an ex-CIA agent who lives as a hermit; and self-important, over-zealous political types, (there are more but I won't belabor the point), - all involved in a predictable plot which degenerates into a Freud meets The Amazing Kreskin psychological farce. Every trick in the book is used to keep this story ""moving"" including short chapters ending at (in)opportune moments to keep the reader hanging on, lame wise-cracking by the protagonists during moments of crisis and of course, flashbacks. To top it all off it is painfully overwritten - eye-glazingly so - at over 400 pages this would have been a chore to finish at half that length.

1932,"While browsing in my bookstore, I came up with this book in my hands. In the back cover, the text was the same as one of the editorial reviews stated in this page, the one that ends with: ""... and his name is Jesus Christ"".
So I thought: relics theft, worldwide plague, human cloning, and Jesus Christ all in the same story. These are elements that could make a book great. I Bought it.
After reaching the end of the book, I was very disappointed. The back cover text is not true at all. ""Year zero"" is not an adventure nor a thriller, but more like a philosophical text about a world that was devastated by an ancient plague and the effort by those who were spared to quickly find a cure. Although Long's writing style is not bad, his plot and his characters are dull and boring. After the first 100 pages, which are indeed very interesting and set a premise that could be much more well developed, it's all downhill.
There are many books dealing on apocalypse-like and dead-end-for-humanity situations and many of them are better than ""Year zero"": ""The stand"", ""On the beach"" are just two of them.
If the editors had not wanted to create an adventure-like atmosphere to this book, maybe I would have set my mind on a different frame-reading, and then I could have enjoyed it much more. As it is, I didn't.

843,"Nothing bothers me more about a book than when the author drags out the conclusion until the very last page. This isn't my usual sort of trope because I don't like when there's OW/OM drama but it sounded like an ""arranged marriage"" sort of thing and I thought it wouldn't be a big issue.

I was wrong. The conflict between the hero and his ""betrothed"" took forever to resolve and although I was initially into the story between him and the heroine, it got old watching them vacillate between lust/love. I thought the whole ""class warfare"" shtick was overdone. I grew up in Southern Mississippi and even in 2002 (when the book was originally published) we're more progressed than that small minded ""You can't marry outside your class"", crap. I highly doubt Texas would be worse than us but I digress.

I've read another series by this author before and enjoyed it tremendously and don't know what she was thinking with this book. The characters were juvenile, milquetoast beta males/females with no backbone who thought with their genitalia. The first half was decent enough to continue but it got worse the longer I read. Several breaks were needed to slog through it until the end because by the time I realized I wanted out it was already too late. There was a lot that got on my nerves with the story but I will say the end was somewhat sweet but too long in arriving. The wrap-up was decent but for all the sh#t you have to dig to find, it's not worth it.

The Nesco racks were filled with the venison cut into strips after preparing with a jerky mix. I was unable to use the mix provided by Nesco since it contains MSG which I and about 10% of the population is allergic to. I was disappointed that Nesco still provides this mix with the Dehydrator since it will make many people get headaches, etc. The dehydrator worked very well and is reasonably quiet and I guess that's what is most important for me. I do like the square shape, it makes sense to me since things like jerky fit into it very well. I plan to try the dehydrator with apples next.

They respect each other, they are growing a business together, electricity sparks when they are together and now they decide to grow their family.  The competitive nature of the men, and the emotional aspects before and during are well-played.

When Shannon does get pregnant (I do not think that is a spoiler) the gloves come off.  This is only so funny because it is all so true.  Pregnancy is not for the faint of heart and this couple goes through so many aspects in truly real-life yet humorous fashion.  From an aversion to coffee (they own and run coffee shops), to the hormonal emotions of being pregnant;
  That whole concept that by week forty youll tolerate being split in half just to get it all over with?
  It seems ludicrous at six weeks.  Now?  Not so much.

Russo brings us back to North Bath, New York.  This time the story is focused on Doug Raymer.  Doug was a supporting character in Nobodys Fool, but now he is front and center.  Doug is the chief of police and spends most of his time trying to find the man who is wife was about to leave him for when she fell down the steps and died.

The novel is filled with slices of life that Richard Russo does so well.  He weaves humor expertly through the whole novel.  You really start to feel like you know these people as people not just characters in a book.

The only thing that I didn't like about the novel was that Russo kept trying to get the reader up to speed on what had happened in Nobodys Fool.  It reminded me of how they talk in soap operas, where they try and keep the viewer up on the story, like Oh, theres John, he looks well even though he fell in the well after chasing the thief who robbed the bank last year and then married his daughter.  Thats not a real example, but there was too much of that going on.  I don't think it was necessary.

425,"My lastest audio book in the car was Break No Bones by Kathy Reichs. The main character was the inspiration for the Fox tv show Bones. I love the show, so I was prepared to love the books.

I hate the book. The only thing it has in common with the show is the character name and field of occupation.

The book has a lot of extraneous, rambling information that contributes nothing to the story. It starts out very slow, and doesn't get into the story very quickly. I listened to several chapters while trying to decide if I was going to bother listening to the rest.

I did listen to the whole story. It did have a bit of a twist at the end, but most of it was predictable and boring. It could have been cut in half, and the story would probably have improved.

If you are a fan of the show, I would suggest you avoid the books completely. They are very disappointing and have nothing in common with the show.",0,"[-0.05786360115679012, 0.645099842479254, -0.05095608075487057, -1.0417663861607782, -1.8390682781509657]",0.645099842479254

I've already downloaded book 4 but thought I'd write this review rather quickly. I liked this trilogy set. It has a nice storyline and an ending by book three so if you want to stop reading you can, without a huge finale cliffhanger weighing on your curiosity. ;)  the series begins with a few main characters and then it blossoms pretty quickly to quite a few. There are a couple of times when I found myself a bit confused toward the end when we don't know exactly what's going on (under the storyline) until the very end. Besides that, I enjoyed the characters, their relationships, etc.

Edits: written well with only a few missed or extra words.
Age group: adults due to profanity (although otherworldly wording, i.e.. ""frek"" , which I must say, I really appreciate. It doesn't seem to me as if they're actually cussing when done this way but merely shouting their displeasure.) Also, there's sexual content &/or referral to sex, military battles, violence against other person's.
Book Cover: I like that the author placed all three covers on this trilogy book cover. I think it makes it obvious that this is a trilogy set and not merely 1 book of the Trilogy.

Although it is called Amethyst in color, I think in person it is more reddish than Amethyst. The feeder holds about 1 1/2 to 2 cups of seed, so it actually holds less seed than it appears as you look at it. Although it speaks of having a wide mouth into which the seed is poured, it has a fairly narrow opening. For this reason it is easiest to fill with a birdseed scoop with a chute.

Now to the reason, I can't give it five stars. There are four little drainage holes with a diameter of less than a toothpick. I actually used a round toothpick to determine this. One of my attached pictures shows three of the four drainage holes so you can see how tiny they are. When we had rain, the feeder did not drain rapidly enough and the water backed up into the seed.

Tom Hazard has lived for over 500 years, but has he REALLY been living? There's so much pain and sorrow that he's holding on to over the centuries, so much fear that he refuses to let go of.

He's lost the most important people in his life, and he's let himself be seduced by an evil man masquerading as his savior. This story is a look back on the most important moments of his very, very long life, and the realization that there's more to life then just 'staying alive'.

I loved taking this journey with Tom. I was so sorry to have to say goodbye to him when the story was over. This is a book (for me at least) that will stay with you long after you finish it. I have recommended this book to EVERYONE. I absolutely loved it, and plan to re-read it again soon. I feel like there is so much to this book, that in re-reading it, I'll discover things that I may have missed the first time around.

For the first half of the book, you are introduced to the biggest Regency prude heroine you've ever read about. And you don't like her, at first. You almost decide to give up on the whole book, especially because there's a lot of history about Samuel to the point of it being slightly boring and needing to skip pages. But in the second half, their relationship takes a turn. And in chapter 17, just when you're about to give up on the book again, you're taken into an erotic scene of pure love.

123,"Given the lavish praise for _100 Years of Solitude_, I am gravely disappointed and frustrated.  At the risk of being burned in effigy (or in the very least pilloried as a philistine), wading through Marquez was a real test of my patience and literary fortitude.

The story was a difficult read, which I don't mind, so long as there is a reward for my efforts.  I found no such relief here.  Stylisitically it was an abomination: paragraphs that run one, two, two and a half pages long?!  This was worse than Faulkner, as at least with him there is conflict (and resolution) in his writing.  In _100 Years of Solitude_, the initial investment of 100 pages is that the following 300 pages are more or less a rehash of the first quarter of the book.  The characters have almost identical names, and make many of the same decisions and actions as their namesakes.  Beyond being repetitive, I found it mindnumbingly dull.  Adding to the sense of drugery I experienced, was the geologic pace of the book.

To be fair to the legions of fans of Marquez, I ""get"" magical realism - in fact, I enjoyed elements of it here.  I also understand his point that history is ""cyclical"" (although I don't happen to agree with him on this), and that this explains not only the similarities in name but also in behaviour by his characters.  A strong case could be made for Jung's ""collective memory"" in the book, given the actions (and in several cases, literal ""hereditary memory"") of the many Arcadios and Aurielianos ; heck, I can even see how one could argue that Marquez is showing the existential crisis of the individual - that, in spite of our best efforts, we are all alone, daily wrestling with our solitude.  And perhaps it is precisely because of these clues that this is so beloved by so many.  All that aside, I didn't enjoy the book at all and had to force myself to return to it again and again in order to finish.  With his book, at least, I am puzzled at the high regard with which it is held.",1,"[-1.7587876916772154, 0.6183480144755176, -0.38069034503370147, -1.0310861824899225, -2.232181254588763]",0.6183480144755176

I really like that the author wrote a story about a love that is so strong and worth the fight and battles that most have to go through. I think everyone will relate to not necessarily the exact situations Liam and Meara are put in, but more so just the fact that love is not easy and sometimes you have to dig in with all you have, hold on tight, and fight with every breath in your body. Liam and Meara have that kind of love. A love that I think most crave and wish for forever. This book is a true testament of ""nothing worth having is ever easy."" I LOVE Liam and Meara both and rooted for them the whole way through. I started this book over morning coffee and didn't put it down until it was over.

Im normally not one of those sentimental and emotional people when it comes to books, but this one really touched me.

Author Seth King is a definite force to be reckoned with, as he is able to pull your heart apart by the seams and put it back together in a bittersweet fashion!!

I loved this story as I was reminded of our precious moments in this life and not taking anything for granted. Summer and Coopers story astounded me with its portrayal how in one blink of an eye, everything can change or be taken away!! Such a strong yet delicate testament of growing pains and undying friendship and true love!

I seriously recommend this gem of a read as it brought forth a lot of hidden aggression and nostalgia for me and made me re-think and analyze things from a different perspective.

You see...Three years ago, I had lost my little brother. If he were alive today, he would be 19 years old and was unexpectedly taken away from my family and myself. Although I miss him everyday and still get teary eyed over his absence, his memories will forever prevail in my and the rest of my familys hearts.

The Summers Remains was definitely an epiphany for me as it allowed me to heal and cope with my personal loss and revel in lifes defining moments and its utter heartbreaks, lessons, and wreckage.

In fact, I wish Mr. Tarantino would make several more such movies, playing fast and loose with various periods of history until we get it through our heads that doing this opens up creative avenues of insight and adventures that we currently deny ourselves.  Authors in previous ages certainly wouldn't have scrupled.

But the thing seems thematically uneven to be considered great.  From what I read, Tarantino took 10 years to write this, and it shows.  They say you shouldn't take that long to write something, because there are too many changes in the author himself during such a time.  Thus what you finally come up with is likely to be stylistically and thematically clunky.  (Think of Moby-Dick:  unfortunate that the author went through so many changes while writing that.)

It's like Tarantino was at times trying to do this, at other times trying to do that.

the movie itself, just like ellroy's novel, even it was deemed as the best of ellroy's, is so pretentiously noir, noir, overly noir, added some yellowish, brownish lens to imitate that era with chain-smoking people, hats...lousy background music that usually come with disney cartoons, ended this movie up in a messy shape.  not even you've read or re-read the novel first, you still didn't quite get it, no matter what and, couldn't have cared less.

So I guess that's something so say. Did I like Jon? Yes, I thought he was a great character. Did I like Liam? Of course I did. What they shared was hot and adorable in its on way.
However, what I didn't like was too much repetitive sex scenes. They weren't much different from the next. I'd sworn I'd just read the same one fifteen pages before. So that left me a little blah about them. Although they were decent and 70% erotically hot. And I'm not saying this because I don't like a lot of sex in my books- Generally, I do. However, that being said, I still want a variety.
The story itself was written well for the most part. Except the constant overuse of ""Oh My God"", spine  tingling and shivers. Sometimes they were used multiple times per page which really made them stand out- and not in a good way. I personally think the author needs to incorporate a little more vocabulary into their sex scenes to make them more fluid and much less repetitive. A good editor should have helped with that.
I kind of knew every single thing before it would happen because the element of suspense wasn't really there for me. I was just waiting for Jon to catch up my thoughts about the situations. It took a while and he had to be told my Liam.
As a whole- I liked the story.
I would recommend this author and this book.
It's my first read by this author and I will be checking out more of their work.

P.S. The Best Man aspect was there but wasn't the whole focus of the story. Craig, the ex is a jerk and I knew what was going to happen with that. I was right. It was pathetic of Craig. That part I enjoyed. Although, his new to be wife was kind of a bit** to Jon for no reason.

4567,"I really enjoyed this book, however I had some major issues that kept bugging me no matter how hard I tried to get over it. I know it's really small, and won't bother the majority of people , but in Unexpected Fate, Liam didn't have an accent. All of a sudden he kept saying ""Darlin'"" and it drove me nuts. I kept having to try not to read it with a southern accent. I'm from the south, and no guy I've ever met has said ""Darlin'"". It's not really a big deal, and I don't know why it annoyed me so much but it did. I also wish I could've seen his relationship with Molly more. I also didn't really feel like Megan was head over heels with Liam. She was kind of snappy at the beginning, which I understand because she lost her husband and was sensitive, but some of it felt really rude to me. The time table of this book also threw me for a loop: half of the book talks about knowing each other for about a year, and then on one page it says two?? I don't know why that also annoyed me. I was really surprised that I felt all of this, because I have always loved Sloan's books. Those issues being aside, this book did make me cry a lot no matter how hard I tried not to. I could feel a lot of emotion from Megan and that she had a huge support system she wanted to let in, but couldn't. I would recommend this book if you like Harper sloans novels and I also think it's not a total waste of money; while it wasn't my favorite, I still think I would read it again because my issues aside, it was a good book.

I absolutely love this series! I devoured Hardpressed. The writing is fantastic and the characters are amazing, especially Blake Morgan. He is definitely book boyfriend material! He's the sexy alpha male 100% all the way!

Hardpressed starts off where Hardwired left off and it had me hooked from the very beginning.  Erica is busy trying to get her business established while fighting off the hacker that keeps messing with her site. She doesn't want Blake to interfere, she wants to be able to do things for herself. This causes some conflict with their relationship. Add into the mix that Blake is a dominant male and can't do what he wants to Erica because of her past, leads to some very angsty moments.

At the 60% mark my heart was in my throat and it didn't leave that position until the very end! AT 70%  my heart broke. It shattered in little teeny tiny pieces! But don't worry folks, Meredith was able to put those tiny pieces back together by the end.

934,"The criticisms of this book's portrayal of a large government funded science project are not only accurate - they are mild. I'm surprised that the author let it go at that. I mean the idea that roughly a dozen personnel man a huge project in total isolation doing their own laundry, frying up their own spuds and cleaning each others' toilets is silly beyond belief.

Add that this supposedly $40B project sits with no security except a fence which is easily broken down and you find a book difficult to read due to the forced eye rolling it induces. OK, that's out of the way.

The big issue among some reviews and also pushed strongly by the publisher is that this book is either anti-religion in general or anti-Christian specifically. The latter due to the zealotry depicted among Christian believers which leads to violence when they think they are in an actual war.

This isn't anti-Christian. It's fact. If you are a Christian, you can make a great deal of noise about love this or kindness that, but the fact is that to be a Christian is to believe that there will be a war at the End of Days between the Believers and the Blasphemers led by The Anti-Christ. That's what Christianity is. That's the POINT of believing - so you are on the side of the righteous, fight on Jesus' side and win, as your reward, a seat at His table.

This belief set has the obvious potential that true believers may mistake various signs that the End of Days is upon us and go to war with no Anti-Christ yet manifested.

So while I can't see much reality in the scientists or the theology in this book, it's a good exciting read (which really is the point, isn't it?) and to me, anyway, the depiction of the Christian movement is, if not complimentary, at least more realistic than the science part.

It is not as good as the chocolate varieties, as chocolate is the best flavor to mask these types of beverages. However, I get tired of chocolate after a while. So this is a great substitute to give your taste buds some variety.

I have a problem with constipation due to having to take antihistamines during hayfever season. This gave me some relief from that problem while getting some protein in a convenient and healthy manner.

This rug is well made and the low pile means that I can actually open my french doors when it is down. Eureka! finally a rug that doesn't bunch up when opening the door. This looks like a much more expensive rug and today when my neighbors were over they fell in love with it.  It is supposed to be stain resistant which I haven't tried yet (thankfully) but it seems like it would be. The leaf design makes quite a statement but is not too big or gaudy.

569,"A book dubbed as a one volume look at Napoleon Bonaparte. The problem with the book is the subject matter is probably too vast for one book. Several books on him could be written which would provide better detail an explanations of events and the people around him. It feels like at times that it is Napoleon with some friends that we've never met before.

The author obviously knows his subject matter well and has a good grasp of the military exploits of Napoleon. The problem is that the reader does not. Generals are mentioned with no context. By the end of the book I still knew nothing about any of them. Town names are used all over the place that mean nothing to the reader. It becomes boring and confusing. The maps provided in the kindle version are small and unreadable.

In the end, two or three books on Napoleon are needed for such a large and transforming person. I certainly understand what the author was trying to do by writing just one book and hoping that it would become ""THE"" book about Napoleon, but something didn't work.",2,"[-2.1191722921151803, 0.5588526281515143, -0.09516913539479521, -1.0401961775561221, -1.9270683449012442]",0.5588526281515143

714,"Just wrote an extensive review on my blog, Prolific Living, but a few thoughts for Amazon friends:

Seth Godin needs no introduction. A world class marketer, a best-selling author of a dozen books, an unmatched voice of influence, not to mention a sincerely genuine person on every interview and interaction. He is too good to be real and yet so real, it's hard to believe.

Even so, I did put the book down. I even came close to shipping it off to a friend but I came back to it. I read it. I finished it. I devoured it. I loved it.
Brilliant thoughts expressed in simple form and through stories and facts and experiences. After reading it, you examine your every move; you look at your decisions with fresh new perspective, and you wonder why no one else told you to do ""emotional work"" and called you an artist all these years when you were trying to give your art to the world. And why you let the ""lizard brain"" have so much power over your plans and prospects. I have now come to know my lizard brain and I have seen evidence of my linchpin within. What about you?

To permanently shut off the lizard brain may take a long time but recognizing the things that stand in the way of our dreams is the first step toward greatness.

So what does it take to be the linchpin, to become truly indispensable? Is it to write endlessly, to create daily, to be original and authentic and to do it day in and day out tirelessly? Is it to dig deep and find one single genius idea and spend the rest of your days on bringing it to life? Or is it going through one bad idea after another until a good one emerges?",4,"[-0.9397654958362613, -1.644977576230049, -1.7658976782255549, -1.0667441129932655, 0.556586535535345]",0.556586535535345

3396,"I liked the story.  But what I really loved was the hero:  he was very alpha, but never abusive, had no commitment issues, and was willing to admit his love (if not to the heroine), at least to himself.  I liked the heroine for the most part, she was beautiful and sassy, and although vulnerable, she stood for herself, she was definitely no doormat.  I also appreciated very much, that she did not fall instantly in lust with the hero, and that from then on  her body would twitch this way and that way with uncontrolable desire, every time she saw him or thought about him.

There were three reasons I did not give this book 4 stars.  First I almost felt as if the author was under-estimating the reader, I mean the heroine can sense what a person was thinking/feeling, but she could not detect the hero's love for her, Really??  Which brings me to my second reason:  about half way through the book,, the story reverts to the old theme that I hate:  ""heroine is in dispair because the hero does not love her"".  The hero does love her, he just kind of neglected to tell her.  And finally, the last part of the book, seemed a bit ""cheesy"", at least to me.
