Right out of the box, the first thing I discovered was the defective glass lid. It didn't even come close to fitting the slow cooker, and was so far off that it rattled constantly while the cooker was in use.

The next problem occurred when my wife discovered a burning rubber odor, which failed to go away after multiple uses.

The third issue was the fact that the slow cooker was never capable of fully cooking the food placed in it. My wife cooked chicken breasts, but after the suggested time was reached, the chicken pieces were still raw in the middle.

I thought that KitchenAid was a manufacturer of premium products. If this slow cooker is any indication, they certainly have a problem on their hands.

The bottom line is that the KitchenAid slow cooker that I received, had three noticeable defects. This rendered it unusable and I returned it to Amazon for a refund.",1,"[1.6306356307557441, 2.584027770338032, -0.5011181410315138, -1.0500350868056554, -1.7102077179719317]",2.584027770338032

Certainly the most confusing movie I've seen, this film instantly landed a spot in the top 5 worst films I have fallen victim to.

How did it get made?  That's the real mystery.  There weren't better scripts out there?  I could write a better script if I simply sat on the keyboard.  (Believe it or not, after this turd, somebody actually gave this guy money to direct another movie -- although not based on his script.)

It's like they gave a 14-year-old kid millions of dollars to make a movie and a single afternoon to write a script.  The script has no ideas or insight about anything -- terrorism, war, the media, the political machine, Marxism, you name it.  The movie is impossible to take literally (everybody's looking for Boxer, yet he can just go to a sidewalk cafe?), yet has nothing coherent to say on any allegorical level.

There are too many characters and the connections between them are unclear.  That voiceover guy seems to never stop introducing the movie, which initially reassures you since you're constantly confused, but clarity never comes.

Plus it just goes on forever.  Supposedly Andrew O'Hehir called this film ""about the biggest, ugliest mess I've ever seen.""  Lou Lumenick of the New York Post wrote of it, ""If a more incoherent and self-indulgent movie has been released so far this century, I'm not aware of it.""",1,"[1.3534144146174143, 2.2714280021985944, 0.04800645651896329, -1.0939775549909696, -1.4317217739544623]",2.2714280021985944

Koontz knows how to keep a reader interested and turning the pages, but the book slows down and as the killer and his plot unfolded I found myself disappointed. The suspense collapses near the end and the book left me with a feeling of ambivalence when I finished reading the story.

It's worth reading, but Koontz has written better books.",1,"[0.6597607786037829, 1.6874829521035033, -0.200307306274649, -0.9993283322482952, -2.038450078373143]",1.6874829521035033

The next thing I noticed was the flimsiness of the metal connector rods. Yes they were easy to insert one into the other and they were just as easy to fall out. I placed the unit into a large garden container and when I went to pull it out the bottom connector remained well inside the soil. So I glued everything together. Now at least it won't fall apart.

The top is nice, the spiral that holds the gauge is nice looking-- the gauge will fall out if the unit is tilted so place it firmly in the ground. I have yet to see what the wind will do to the gauge.

This was a dark twisted page turner and I loved every single page!!!

Tess and Brax have been together for years and they take an anniversary trip to Mexico ... While in Mexico Tess decides to reveal that she needs more in the bedroom from Brax!

""I wanted a new label. One that said: girlfriend who will do anything to be tied, spanked, and f***ed all over rather than adored.""

Brax well he's not into more so Tess leaves well enough alone ...

Meanwhile also on vacation Tess is kidnapped by human traffickers and sold as a slave!!

Through out the book Tess suffers at the hands of the traffickers but through it all becomes one strong woman and I fell in love with her character !! Q while obviously a little dark, twisted, and a dark erotic appetite well I fell in love with him too!!

Updated to a Razr M and it was good for about 4 months, then a couple weeks ago I started getting errors saying the card had been removed when it hadn't. At first a phone power down would get it working again, but after a couple weeks the phone refused to recognize the card as being installed at all. A 16G card from another manufacturer is instantly recognized and mounts and unmounts flawlessly. Tried the card in a USB flashcard reader with my PC, first time the card was recognized but with no data available. Tried unplugging and reinserting the card reader and other than that first time, the card has been unrecognized. At this point have to assume the card is dead. I'll give it 2 stars because while it was working it was very quick. I loaded about 400 CDs worth of MP3s onto the thing through my phone in about an hour, which was impressive to say the least.

Update: I got a Rosewill card reader the other day, and I was amazed that it was able to read this card again, and all the old data was intact. I have copied and pasted to and from the card.

A loooong masterful tenseness that literally made me scream. There's some very nasty surprises in here for people who haven't read these characters and realize this IS what they live with, every day it seems.  Some past characters truly get their just desserts. Good to know the bad guys will get theirs, even if it is a long time coming. Secondly, there is a man road trip. With a naked Homeboy. I swear, that had me giggling long into the night!

Another reviewer commented on having the hyperlinks going to the book rather than a short blurb as was done in an earlier book. Very frustrating as when I read I'm not connected to the Internet.

There is marital discord in this book that may be unsettling to readers of previous books who haven't read them all in a week. *I* could tell them what the problem was; however, the couple in question figured it out for themselves. But it took a while, and only when . . . well, you'll have to see for yourself. Sheesh.

One thing I HATED -- in Kindle books -- those you get from Amazon -- there is a place to review the book before you close it and forget what the book was about. (That's why this isn't a better review!) In the copy I downloaded, there was no such page.  Bad, bad publisher.  Whoever. Put that back in following books.  Please. Because now I have to jump over to Goodreads and post this review.

I see I have Last Call to read before I get into the rest of Mr. Konrath's writings. I may read those before I read that, because I don't want the enjoyment to end.  I have thoroughly loved this series. This is one of the best.

Previously I'd used a regular memory foam pillow (not shredded) and it caused my ears to fall asleep, which is really weird and very painful.  This pillow supported my back and neck perfectly.  I even found that lying on my stomach worked out if I put my upper body on part of the pillow as well.  I woke up with no aches or pains like I do from regular pillows.  It's also really nice to just have one pillow instead of stacking up several flatter pillows.

As others have stated, it has a strong smell and is hard to get out of the zippered case.  It is also hard to get into a king sized pillow case.  The smell does go away eventually and I didn't find it terribly objectionable.

Others have also stated that it's only the outer case that's made of bamboo and the inside is just regular shredded foam.  I don't really care what it's made out of since it's a great pillow.

I don't feel like we got to witness enough of the relationship buildup to make me invested in the couple (Dom and Denise).Dom was a very smart and intelligent young man but at times he was whinning and spoiled. The demons ( raped by his father) he was struggling with took entirely too long to reveal and he was a little creepy with his infatuation to Denise. He was rejected, but he took it gracefully but his action resulted almost like a stalker thing. Denise said she is a virgin; however, after there rumble she jumped up with no problem???Maybe I just totally missed something but I thought this was suppose to be an interracial book but the more I read, the more it is not??Overall, I did read it to the end, but sadly, it was extremely disappointing and didn't make the cut!!!",1,"[0.36056232907577956, 1.5489796893697374, -0.08625645773181811, -1.0397327615902814, -2.213893814837396]",1.5489796893697374

Finally in this book we get to sort of a resolution to the problem set out in ""Hostage"".  The issue here is that problem is almost lost in the minutia as well as overall topic of Black Ops.  Its like Griffin got side tracked by his own novel.  He got so enthused about Charlie doing this and Charley doing that that he forgot about what he started to do four books ago.  Certainly Griffin has created some amusing characters and filled them out partially (but not  perfectly).  I get the impression he was trying to achieve the same sort of run on effect as Diana Gabaldon's Outlander where your fans are just waiting for your next edition to grab it.  Griffin just doesn't achieve that status.  His characters are a bit flat, and I'm not so in love with the novels that I can overlook  the fact that a lot of the book was totally transitory to the story arc and didn't really add anything.  I am also unwilling to overlook that the real action of the story happens in less than 10% of the book and maybe only 5%.  If you're reading this review, then you've probably already covered the other 5 books in the series, thus you either agree with me or you're willing to overlook these faults because you enjoy the minutia of the story.

What I liked about the book- Carrie, the heroine was the perfect balance, not a virgin but not a hoe, a lady in the streets but a freak behind closed doors and a professional in a business meeting. She wanted Gavin to work for it and he made moves to make things happen but it wasn't easy, at least for what she thought it wasn't. Now Gavin was what every typical hero is in an erotic romance novel- filthy rich, alpha male, sexy, gorgeous and mysterious! They are both mysterious but the book is so short, you get excited for the sex scene but that was about it. Cause when something comes up.. the end of the book is here and your left saying seriously?
What I didn't like- it was short, cliffhanger ending was bad and it was missing something.. I guess that was the point but now I have to get hooked and pay the $0.99 to find out what happens, but I will see about getting any more.

9291,"This film reminds me of Gaspar Noe's Irreversible, in that it's initially an assault on the senses, and you feel as if you've seen great filmmaking because of it.  When I revisisted Irreversible recently, I found out I'd been had.  Noe's film is just an assault on the senses with nothing in its core.  Aronofsky's film, while nowhere as overly graphic, sadistic or disgusting as Irreversible, has this same quality.

As many have said here, the main message here is a very simplistic one, DRUGS ARE BAD.  It's almost on the level of an after school special, and that's a shame, as Aronofsky has a very good visual and editing style, but after nearly 2 hours of it, it's overkill.  I felt totally numbed after seeing this film.  I sat in my car afterwards, and I couldn't move.  But aside from the pure visceral experience of the film (which feels like a drug, the drugs the movie is telling us not to use), there isn't much left there.  There's some depth in Ellen Burstyn's character (she gives a great performance), but I believe that has to do with the fact this is based on Hubert Selby Jr.'s book.  If there is any humanism in this film, it's derived from the novel, not Aronofsky, who is like a kid with his new toy.  The characters of Leto and Connelly are especially bad, especially Connelly.  She is supposed to be a junkie, but she looks way too beautiful to be one.  Overall, the film is worth watching at least once, but it's essentially a visceral assault on your senses and little else.

A funny sidenote...Before this film screened (I saw it in a theater), the theater was playing The Wallflowers's album Breach, which is one of my favorite albums of theirs.  After I recovered from this assault, I kept thinking about how wonderful and tuneful those songs were, and I pretty much forgot about Aronofsky's film (until I wrote this review).  I bought Breach, and it's one of my favorite albums.  Thanks, Darren...",1,"[0.27281945248650064, 1.414067525550231, -0.5921561312542711, -1.0527600943220992, -1.1190451701879822]",1.414067525550231

3831,"Here's the perfect way to describe the forgetableness of this book. Last night I finished a book and went to bed, with the intention of reviewing it this morning. This morning, I took my Kindle to the gym and started this book while on the stationary bike. When I got home, I reviewed the book I finished last-night and then sat down to look at my Kindle Collections to pick out what to read next, completely forgetting that I had started and read 30% of this book already. It made that little of an impression. When I finally remembered having already started it, I sat down to finish it up.

Now, don't misunderstand me. I'm not necessarily saying it was a bad book. I'm sure we've all read those books that we don't love, but we don't hate either. They're like cotton candya shot of sweetness that you can only savour for a moment and then leaves very little memory of itself. Yep, that's what this book was like.

Seeing the emotionless Tristan become attached to someone was nice. The fact that Rachel wasn't a complete pushover was appreciable. Her ultra-protective brother was fun. There were plenty of 'aww' moments and the sex was pretty mild.

However, quite a lot of the plot was just skimmed over or just plain unbelievable. For example, I'm still unsure why Aidan called Tristan to guard Rachel in the first place, other than that he disliked her fianc. That seems a little extreme. As far as I can tell there was no actual risk to Rachel that Aidan would have been trying to protect her against.

There is also a lot of history between the older generation of characters that isn't explored. The science isn't well explained. And the romance is lightning fast. It isn't insta-love, but within a matter of a day or so Tristan and Rachel fall madly in love and are willing to essentially throw their established lives away to be together. It too seems a bit extreme.

For a quick, fluffy read, this is worth picking up. If you're looking for great literature....um, it probably won't fit the bill. It does actually end, though. Yes, that's right, no cliffhanger!",1,"[1.0171685943830433, 1.351597738863879, -0.3623680810760791, -1.0439441811772492, -1.6873468626921637]",1.351597738863879

I turned this on at 55% for my bedroom for comfort, and it immediately went to work. I slept comfortably and noticed when I was awake that once the humidity was down in my bedroom, it clicked off. As another storm passed and the humidity gathered, it went back on.

It has a quiet hum, but nothing noticeable in my opinion, and it did not interfere with my sleep, listening to music, or watching a movie.

I have tried every bread knife and slicing guide on the market. Most work fine. (The Mercer bread knife on Amazon  is the best.). It wasn't the knives or the guides, it was ME. I couldn't slice evenly no matter what I did. One end thick, the other thin, you know what I'm talking about right?

When this slicer arrived I had 3 loaves waiting. One was a no knead loaf with a very crunchy, crusty exterior, another a very soft Challah egg bread, and the third, ciabatta rolls.  I had to experiment, of course, to get the right thickness for me. I found that the 12 & 1/2  notch area on the dial made  about a 1/2"" slice and was just right.

The loaves were a bit too big for the pronged pusher at first, so I very carefully sliced off the first three pieces before using it to hold the breads in place. Yes, it's much better to follow the rules and cut the loaf in half to use with the pusher, but well, I was anxious to see how it worked. Talk about impressive! The loaves were sliced into PERFECTLY EVEN slices in a matter of seconds!  Yes, SECONDS!  I knew at that moment that I should not have hesitated getting this slicer.

I got over my thinking that I'll only use this for bread, and I  tried a yam that I had on hand. Wow, yam chips in an instant. I raided the vegetable bin and sliced cabbage, a russet potato, and an onion. I was a slicing fool. I wasn't looking forward to the clean up but it turned out to be less of a bother than I thought.

When Paddy (De Niro) sees Billy again old problems come up, and once again a woman comes between them. I have to admit that even with this cast I was not excited about this one. Like many others I was expecting another Hangover type movie but with older people. The reason I try not to watch trailers is because they either give too much away or misrepresent the movie. This one is the later. They played it up like a Hangover movie but watching it this turned out to be so much more. While there was the obvious drinking and sex aspect this one did have a grown up plot and the fact that these four actors were in it really brought the level up from juvenile to real movie. Nothing against the Hangover movies because I liked the first and third one and if I were to compare this to another movie it would be those but this one did have a more grown-up feel.

This story could have been written about the kingdom of Anyplace, with King Anybody and Lady Anyone, and it wouldn't have made one bit of difference. Next, the book is not nearly as clever nor as funny as the authors seem to think it is. And the bits where the authors step in and directly address the reader also felt like an unnecessary gimmick. Finally, I had a hard time getting into the book. I started and stopped so many times during the first third to half of the book that it took me forever to get to the more engaging last half.

Getting past the crankiness, this is a cute book with likeable heroes and heroines, a bit of magic, bad guys who get what they deserve (more or less), and a happily ever after ending.

I can hardly believe it myself, even as I'm typing it out. I skipped entire paragraphs of a David Weber Space Battle because it was boring? How can that be?

I liked the plot of this book. I even like the complicated mix of characters, politics, diplomacy, family, and military action that has become the Honor Harrington series. I don't mind one bit that Honor was not the focus of the entire or even the majority of the book because I have grown fond of the other characters of the Honorverse and actually like reading about them.

The female protagonist, Autumn, was an uptight, prudish librarian with a stick up her ass. While many authors are able to take such a character and make their antics comical or endearing, this author did neither.  The male lead was also unimpressive. He was an arrogant, sadistic, ass that got off on toying with Autumn under the guise of conducting research for his latest novel. Any attempt to portray him as a sexy, dominant alpha-male fell short by miles.

What you're left with is 2 characters that you don't like, a predictable plot and so-so sex scenes. The story failed to evoke any emotion, probably because there was absolutely no connection to the characters. The ending was lukewarm at best and didn't come nearly quick enough.

His character is really unlikeable, but the director never clearly tilts us in favor of either his mom or his fiance (who gets stuck between the two of them during a trip to California), and thus the film feels unfocussed and shambling.

871,"For me, Room was not an easy read. Not for the content so much, but more because of the voice and limited vocabulary of a five-year-old narrator. I cant say that I got used to it, but eventually I got to the point where I could tolerate Jacks narrative.

I went into Room blind  not having read the book description or knowing what the story is about  so it took me a while at the start to understand whats going on. I think it was better that I didn't know, because as the story unfolded and realization dawned, it had a greater impact on me.

The reasons why Im not giving Room a full five-star-rating, is because of the difficult narrative, for one, but also because some of the content  which I feel didn't advance the plot, or add to the story in any way  made me feel uncomfortable, and sometimes made my stomach churn (like Jack sucking on his mothers rotted tooth, and then searching his poo for it when he lost it). I don't really want to go into more specifics here, because I don't want to give any spoilers; but also because the issues I had with some of the things Jack does or constantly refers to, are things I personally don't approve of or would not allow for my own children, as Ma did for Jack (although I do understand their circumstances were much different).

Other than that, I think Room was an incredibly insightful read and gave me lots to think about. I felt the last half of the book shouldve included Mas voice as well to fully get her perspective on how shes dealing with their ordeal, but Im also glad that I got to see the outside world from Jacks point of view.

There is rape, death, ow drama, there is loss of friends. It was just entirely too much in this story.

There was also a bit of victim blaming. Damien indicated that she let herself get caught. This also was stupid to me.

Hercules as a story has been done many times before both as a movie and in television.  Unfortunately for this movie, it has been done much better before.  With poor casting, poor acting and overacting and herky jerky filming with its gratuitous use of slow motion (almost felt like I was in a Matrix movie.), this movie almost felt B-grade quality even though it had a 70 million dollar budget...  I mean like seriously 2 decades pass and Queen and King don't age a day? You couldn't actually add some makeup to make it believable that two decades passed??

Some of the fight sequences are ok but the way it is filmed (what the heck is that stuffed lion looking thing??)just annoyed me and gave me a headache instead of being truly enjoyable and the characters and actor choices just didn't work for me.

This book had everything I look for in a book. It was definitely a page turner. Keeping my hooked from beginning to the end. This book has everything I enjoy in a great read! It was full of angst, heartbreak, love romance, and my stomach was on a roller coaster of feelings and I loved it.

This book really centers around Chloe and Gavin. They are childhood best friends, that love each other. But because of different circumstances and people. They never really act on their feelings. Through out this book you will see these two fight what they feel and be afraid to show them,  These two story like any good book will leave you frustrated.  Watching them miss opportunities and watching the stubbornness that lead to miss moments was sometimes that drove me crazy. There were parts in this book that made me cry, made me laugh and made me swoon.  Like I said every emotion was it with this story!

After thinking about it, I realized that I just did not care about the main character,Landry James because she doesn't care about anything but self gratification and sex. She is basically an amoral, bored housewife who doesn't love her husband, only the things he gives her, and seems to spend her days caring only for her grooming and looking for new sex partners. Even when she and her friend are threatened at a sex club, she's excited by it, not worried that her friend had a knife to the throat. In the end, she is recruited to be a sort of Mata Hari. She'll get paid by the government to have sex with men and get pillow talk information from them because she'd be doing it anyway, so she might as well do it for her country (and money). Landry did not appear to have any motives other than selfishness or to have any deep mental processes. I think I'll pass on her further ""sex agent"" adventures, I just don't care what happens to her.

First it had to do with the characters. These two had zero chemistry. They were so boring and blah together. It seemed like such a fake romance with such a fake story. I just did not like nor could I believe they could be a couple at all.

Secondly, the story. I liked the idea of the single mother saving the life of the star hockey player and falling in love but the story fell apart before it even begun. There was way too much thrown in to really stereotype the female lead. Anything awful seemed to to happen to her yet she was the strong single mom. As far as the romance these two hardly ever talked to each other but fell in love? I just couldn't get into it.

On ""Paris"" (11 tracks, 40 min.), Paris Hilton tries to portray herself as the new Britney Spears musically speaking. And why not? With Spears herself pretty muc having disappeared, maybe there is room in the market. Unfortunately, Hilton's singing is so weak and flat that no amount of producing can fix that. It took some wincing to actually listen to this album from start to finish. If I can point out any highlights, I guess it'd be the reggea-flavored ""Stars Are Blind"" and the dance-along ""Nothing In This World"", and surely it's not a coincidence that both those tracks were released as singles. The album closer with an absolute horrible cover of Rod Stewart's classic ""Do Ya Think I'm Sexy"".

I love Amazon's website and the idea of the cloud music storage system. Every time I use a horrible storefront website like Dell or bad software like itunes I appreciate Amazon more. However, I bet in a year from now Amazon is going to have a mess with this ""free"" year of 20GB turning into a $20/year bill.

On Lady Gaga and Born this Way: I really like the song ""You and I"".  This is not Madonna like. There is a Queen hook in there but it's not Queen like either.  I understand the comparisons to Madonna but I believe that Lady Gaga is a better musician. I love to hear Lady Gaga sit and play piano and sing. There is a lot of talent beyond her being a student of pop culture.

I do not think this idea of Lady Gaga encouraging acceptance of one's genuine self is a little thing.  I think there are obviously lots of young people who long to be accepted as they work to be different. It's a paradox. Ultimately Lady Gaga is a genius. You don't get this popular without a mad plan and a good brain.

Against their better judgment, Anne and Marco leave their infant daughter asleep next door while they attend a party at their neighbors. When they arrive home later that night, their baby is gone. What follows is a convoluted story about one familys secrets, lies and betrayals, with plenty of twists and turns to keep readers guessing.

The writing is rudimentary and theres basically no character development, allowing the story to move along quickly without requiring much of an investment from the reader. This is the kind of book I like to read on a Saturday night when I just feel like getting lost in a fun story for a few hours. Theres nothing truly outstanding or memorable about it, but it serves its purpose.

Im not really sure if all the twists and turns add up, and frankly, I don't really care. There were a couple of plot developments at the end that were notably unbelievable though, bringing my rating down from a 3.5 to a 3.

But then the story changes, becomes repetitious and the science was very farfetched. Now, I'm not saying farfetched is all bad. There are some very farfetched stories out there that have held my interest and that I've enjoyed. But in this case, the characters weren't very well developed and felt flat. The story felt like it was on a loop, giving us the same info, over and over.

And the ending was very abrupt. It felt like author Riddle decided he was going to write a set amount of pages and the book would end there, no matter what. 300 pages maybe?

Overall the book is ok. My main thing is there's lots of military explanations that I found boring, so I skipped through a lot; the second is the lack of character building. It's written almost as if an AI is giving a report of what occurs, not affecting anything about the characters into the mix. Very disappointing. The author definitely has a talent for writing but hopefully he'll learn to balance the immense tech download of information with what we really need to know in order to carry the storyline.

Wow! I really liked this book! I was apprehensive about reading it due to the synopsis but I am glad that I did.

I had to really stop and a take a look at myself and say really, really you are going to like him? But in the end I decided YEP I liked him! Will you?
The title of this book is so fitting this book is RAW and filled with emotion and has those what the hell moments in it along with the NOOOO moments as well.

268,"We all know what the term ""graphic novel"" means, right?  Well what do you call a comic book that's written in the form of a novel?  Especially if it contains a few too many subplots that bring it perilously close to putting it in the romance genre?

Ms. Wecker has the germ of a good fantasy novel; as a result, parts of ""The Golem and the Jinni"" are OK.  There's also a bit of OK historical fiction thrown in about the lower East Side of Manhattan in the late 19th/early 20th century.  However, the book is too much like a cartoon combined with a romance novel and seems padded to boot.  The characters, dialogue and plot are wooden and lifeless, and I finished it more out of a sense of duty and from any driving compulsion to find out what happened.  It's an easy enough read, so I'll give it three stars rather than the two that it probably deserves; on the other hand, when I finished it on a flight yesterday, I left it in the seat back in front of me rather than make the effort to carry this (heavy) book around with me any more.",1,"[-1.5118667643700354, 0.9614866257971979, -0.16593092974628132, -1.0442125704004617, -1.5851447979872]",0.9614866257971979

7717,"Coconut water is everywhere but I will start by naming the disgusting-tasting brands first: Happiness Inside, Jax Coco, Coco Samba, Vita Coco, Zico Coconut. Not only are these brands expensive, they taste hardly anything like coconut water. Even if they claim they just have coconut water, the fresh rehydrating and natural taste of coconut water is lost in some process or another and you are getting a really bad sugar-water !

In Canada, you can get Island King Coconut Water which is DIVINE!!! But you can't find it here so I might as well just get over it. In the US, I started testing every brand I could get my hands on. Harvest Bay Coconut Water came up as #1 most delicious tasting natural no-other-ingredients and LOW SUGAR coconut water. The low sugar is likely the indication that it is a YOUNG coconut and not an old one as they tend to sweeten with age. And the young coconut water is BEST for you.

I ordered the 12-pack from Amazon and while not cheap, it comes out better than the WholeFoods price and it is OH SO delicious and makes you want more and more!

How I drink it: Because of the high amount of potassium, you want to be careful how much coconut water you consume. I dilute it at a 4-1 (water-coconutwater) ratio so that I drink more water and my water tastes yummy. Sometimes though I just take a swig or two of just coconut water! :)

I am also very pleased with C2O Coconut water which I discovered to my delight at my local Harris Teeter and they are also low-sugar and very delicious. So in a pinch, both do!

HIGH Marks and a true 5-star for Harvest Bay Coconut Water!!!",1,"[0.4128722623740606, 0.9516865466561311, -1.057120104134059, -1.037234871132933, -0.9042129241055421]",0.9516865466561311

Ive enjoyed other novels by Kirkpatrick I love her earthy style of writing. Theres something so genuine about it. I can say that the same style exists in the pages of this one. But there was something about these characters, that after spending a third of this book with them, I just wasn't all that interested what happened to them. I wasn't relating to them at all. There also wasn't a lot of a plot happening. Perhaps if one of those two things were different, I would have finished the book. As it was, I eventually just sat it down, and never picked it back up again.

Perhaps this was one of those books that just wasn't for me. Or maybe it just wasn't what I was in the mood for. But either way, I just found it to be a bit slow and not what I was hoping for.

I was hoping this book would delve deeper into the characters but that didn't happen; it didn't even do a little bit of character enrichment for the new ones. There's also the issue of things occurring that we know shouldn't happen. I hate that when writers don't write the scenes the way they naturally would be but force them a certain way because they need it to be that way. This makes me mad. As readers we read these scenes and go, ""really??!! Are you kidding me?!!"" Idk... The story just seemed like it didn't progress very far, it was just kind of flat. Don't get me wrong their are some thrilling battle scenes but ""battle scenes does not a story make"". The last thing is just a thought but I don't get the title at all. I think it's referencing the prince but I'm not sure. I'm moving on to book 3 but only because it's on kindle unlimited; I don't think I would otherwise.

Kidd has once again exhibited her exceptional talent and extraordinary imagination by delivering yet another captivating paranormal romance. She never fails to entertain her readers. Every time I read one of her books, I always finish feeling completely satisfied with a large dose of the warm fuzzies in my heart. The story is exciting, original,  imaginative, fast paced, heartwarming, humorous,  romantic, arousing and sensual. The dialog is smart, well written and flows beautifully. The characters are fascinating, captivating, engaging, endearing and sexy. Beautiful curvy Erin Numm is only 28 but she's done with dating and relationships. Heck, it's been 18 months since her last date. Yep, she's done with men! Or so she thought! While shopping with her sister, Erin is approached by a mysterious stranger who introduces herself as Olivia Grey with Lovely and Kind Brides, a  mail order mates agency for shifters. Huh? And most surprising, she has the perfect match for Erin! What? Sexy lion shifter and rancher, Owen Brooks is a man on a mission. Well, two missions to be precise. Number one is finding a mate through Lovely and Kind Brides. It's been 8 long months and still no success. Nope, so far nothing - until Olivia Grey submitted Erin's photo and profile. He took one look at the lovely Erin and he knew she was the one. Now all he has to do is meet her,  convince her to move to Sunset Falls and become his mate. Now for number 2 - get Sunset Falls back in American Shifter Weekly magazine as one of the best small towns in the country for shifters, an award they won once in 1953. And all he has to do is convince his family and the townspeople to help and whip Sunset Falls and his pride back into shape. Easy peasey! Right? Not! Sexy shifters-check! Beautifully curvy bride-check! Humor, romance and a little good old fashion sex-check! This is not a serial. It is a complete book with no cliffhangers.

I'd had a jar of this tahini sitting in the pantry for almost a year without using it! (Shhhhhh!)
I finally decided to just dive in and try it.

The jar had separated into oil and ""paste"", so it took quite a bit of stirring to get it creamy again. But even after sitting so long, ignored, it tasyed really good.

We made baba ghanoush with this. We didn't entirely like the flavor, so we added a can of garbanzo beans to the recipe (which was mostly tahini, eggplant and lemon juice), blended until smooth, and it was very tasty!

Her life up until now has revolved around her work and her son.  She moved to Dare Valley to be closer to her brother so he could give her son the attention he needed from a man.

He has hired Jill Hale to help him convince the city council and others that this is a viable construction and back it.
Peggy McBride is totally against gambling of any type and sets out to investigate Mac and find something to help stop the resort.  She is determined not to like Mac at all.

9727,"I bought this for my cats several years ago.  I keep it stashed away on top of a shelf and bring it out every now and then.  I will say that it works, even after prolonged storage.  The batteries seem to have a long lifetime.  It's also fairly well-constructed, as my cats haven't yet been able to tear it apart.

All the pieces were in my package and assembly was quick and easy.  The feather bounced around as advertised.  I'm not sure how sturdy this is going to be for a large cat, since the supportive feet are a little bit flimsy and tend not to stay in place all that well.  It's also a little bit noisy, so you wouldn't want to leave it on for a long time if you were going to be in the room.

Unfortunately, my cats (I have four of them, with different personalities and toy preferences) aren't all that interested in this, although the youngest two (now 6 and 7) enjoyed it when they were under a year old.  So maybe it's better for kittens?  At least, that's been my experience.  (My cats do greatly enjoy a feather on a long stick, so it's not that they don't like feather toys or dangly toys.  Maybe they're not thrilled by the sound of the motor?)

With cat products, as always, your mileage may vary.  Cats are quite individual in their preferences and what works for one may not work for others.  Except for the supportive feet moving some, I felt like this was put together well, although it may best be suited for kittens or smaller cats.",2,"[-2.6993195443962295, -1.622227966937519, -1.1104669319739833, -1.003248102975098, -1.216536223836331]",-1.003248102975098

A vivid, engaging first book with strong characters, dramatic storytelling, which should establish Julie Kibler as a strong novelist. She most definitely possesses a gift of telling a tragic story, in an entertaining way with an inspiring takeaway of friendship and love. (She has just been added to my favorite author list, and so look forward to following this author)!

A complex and compelling portrait of the painful intricacies of love, loyalty, discrimination, and racial tensions. An insightful story of two women caught between their hearts, families, and their future.

Calling Me Home is no ordinary love story; however, a book of astonishing precision from past to present, from one younger black woman and an older white woman; raw, painful, beautiful feelings told in honesty, unfolding precisely and eloquently, during this long road trip between friends of two different eras and color.

The real magic of the book was the subject matter of two families (black/white) trying to survive in an era in which men and women found themselves bound by strict constraints, dictated by society and ignorance. A heart felt story and forbidden love of two people fighting for a life they so deserve  a fearless, heart wrenching story about the power of true love and friendship.

There was much depth and power to this relationship between Robert/Isabelle; a timeless love derailed by others, secrets, and an era which did not accept this sort of relationship between a man and woman. A complex tapestry of lives intertwined, a compassionate story of those who are destroyed by love by secrets and betrayal.

There is warmth and love, even with such painful subjects, as the bond these two women share, not bound by blood, but by a friendship which changes Dotties life and her future, is remarkable  a portrait of resilience told with clarity and painful precision, probing the dark history of Isabelles past with a few surprises readers will love before it ends, making you smile.

An emotionally charged, absorbing novel about friends, lovers, secrets, and families. Kiblers sensitive and gripping examination of a familys past is engaging from the beginning and gets better with every chapter, with unforgettable characters. Eloquently told and making it more special, the authors insight into the subject matter from her familys history. A powerful and memorable story you will not soon forget.

This story was a story about two people that once had a connection many years ago, but now find themselves on two very different sides of a camera.  Laine is the Shuttergirl, Michael is the star.  He is always finding himself on the other side of the paparazzi lens, but what happens when the stalker behind the trees becomes the stalked?  When two old friends, connect through a camera will old feelings spark?

Laine Cartwright didn't have a good life.  She grew up in foster care and always felt like she was the one on the outside and even now, she is the one still standing on the outside trying to look in while the shutter clicks.  Michael Greydon is a swoony, sexy, nice guy in a sea of Hollywood sharks and I really did fall for him.  How can you not?

Laine was only fifteen, Michael was eighteen when they met.  Now years later you get to see how each has grown.  A second chance love story set in Hollywood.  You get the glam, the flash and all that comes with being in Hollywood and under the spotlight.

1721,"I received this ebook free from the author in return for an honest review. The first third of the book was very slow while the author introduced the characters. The main character is Kate Seaver, who is present at her father's death from a gunshot wound. He emerged from a house with a gunshot wound in his chest and tells his daughter:""He shot me.""
She is dismayed when the police and coroner declare it a suicide and sets out to prove he was murdered by James Rayburn. The rest of the book shows how she finds out the truth and also how the civil war affects her and her family. The book starts in Nashville, Tennessee in 1860 and ends in 1862 after the Union army has captured Nashville.

The author did quite a bit of research into how people lived their lives during this period, using such words as ""sockdolager"" and ""snood"".
I found snood in the kindle dictionary but had to ask the author what sockdolager meant--a forceful blow.

There are some laugh out lines early on in the book when she is called to a wake and the corpse is still alive.

Maggie was the wholesome good girl who was drop dead gorgeous but had no clue. She had been hurt by any man she came on contact with. She stayed late at work and never complained.

Benjamin was a workaholic. He felt guilty for being out partying when his dad died. He felt that he had to make it up to his dead father by working and not doing anything in life that would bring him joy. His employees nicknamed him Beast. He had the hots for Maggie from her very first day on the job, but would never dream of acting on that impulse.

One day while staying late on a Friday night per their usual, everything changed. His mother walked in on an innocent dinner they were having and Maggie just happened to be on her knees under Benjamin's desk, picking up her fork. They were placed in a tough spot. Benjamin's mom was letting him have it about interoffice relationships when Maggie spoke up claiming to be his fiance to save both of their jobs. What will come of this fake engagement?

Charlie St. Cloud recovered from the auto wreck--in the car he'd 'borrowed,' brought back to life by paramedics. His younger brother, Sam, though, died. And Charlie finds himself unable to move on, living his life in the graveyard where he buried his brother. When beautiful sailor Tess Carroll shows up in his graveyard, confused by her recent accident and still grieving for her father's death, Charlie feels an attraction stronger than any he's experienced before. But he knows that he can't enter into a relationship. His promise to stay with Sam comforts Charlie, but it also limits him. Still, there is something about Tess that's important, and that Charlie needs to understand.
THE DEATH AND LIFE OF CHARLIE ST. CLOUD is about life, death, and moving on. Because Sam's death--and Charlie's promise--gave Charlie the gift of seeing spirits of the recently dead as they work their way to the future. But the gift and the promise hold both Sam and Charlie in a curious halfway world between life and the promise of an afterlife.

It really does not run too smoothly for them  all either. This book is about Khan and he does not want to find a mate as he has already bonded to a human called Bailey about five years ago. Khan had to leave with his brothers to fight in the war and Bailey thought he just left her. Khan had no choice but Bailey did not know that. They meet after they both sign up to a dating site. Bailey has a secret and Khan is about to find out that sometimes life gives you a second chance. Thank you to Kim Fox for the amazing review copy, I loved it.

This story goes into a bit more detail, in certain bits, than one would find in the original stories.  However, in most cases these ""interventions"" make for a more enjoyable read and explain some of the things left unsaid in the stories by DLS.
The detection portions are very good and indicate how forensic examination is really beginning to have a significant impact on crime solving.

4771,I voluntarily reviewed an ARC of this book. This book was a fun read. Cam and Smith meet the day before she is to start work undercover at Calloway Corp. They share a hot and steamy night together. The next day Cam shows up for work and is assigned as Smith's new assistant. She sees this as a blessing in that she can figure out what is going on with the company so that she can submit a story to the paper she actually works for. Its a curse because this is Smith the man she is very attracted to and can not let on that she is there to investigate what is going on with the funds that seem to be missing from the company books. They try to keep their relationship professional yet with Calloway Sr trying to push Smith and Cam together it is very hard to stay that way. Cam and Smith finally give into each other. Neither expect what they find out as to who is embezzling from the company. As well Smith is very upset when he discovers that Cam is working there under false pretenses. He has fallen for Cam. Can he see past that? will they get their HEA? Read this great book and find out.

1798,"This well written history of the end of the late Bronze Age civilizations is part of the Turning Points in Ancient History series, but it can be read and enjoyed on its own without difficulty.  Eric H. Cline is an active archaeologist as well as a professor at Georgetown, and more importantly he is also an excellent writer, able to tell some colorful and amusing anecdotes and sprinkle  humorous asides and observations throughout his scholarship.

In the twelfth century B.C. the eastern Mediterranean world was enjoying a prolonged period of international contact, with goods being traded over a wide area of thriving civilizations, from Mycenae and Crete to Egypt up through Anatolia and into much of the rest of what is now known as the Middle East.  There was plenty of conflict between competing empires, but even battles and long military campaigns increased cross cultural trade and other contacts.  Then, beginning roughly around the year 1177 BC, a series of calamities brought these early examples of globalization to a halt.  There were numerous earthquakes, the climate changed in the form of a prolonged drought, resulting in increased unrest and migrations which led to the invasions of the so-called Sea Peoples, wars over resources became bitterer and more prolonged, and the Eastern Mediterranean entered a Dark Age.  Eventually new civilization centers arose, with new trade products and routes, and the old order was replaced with one from which Western civilization eventually was to develop.

Cline's experience and knowledge of archaeology led him to include many fascinating stories of discoveries, like buried cities and sunken Bronze Age sailing ships, which added color to his narrative.  He does a masterly job of examining different scenarios and analyzing their strengths and weaknesses, in the end explaining that the late Bronze Age came to an end from a general systems collapse due to interconnections which had become overly complex and delicate, so that one small disruption (as in the ""butterfly effect"") could eventually lead to a cascading series of disasters.  This, as Cline points out several times, is particularly pertinent information today as we make our way through the aftermath of a prolonged financial crisis.",4,"[-2.715028094232167, -1.700948965119419, -1.0145167109263367, -1.0054039888748754, -2.0251373628476808]",-1.0054039888748754

Other than just random cutting of little pieces of paper haphazardly she has had no practice cutting along lines, but with the very first page in this book she had no trouble at all.  She wanted to skip to some pages in the back of the book that were a little harder, so we tried some that had corners and curves - she got a little frustrated in a few spots but over all did remarkably well with a little encouragement.

The book is fantastic - the beginning pages start with simple straight very thick lines for them to cut along, and then it progresses to lines with angles and curves and the lines become thinner as you go along further into the book, so they can improve even more.  There are lots of fun, colorful pages and things for them to cut out and play with or decorate.

After seeing how much she has enjoyed this book I think we'll be picking up some of the other Kumon workbooks soon, and see if we can improve her letters and numbers.

This film has virtually every film noir attribute: a femme fatale, plot twists, crime, mischief, suspense, lots of smoking, and shadowy cinematography. In this film, the film noir aura slowly builds- it even gets progressively darker in asthetic and feel, which is pretty neat. It's sort of like dimming the lights in a room. The acting is superb, as Greer and Mitchum have chemistry, and a young Kirk Douglas does a fine job. Jane Greer is the ultimate femme fatale, with beauty, charm, but a very dark and corrupt side to her.  Out of the Past is essential to your film noir collection.

Their interactions are antagonistic, heated, and dripping in sexual tension...when they are not doing their best to ignore each other. They are the powder keg in their friend group just waiting to explode.

Their past both ties them together and puts up barriers. She hides her emotions and strives to be perfect all the time. She longs for safety and security. He is quiet, brooding, witty, intelligent, and intimidating to most. He is dangerous...at least to her heart. They try hard to keep each other at a distance, but both long for more and keep that hidden at least from each other. He is closed off from her. She's scared of more rejection and guards her heart. Everyone knows they belong together, but they are both clueless.

They tease, taunt, and drive each other nuts. He makes her feel alive, but also scares her senseless. He is obsessed with keeping her safe, but hates that she feels indebted to him. Their communication skills need a lot of work. Most of the time they end up fighting, insulting, or walking away from the other.

Both hate showing vulnerability and losing control. But it just takes on moment of true closeness to open up the floodgates. Even when they begin to give into temptation, they still have a lot of issues to wade through. Their past, their hidden feelings, regrets misunderstandings, fears, and outside influences are challenging to them.

They are volatile in every way--sometimes good, sometimes bad, always intense and entertaining.

I loved Archer and Elle together. Even during their denial, they were friends who acted like enemies, but would be there for the other no matter what. But acting on their attraction is only part of the problem, and they still have issues to face for a chance at more. And nothing is ever easy with these two. I was glad to get both of their points of view in order to see what was really going on in their heads.

Their whole friend group is quirky and fun. They've all had more of a clue about Elle and Archer throughout the series as their sexual tension and feelings were a poorly kept secret.

Natalia Puccini and Aiden McCann have a history together filled with young love and broken hearts.  Aiden grew up with a less than ideal upbringing.  His mother died when he was extremely young and his father lost himself to the bottle.  With little to no guidance, young Aiden became a bad boy.  The only one who believed in Aiden was a young Natalia.  Natalia had the perfect, ideal family with loving and supportive parents.  She thought her future was bright with Aidens love and working in her parents bakery.  But the future she envisioned wasn't meant to be.

Aiden left Red River, breaking Natalias heart, swearing he would never return.  Ten years later, his fathers illness brings him back to face the bad memories of the past and the one woman he could never forget.  Now, he has eight weeks to capture the heart of the only woman hes ever loved.

The Rebels Return is classic Victoria James.  This is a sweet romance that pulls at your heartstrings and if you didn't believe in love, turns you into a believer.  Aiden and Natalia have to overcome trust issues and feelings of unworthiness to claim the love they deserve and have been searching for.  The characters in this book are incredible.  I love the way the townspeople rally around each of them, never truly pushing, but dropping little subtle hints.

406,"Settle for More by Fox New celebrity Megyn Kelly is her autobiography and an especially interesting recounting of her dealings with Donald Trump in the Fox News debates.

Megyn is a great role model for 20-30 years olds with her focus, hard work and persistence. She's not afraid to show her weaknesses and presents herself as a mature, thoughtful and fun loving individual.

It's interesting to read about her family relationships and dynamic. A little too much time spent oohing and aahing her children, but I suppose she can be forgiven this as a proud Mom.

Overall, an interesting book and an inspirational one.",3,"[-3.7014214456671377, -1.6355920924698022, -1.2506575652545702, -1.0243633400904264, -1.0063887193528047]",-1.0063887193528047
2199,"Flight of Fancy is the second book in The Daughters of Bainbridge House series of books by Laurie Alice Eakes. Cassanda Bainbridge is engaged to Geoffrey Giles, who ultimately becomes the Earl of Whittaker after the death of his brother. When Cassandra calls off her engagement due to an accident which causes her to have burns, she travels to the country where she focuses on her other love, ballooning. Even before her accident, she was more interested in reading about ballooning than doing the typical girl things, like sewing and attending a party. As could be imagined, her ex-fiancee Geoffrey would rather her keep her feet on the ground in order to stay safe.

Cassandra and Geoffrey were both characters I liked, although I think I liked Geoffrey more than the heroine. He really cared for Cassanda regardless of the scarring she experienced due to her accident. He was also a great boss with an interest in doing what was best for the factory workers. I read the first book in this series, but even if I had not read the book, I would have been able to follow the story of Cassandra and Geoffrey.

This is an awesome story full of secrecy, mystery and drama which starts at the beginning of the story until the very end. This story is about Michael Valente and Nikki Pastore and their history with an organized crime family. Michael was grieving about his father's horrible death who was a second in command of Victor Pastore crime family. He sacrificed his life to protect Victor and all that Mikey has was his mother. Now his mother has just died in a road accident, and this tragedy adds to his already broken heart. Victor Pastore, the crime boss enters into his life with an attempt to help him but with a price. After returning to New York to bury his mother, he see his childhood friend Nikki Pastore. Nikki the heroine and daughter of the mafia boss had a lives a fairly good life. The characters in this book are amazingly written, and the chemistry between Mikey and Nikki was unusual and unpredictable even if Victor is a selfish prick....The characters are very believable especially in their situations and their reactions to things as they are revealed.

MY THOUGHTS

I always enjoy Valerie Bowman stories. This one is no exception. Novellas or full lenghth novels she has never disappointed this reader.

This one is a novella and still has enough depth that it is truly enjoyable. Be prepared to finish it in one sitting. The characters are as usual, well developed. It does help to have read at least part of the previous books in this series as there are repeat characters involved.

I give this sweet, sexy novella a 4.75 stars!!

Billy (Jamie Bell) has recently lost his mother, and his family are struggling to survive, it is 1984 and the miners in Yorkshire are struggling against the disintegration of their way of life as a result of Margaret Thatcher's callous closure of British coal mines without providing any alternative livelihood or compensation for those dependent on the industry. Billy's father (Gary Lewis) and brother (Jamie Draven) are strongly involved in the miner's strike and the future of the family and community looks bleak. Billy's father scrapes together money to send him to boxing classes, but he doesn't enjoy them and being captivated by the girl's ballet dances he transfers to the latter, while concealing this from his family.
But his dance teacher, the abrasive but big hearted Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Walters) notices Billy's talent and is determined he should be enrolled in the Royal School of Ballet in London. The resistance of Billy's father breaks down when he see's Billy's incredible talent and he will do anything to get Billy to be able to follow his passion and have a chance at a better life
Together with a few gems like 'This England' this is one of the few movies to focus on Britain's ever neglected and abused white working class, betrayed first by Margaret Thatcher and then by the liberal and left middle class elit, on account of Third world immigrants and Muslims, Britain's white working class have been abused and kicked around by both conservatives and the left. Scenes of poverty, such as the little blond girl with her rag doll, who stands outside the council houses, add a gritty reality to a wonderful, heartwarming, inspiring and passionate movie. Notable scenes include the clash between Mrs Wilkinson and Billy's brother tony, when Billy runs away and shakes his body in angst and rage to the tune of 'A Town like Malice'. One of the best movies of 2000 and accompanied by a really powerful soundtrack, this is a highly recommended movie to watch again and again.",4,"[-1.7032952446875746, -1.7198181897655744, -1.1718147514064872, -1.0070616849828944, -1.23478001822253]",-1.0070616849828944
6016,"Gia Mirabelli is a temporary resident of the Hamptoms and an author struggling for inspiration. When she meets Rush it is definitely not love at first sight. He is handsome, but also rude, controlling, and intimidating. But she is not scared of him so throws just enough sass and challenge his way to peak his interest. Thus begins the often changing dynamics between these two.

They make each other crazy in so many ways and it is fun to watch...from stand offs, flirty and witty banter, companionship, sexual tension, fear, unresolved feelings, to taking a risk. They push, challenge, and scare the crap out of each other. It's a roller coaster of need, jealousy, resistance, fear, avoidance, boundaries, confusion, and resignation that they can't keep going on the way they are.

They already seem like opposites and come from two different worlds and financial circumstances. But they also look at the future differently. She is the romantic who wants the fairy tale. He is the more cynical one that usually does not get close enough to have a relationship. He has kept himself guarded and has some deep rooted fears. They are a hot mess, but I actually loved them together.

These two characters could be so much fun but frustrating too. Rush really grew on me as he started out as an a**, but turned awesome. He had a lot of his own baggage to deal with, but he also had a good heart and protective instincts. And Gia could see past his hard exterior and push him. I loved their baby steps in trying to figure out how to make themselves happy and deal with what was going on in their lives. Although their forward momentum was often set back due to circumstances, and their lives seemed to be getting more and more complicated.

This is part one of a duet so I knew going in that there was bound to be some heart stopping moment at the end that would leave me wanting book two, Rebel Heart right away. And there was...but I was prepared for it (and had figured it out), but it did not stop me from enjoying this one.

5227,"MURDER AT LOWRY HOUSE (Hazel Martin Mysteries Book 1) introduces another likable amateur female sleuth.  Hazel Martin is a widowed, wealthy, post-WWI British aristocrat, and a successful writer of popular mysteries.  She has a furry sidekick/confidant, her Siamese cat Dickens.  This cozy mystery is an enjoyable, fast read, even though the culprit is easily guessed early on.

In the novel, Hazel receives a note, handwritten on lavender paper, that summons her to a house party in celebration of her elderly friend Myrtle's upcoming eightieth birthday.  In the note, Myrtle confides that she fears one of her immediate family members is plotting to do her in.  Hazel is doubtful, but packs her bags and Dickens' things, and moves into Lowry House where she can investigate the circumstances of the possible recent attempts on Myrtle's life (sabotage of a garden path, a mixup of medications, a possible poisoning).

After yet another close call for Myrtle, Hazel is convinced that a killer is lurking.  Eventually, with some help from Dickens, Hazel figures out the murderer's motive and scheme, although she fails to thwart the planned murder.  After it occurs, it is investigated by Hazel's friend and prospective love interest, Detective Michael Gibson.

This is a well-written, if lightly plotted, cozy mystery.  There isn't much character development, but Hazel is memorable for her painstaking use of an assortment of classic fountain and dip pens (Parker, Waterman, etc.).  Author Leighann Dobbs really understands the cozy mystery genre, and has provided a pleasant, satisfying entertainment for cozy mystery fans.",3,"[-3.6555485380206845, -1.306595288832721, -1.034971921392576, -1.0078512414540315, -1.6185284707269272]",-1.0078512414540315

I was drawn to Erin and Tobias' story from the very beginning. They've have feelings for each other for a while, but while Tobias is ready to start something serious, he recognizes that Erin is a bit more apprehensive and that he has to proceed with caution.

Erin is trying to find herself again, she's been grieving her brother, who she lost on 9/11, getting back from that loss has been a tough road for her. Erin has lost all hope, but when Slim walks back into her life, little by little he starts healing her heart and bringing her back to life.

There's plenty of romance between Erin and Slim, but there's also a lot of humor provided by the rest of their friends, the gang from Gansett Island.

Marie's writing style invites the reader in right away making them one with the story. Although, like I mentioned before we get a glimpse to characters and their stories from previous books, I had no problem familiarizing myself with them.

They will all be favorites for me, because they're set in my birth place and home town of Seattle.  The stories seem so much more real when you can see the scenes in your mind.  But that is certainly no distraction from Jance's great writing abilities.  It's just an added attraction for me.  I really love the way her books are so smoothly written.  Everything is so clear and characters' feelings so easy to understand.  I almost never have to reread a passage to get the meaning, when written by Jance.

1209,"I picked up this novel just after finishing THE PANTHER by Nelson DeMille, a 625 page tome full of interesting detail but yet somewhat slow moving.  David Levien's newest book (273 pages) gave me the adrenaline rush provided by a well-informed author pitting an imperfect hero--my favorite kind--against a monster who has been on the loose for many years.  Providing us first person detail from the perspective of both of these combatants results in a moving chess game that showed them to both be experienced and very good at what each  have chosen as their life's work.

This is the first novel I've picked up written by David Levien and obviously not the first one in a series headlined by former detective Frank Behr.  Like many other former policemen, Frank is now scratching the outer perimeter of what he used to work in and is doing a fine job of not making much of a living.  Despite his previous failures, of which there must be quite a few, Frank dogs this case with a persistence not to be denied.  Once a suspect finally is identified, Frank Behr is faced with a choice on how to bring closure both to himself and to the families of those ruthlessly taken by this absolutely horrible killer.

Like several other serials that I seem to pick up midstream, I'll order the previous books in this series so that I can understand how the intricate character who is Frank Behr evolved into what he is in this novel.  If David Levien's  previous books are as good as this one, it will be a very enjoyable journey for me and anyone else who takes up the mantle.  This book is very graphic and violent.

Gabriel makes mistakes and they aren't always easy to forgive. Olivia needs to decide if she can handle the way his past formed his character. If she wants to keep working with Gabriel they have to find a way to deal with his issues. They don't have much time to form an agreement though, as Olivia finds a dead woman in her car, someone who recently disappeared. There's no initial connection between Olivia and the woman, why was the body left for her to find?

Olivia isn't safe, even not in Cainsville. There's something going on in the town she doesn't know the details of. She needs the information to discover the truth before it's too late. Someone is after her and again she doesn't get her questions answered. Will she and Gabriel be able to find out enough before it's too late? Will Olivia's romantic life be a benefit or a burden in this case, how can she keep herself away from harm when she doesn't know her enemy?

Visions is a great gripping story filled with action, omens and mystery. I loved reading about Olivia's adventures again. She and Gabriel are slowly forming a friendship, but their bond isn't an uncomplicated one. Gabriel doesn't always consult Olivia when he makes decisions that concern her and that isn't a good plan.

Cainsville is a fantastic creepy series filled with surprising twists and turns and plenty of dark and evil plotting.

I'm surprised by how quickly I got wrapped up in this story once I began. A tornado blows through town and shakes up the lives of a small group of friends and the aftermath of it. What really caught me off guard was the budding romance between loner West and cheerleader princess Jules after he saves her life during the storm that rocked their small community.

For me, this was a light and easy read given the heavy subject matter. Picking up the pieces after such a devastating event changes your world in the blink of an eye. Following Jules's account which hops back and forth between a therapy session as she talks to a camera about her feelings. The ensuing drama revolving around rebuilding their lives as Jules tries to figure out her feelings for West that seem to catch her by surprise. I loved their relationship and getting to witness the slow build of watching them come together. West and Jules had a sweet back-story that melted my heart, hoping they'd get to be together. Even though Jules had a boyfriend, it's apparent early on that he won't be much of a contender for her affections. And although West and Jules are sort of thrown together during a traumatic event rather quickly; it works in their favor.

There were a few plot holes, unanswered questions and continuity mistakes in this book that drove me nuts early on. Parts of the story that seemed to be heading in one direction were abruptly cut off with no explanation given and the story continued on as if it wasn't an issue. It might not be to other readers but it bugged me a little bit. Even so, I got lost in the romance between West and Jules so it didn't hinder me from continuing on anyway. For a first book in the series it was pretty dang good. The writing could have been a little stronger, as the tense seemed to jump between first person and third/narrative, but I'd still recommend it just the same. There isn't a cliffhanger with this story but it does seem to continue on with the main couple in the next book. That's usually something I hate, following the same couple into a second book, but I'm excited nonetheless. This was a great way to occupy an otherwise boring day with nothing to do!",2,"[-3.196245594169727, -1.1275426344973607, -1.0206405194683668, -1.0084373089102343, -1.1654592000433892]",-1.0084373089102343

259,"Almost fifty years ago, a group of kids woke to find themselves trapped together in a walled village. There were no adults - they would soon find that there was in fact no one over the age of seventeen - and with the exception of siblings, none of them knew one another. They'd assumed that some tragic event left them alone in their town and with no memories. From that point forward, they called their town Claysoot and did their best to make a life for themselves. One of the things they'd soon discover was the Heist, the disappearance of any male on his eighteenth birthday. A few brave souls would attempt to breach the wall over the years, but their charred remains were always discovered within days of their climb.

Gray and his brother Blaine have only ever known life in Claysoot. Gray has planned everything carefully, avoiding situations that will make his own Heist harder. When Blaine is taken, Gray makes a startling discovery, one that will force him to attempt what no one before him has been able to do - climb the wall and survive.

I'm on the fence about this one. It was a fun enough read, but nothing felt all that amazing or stand out about it. Instead, it was similar in a lot of ways to a variety of futuristic, dystopian releases of late, some of which have been more exciting and others that haven't.

3788,"I liked how this novel was split into two parts. The first section introduces the journey of Carly Smythe and Jase Steele. They live on separate coasts but meet one summer while Carly is visiting her family in Jersey. The second section is the meat of the story where everything happens. This is a story of opposites attracting but not necessarily meant to last.

Carly wasn't planning for a romance on her vacation to the east coast. She is innocent and inexperienced when it comes to relationships so she appears to be the typical good girl. Her participation in this smutty book club gives her plenty of insight on the possibilities that made me giggle. I appreciate the known references! Meeting Jase at the beach might be the first impulsive decision she has ever made but she cannot resist him.

Jase Steele is clearly a bad boy and not afraid to flaunt it. It is obvious he has secrets piled up but it takes a while for anything to be revealed. The more time he spends with Carly, the more this charming side of him emerges. He makes some super sweet gestures that made me realize he was just waiting for the right girl. Carly is very different from anyone he has ever met so he pulls out all the stops eventually.

Their interactions prove how naive she is and left me wondering what was going on. They meet up and have these strange discussions, which result in Carly stomping off back home. She keeps walking away from him but then going back. The whole set up seemed odd to me. I was hoping her character development improved as the novel went on. There was a ton of back and forth in this story that frustrated me. I felt the structure could use some grooming to improve the pacing, especially in the first half. About midway through, pieces began to fall into place and the storyline made more sense. I really wish Carly and Jase spent less time pushing each other away and more time happy together.

Overall, Jase was a good read. It has solid components that carry the story and keep it flowing. The strong areas were enough to keep me reading. Carly and Jase form a bond that was very special. What they must overcome is quite inspiring. I will definitely look into other books by this author.

Thank you Delilah Marvelle for pushing past the boundaries and taking your readers into a story that is unique, powerful, intense, emotional and a joy to read.  For most of us we do not associate pleasure and pain as going together.  Our hero Malcolm does.  Just a warning, the prologue is very graphic and parts obscene, but it is an intricate part of the story and explains why Malcolm feels the way he does. He believes that he cannot never have a normal life with a woman because he is afraid of losing control of his desires and hurting her with obesession with pain.  He keeps tight control over himself at all times and even though he has been tempted over the years, he is still a virgin.  Then he meets Leona the heroine when he rescues her from a group of ruffians who have confiscated all her belongings to pay a debt.  She is an unwed mother who is trying to support herself and her son in a world where she is considered unfit for any employment or way to improve her son's life.

1886,"Hag-Seed, Margaret Atwood's update of The Tempest gets off to a bumping start.  It is not so much challenging as it is slow to get out of the gate.  For the first half of the book her Prospero, Felix Phillips, (later Mr. Duke) is the rather unappealing and disagreeable head of a repertory company staging Shakespeare's masterpiece.  In a story thread that owes more to All About Eve than the Bard, Felix is undermined and undone by an assistant in some not very convincing circumstances that send his career into a death spiral and send him into a self-imposed exile.  Where do managing directors go when they lose their companies?  To jail of course, to nurture the unpolished gems found there and plumb the population's emotional depth.  Most irritatingly, the only irony here seems to be in the main character's name...Felix.

I can't imagine any fan of Shakespeare or Ms. Atwood finding pleasure in the first half of the book and one might, as I did, cringe at the setting for the second half of Hag-Seed.  To do so is to underestimate the author's imaginative powers which are on full display throughout the rest of the story.  It is here that Hag-Seed finally seems successfully anchored to The Tempest and unquestionably soars.  Felix (now incognito as Mr. Duke) works with inmates to uncover the pleasures, the challenges and the joys of language that unfold for the players and for the reader.  It is really a stunning accomplishment, and I strongly suggest high schools across America lift a few of her Shakespearean ""raps"" when introducing the Bard to recalcitrant 16 year olds. Equally delightful are the discussions among ""players"" sparked by Mr. Duke as they sort through the author's intent and its meaning for them.

That the author redeems a very unpromising beginning so terrifically makes her more than a bit of a magician, too.  Atwood's Hag-Seed is an always welcome reminder of the magical power art has to enliven and enrich us all.  If it requires patience, remember dear reader, patience is a virtue.",3,"[-2.5263559408262566, -1.2676016991304093, -1.009045812798698, -1.04444004976862, -1.0189729120798534]",-1.009045812798698

Inspired by the life of a 19th century woman rice planter, CAROLINA GOLD continues Dorothy Loves winning tradition of weaving together mystery, romance, and rich historical detail, bringing to life the story of one young womans struggle to restore her ruined world.(Goodreads)

 My Review
Dorothy Love is a great author. I love her previous book Every Perfect Gift. This book takes on a new idea and feel in South Carolina. I thought this book would be even more fun to read now since we visited this area this spring. I love the historical facts and how Dorothy paints the picture of how the south was after the Civil War-pretty much in ruins. The characters struggle, Charlotte reminds me a lot of Scarlett from Gone With the Wind. Really it's the same idea from the second half of the movie, Charlotte gets things done and tries to continue rice farming and maintain her father's house. The author got this book idea from a real person, Elizabeth Pringle.

While I love most of the aspects and setting for this story, it was extremely difficult for me to enjoy reading Charlotte's character. She is not my favorite character and I felt like there wasn't enough depth for me to really find out who she was. I do love the setting and the minor characters are wonderful. I know many others will enjoy this historical fiction but the romance and lead character did not hold my grasp.

Connor left the foster home and was offered a better chance at life, while Jaxxon was stuck there and had to try and protect herself.  She had a tough time until she was 22 working in a bar and a man from a modeling agency gave her an opportunity of a lifetime.  Through all this, Jaxxon stayed true to herself.  She didn't take BS and didn't become someone she wasn't.  What I didn't care for was that if Connor had not seen her picture on a magazine, he would not have given her a second thought.  It's been eight years since they have seen each other.  Besides the first year he was gone, he never thought about her again.  He is crazy possessive.  Words like Hulk, red haze, the flip of a switch describes his rage when someone wants what's his.  He basically lies to himself through the whole book, saying he just wants a casual affair nothing permanent but his actions defies his words.",3,"[-2.397354987476713, -1.1465168382433435, -1.0996553117423526, -1.0090613228995566, -1.4821403047723822]",-1.0090613228995566

Damian, Earl of Windermere who we have met in the previous books has foolishly gambled away his inheritance from his mother, and if that isn't bad enough he lost it to one of his best friends who then lost it that same night.  The next day he wakes up and vows never to gamble again and turns his back on his best friend Julian Fortescue, who he blames for his troubles.  To regain his mother's estate he must marry the neice of the man who now owns it.  He marries her and then leaves for a year long diplomatic post in Persia.  He returns a year later to find that his provincial cit wife has turned into a beauty and is rumored to be having an affair with his former best friend Julian, now the Duke of Denford.  Cynthia does not know her husband and is not about to just resume their marriage because he says so.  Damian does not believe her when she tells him she is not having an affair with Julian, she says they are just friends.  There are alot of misunderstandings and misconceptions between them that they cannot seem to get past.  He is a diplomat who hides his feelings well and she is afraid that he only wants her because she is his possesion.  They wind up stranded together in an Inn in a snowstorm where they actually start to learn about his other and how the lives they have lead up to this point has shaped them into the people they are.  The interaction between Damian and Cynthia  is intense,  I love the way that she stands up to him and makes him realize how bad he treated her.  Miranda's prose and style are one of the best in the genre today.  She also can write some pretty steamy love scenes.  This book was very good and had a very satisfying ending.

Just $0.99 for the ebook short story, it represents a link between the first and second books in the series and does a great job of giving the reader a flavor for the storyline and plot.

When he was a young reporter, back in the late 60s, Arthur Crane exposed the secrets behind the cult murderer known as the Orchid Killer. And now in the present day Crane wakes to find an orchid on his pillow, the signature of the murderer, and triggers some strong memories within him, opening up links to his estranged brother.

Family, joy, death and sadness; Blood Brothers has it all in a short story set in San Francisco that takes the reader on a wild ride both into the past and present and across the streets of the iconic city. Whether you're a Rollins, Cantrell or Order of the Sanguines fan, or just want to give this story a try, you're in for a real treat.

For those who have read other anti-Hilary books, or who read the columns of many leading conservatives in the media, most of this will seem repetitive.  And I think there's still a good book - and a more balanced one - waiting to be written about Ms Clinton.

As with most of these books, your political viewpoint will undoubtedly affect your enjoyment of the book.  The left won't want to hear any of the valid criticisms, a fact that's already been proven by all the one-star reviews on here by people who probably haven't even read the dust jacket, much less the book itself.  If you lean towards the right, or if you're just a Hilary-hater in general, you'll likely enjoy reading about her supposed evil, scheming ways.

Klein's writing is good, even if some of what he writes seems unbelievable.  He tends to reach at times, but without that reaching this book wouldn't have generated such controversry.  This is just another average entry in a crowded field of books about political leaders, one not much better or worse than most of what is already out there.",2,"[-1.7622997524579633, -1.1305522649990627, -1.0605495231256703, -1.0097303904874357, -1.348495066569153]",-1.0097303904874357

The Amish Nanny is about Ada, the sister Lexie in Amish Midwife never knew she had.  Ada was sheltered with so many secrets her family kept that Ada was pretty much kept at home and backward. Her poor health played a part in this as well, as her Amish family didn't trust ""Englisch"" medicine, so she never got the treatment she could have (until her new-found sister Lexie was able to help).
When Lexie came to their town to find out who she really was, and who her family really was, She and Ada found out they were sisters and this changed Ada from a quiet shy unhealthy girl to someone more sure of herself.
She's given an opportunity to travel as a nanny and locate the birth mother she never knew she had until recently. The woman she called mother all her life, and was kept a secret, was actually her aunt.

Besides the arranged marriage, there are the health problems experienced by the couple, the deaf daughter's emotional problems, and a hint of the supernatural, too.  I liked the characters and felt for the situation they found themselves in, but both of them got on my nerves a bit for some choices they made and for not explaining things.  I liked the romance, but I would have liked more to it, more interaction or moments that would show their growing feelings.  Instead, it felt a bit abrupt to me.  I found Hannah very interesting and wished the supernatural aspect had been developed more.  Overall, I liked the story and will look for more from this author.

A Witchs Tale: Stuff & Things and What Boredom Brings by Rue Volley is a cute Young Adult (YA) coming of age novel. It is clearly the first in a series. There isn't a huge cliffhanger, however, the story is ended at a clear beginning for the young town folk of Ravenswood. This first Witchs Tale book is a good set up for the series with a balance of setting and character development along with sufficient action and plot tension.

Alexis mother died a while ago, but her dad, Christopher, has diligently raised her. Christopher is a cool dad; he is watchful and involved without being overly controlling. He has adequately covered both parents roles. It is not clear how much Christopher knows of his wifes secrets and has chosen not to share with Alexi versus how unaware he is of his deceased wifes real identity and talents. Some of the ladies in town are particularly interested in the widower; they give off a slightly creepy vibe that that made this reader ponder their role in the overall situation in Ravenswood and with Alexi in particular. Lovable Logan and mysterious newcomer, Kyle, are potential suitors to Alexi, and they provide much of the angst and underlying sense of dread.

A Witchs Tale is delightful in its creative premise and unique blend of characters. The story has the right amount of rich details to paint the scene, and the pace of the story moves along at just the speed. The story isn't rushed and it isn't mired in so much detail that there is no plot. This YA paranormal series is perfect for fans of the Blue Bloods series. Im looking forward to the continuation of this series.

Please, please, please read Savage Collision (Book 1) first. This is one of those series that you really want to read in order. Also, please note that in my first review I said Savage was my new book boyfriend, well Ive moved on. Gabe Anderson is now my book boyfriend (Sorry Savage).

Skye Hawke has had some tragedy in her life and has worked like the dickens to overcome and move on. Its not easy and everyone looks at her just a little differently. Skye is a grown woman who still has some bratty tendencies. She is a professional in the work place and is still trying to find her new place in her family. Her new reality is a little hard for her to take sometimes because of guilt and part of her soul being missing.

Gabe understands about soul connections because he and her brother Savage have a similar connection. Herein lies the problem. Skye is Gabes best friends little sister. Ruh roh - you see where this is going, right? Gabe served several tours of duty, suffers from PTSD as well as a few other issues and tries really hard to work on himself and move on in his life. He knows right from wrong and struggles with decisions.

I was so excited to read this book. I just knew there was a story behind Gabe and what makes him tick. I was not disappointed in even one page of this story.

The book starts off with Amanda's life as she grew up in a dysfunctional family, in rural Alberta without a lot of money.
To keep herself sane Amanda would buy National Geographic magazines, from the thrift stores and daydream of taking trips to the wonderful places she would see, and read about.
Once she moved away from home and went to Calgary, where she found a job that would make her good money and afford her to travel, she would do so, until she needed to go home and save up some more. She first started in the Americas and then India, the Near East and Middle East, until deciding to go to Somalia in Africa. On one of these trips she met an aspiring photojournalist,  Nigel, with whom she fell in love, yet years later as just friends she calls and asks him if he wants to join her in Somalia to do a story and take photos, he agrees and they meet in Kenya, excited about their journey, until the fateful day that they were kidnapped by an extremist group, who wanted money.
It is amazing what the mind and body can endure when one has the will to live. You will see what they do to try and make their lives a bit better, and their copping mechanisms.

A paragraph or two between them about their pasts would have been sufficient and it would have made a huge difference to me when she becomes jealous and why he is protective of her if the other knew the history. Otherwise a great start, great plot, great characters and I cant wait for the next one.

Once upon a time there was civilization. Something called ""The Damn Stupid"" happened and that civilization was destroyed. What people that remain revert to a technological level of hunting and subsistence farming. The weather changed also, producing something called a Thunderhead, a sort of tornado. But that is just background.
This is a coming of age story, set in post-apocalyptic North America. Elka lives in BeeCee or BC, what we would know as British Columbia. She lives alone with a man she calls Trapper, who found her lost in the woods. He teaches her everything she knows, warping her perceptions along the way. The story is her journey away from Trapper's worldview toward one where she can be her best self.

1469,"The Fifth Assassin is a follow-on to The Inner Circle. Beecher, the archivist is back for another round. In this case, someone is authentically recreating past presidential assassinations in excruciating detail that only someone like Beecher could appreciate. Beecher's suspicions move from person to person, all the while he's lining up in the cross-hairs of the President still gunning for him from before. The plot is fast moving and reveals quite a bit about Beecher's early life in Sagamore, Wisconsin. At the same time, there are numerous plot twists with some very surprising revelations. Beecher's loyalty to the Culper Ring is tested as more of their workings are revealed. All the main characters from before are back and some of the dead don't stay dead. While the ending provides closure for this particular assassin, it's clear that this is a longer story arc and will require at least one more installment for the final denouement between Beecher and the President.

As far as reading enjoyment goes, the book is well crafted, with good pacing, and much dramatic tension throughout. At he same time, the negative aspects are prominent. There are simply too many coincidental circumstances throughout. Sagamore is too tiny a town to have so many people end up in DC, especially with Federal jobs. It's also strange that three dads from that town ended up in the military on the same secret project. While the motivation for the assassin may have had merit, the ritualistic attention to flawless recreation of past assassinations made no sense whatsoever. Beecher cast as a suspect also made little sense. At the same time, Nico's role appeared integral, but without actual substance. Finally, while historical elements are welcome, judicious use is warranted. In this case, the presidential assassinations, playing cards, and secret societies just overwhelmed the present day story.

Hopefully in the finale, Beecher can achieve some degree of closure without the need for another series of bizarre killings, Presidential overreach, and a military cover-up.

When the opportunity presents itself to her she jumps at the chance to accompany 15 year old Louise Brooks to New York City where Louise will be attending dance school.

This book follows the history of what is known about Louise Brooks and her family closely.  It explores the 1920's and the prevalent attitudes of the time examining Prohibition, the Ku Klux Klan and sexual mores.  We find that Cora carries as many secrets as young Louise does.  Louise with her outspoken behavior challenges Cora and forces her to reexamine her life and her beliefs.  We discover Cora's hidden secrets and the reason she so readily came to New York City.

After Cora is transformed by the city we follow her life quietly as she move from one age to the next.

It's impossible for Holt to look away from the Amazing Arden. Only hours later, Holt arrives on the scene to see evidence that the magician's husband has been murdered and his body shoved in the same box she had used earlier for her trick. Arden is the number one suspect.

It is only by chance that Holt is able to capture Arden and he holds her prisoner in the small jail until he can turn her over to the other authorities. Arden has only the night to tell her story and convince Holt that she is innocent of the murder of her husband.

With magic and illusion, The Magician's Lie by Greer Macallister captured my attention from the first page.

Arden is a fascinating character who is adept at survival and self-promotion. Her story is compelling and filled with danger, intrigue, passion and love. Carefully plotted, Arden's story is beguiling and like Holt, the reader is never sure what to believe and what not to believe.

Because I was fully in love with the world created in The Magician's Lie, I was sad to see it end. With that love, I would have liked better development of some of the supporting characters. Because of the narrative style, Arden is telling her story to Holt. I would have loved to be more immersed in her world and the people she associated with on the circuit.

Macallister is at her best writing about the gruesome fire that destroyed the Iroquois Theater in Chicago. Arming herself with history, Macallister uses this as a critical point in Arden's story while bringing the reader right into the horrifying disaster. Placing historical figures at moments in Arden's life, including the relationship between Arden and the very real female magician Adelaide Herrmann also gives the story strength and credibility. The historical time period works perfectly for Adren's tale.

I was entranced by The Magician's Lie. It is beautiful, thrilling, dangerous and compelling. Talented and gifted, the Amazing Arden has a magic that is equally enthralling and horrible. It was hard to put it down and I wanted almost immediately to read it again.

8060,"FADE INTO YOU (Fade Series #1) by Kate Dawes

FADE INTO YOU is the first novella (July 2012 release) in Kate Dawes three-part novella series featuring Olivia Rowland as the Midwestern girl who heads to Los Angeles to work for a Hollywood talent agent.  Following in the same vein as many of the serial storylines similar to EL James, Beth Kery and Lisa Renee Jones, Kate Dawes has released this trilogy over a period of a few months.  Fade Into You introduces Olivia and Max Dalton, Hollywood's youngest and brightest movie director/producer/writer.

Olivia's decision to move to California was two-fold.  Following graduation from college, Olivia found a position working for local talent agent Kevin Anderson and moved in with her sister's friend Krystal from back home.  But Olivia was also trying to place distance between Ohio and the past. Hoping that Los Angeles was far enough from Ohio, Olivia embarked on a new career and a new life.  And Olivia did not expect to find herself falling head over heals for anyone, let alone Hollywood's bad boy leading director Max Dalton. When their promising new client was signed by Max for his latest film, Olivia had no idea the position she was about to undertake.

Max Dalton has had his share of women-any woman.  But Max, as successful as his is, was missing something, missing a connection with the trail of women who seemingly throw themselves at his feet where ever he goes. And Max was surprised when he spotted Olivia Rowland, the assistant to talent agent Kevin Anderson, in Vegas.  Without a thought, Max decided that Olivia was someone he wanted to get to know.  But life had a way of interrupting and it wasn't until he was back in LA did Max find Olivia, once again, and this time, he made sure that they would not be interrupted again. But it was Max's quick dismissal shortly after their first night together that would have Olivia regretting her decision about Max.

Like many novellas, the sexual relationship is quick to develop, but we do learn that there is some history and a past to each of our leading characters.  And it is Olivia's past that we will encounter first when he arrives at her doorstep uninvited.

FADE INTO YOU is a promising storyline with potential.  Like many of the books and series written in the same style, our leading characters are hiding painful pasts and secrets that they are tying to escape.",3,"[-2.9176071293412233, -1.052544978688073, -1.1068028178247056, -1.0117746982235367, -1.0214588798095565]",-1.0117746982235367
3420,"Three events of great importance occurred in Spain in 1492. First, the armies of Ferdinand and Isabella conquered Granada and flushed the Muslims from Europe. Then the monarchs signed the Edict of Expulsion, intended to rid Spain of its Jews. And finally, a band of intrepid men set sail with Columbus to seek a new trade route to the orient.

Its against this background of events Zelvin has set her entertaining and historically accurate Diego Mendoza stories.

All of the men with Columbus had reason for trepidation, though it was tempered with hope of riches and honors. Mendoza has additional reason for worryhes a Jew, a fact known only to Columbus. Though Jews had been toleratedeven respectedin the past, they were now the target of the Inquisition. Even those who had converted to Christianity found themselves at risk of torture, exile or even death.

The author told the events of the first voyage in two previously published short stories. Voyages of Strangers begins on Dec. 24, 1492 when the Santa Maria wrecked on shoals on the coast of Hispaniola.

Leaving a small garrison behind, Columbus and the main body (including Diego) return to Spain where the navigator is honored and begins preparations for the second voyage. While assisting in that process, Diego is also feverishly attempting to smuggle his teenaged sister Rachel out of Spain and reunited with their parents in Italy.

Rachel, a headstrong and intelligent girl, has ideas of her own. After some hairy episodes in Spain, Diego is just breathing a sigh of relief when he discovers shes smuggled herself aboard his ship disguised as a boy. Columbus agrees to take her on as a scribe, thus keeping her safe as they once again cross the Atlantic. Theres some evidence Columbus came from a family of Conversos, Jews who converted, though he was in practice a devout Christian. Rather than rely on that speculation, Zelvin has him protect Diego and Rachel out of the goodness of his heart and because he was friends with their father.

As the Spaniards (and Columbus) become corrupted by the lust for wealth and power, Diego and Rachel find love among the native Taino, whose lot becomes as tenuous as that of the Jews at home, and find their own lives again in jeopardy.

An admirable work of fiction. I hope Zelvin will treat us to more of the adventures of Diego and Rachel in future.",4,"[-3.2569297668769233, -1.6917512832952688, -1.0117813394871726, -1.0279402522826935, -1.2170945898904466]",-1.0117813394871726

Jameson is a born wolf and a strong member of the Feral Breed MC. A year earlier he found his mate lying among the dead bodies at a massacre and has dreamed of her and grieved her loss ever since.
Aoife is an archer, necromancer and deadtalker who helps spirits transition into the afterlife. Overcome by the sheer number of new spirits, she was in a trance between worlds when Jameson found her and thought she was dead. She has dreamed of him every night since then, believing him to be a fantasy.  But when she and Percy, a childhood friend and foreteller, travel to a lighthouse near Merriweather Fields to help witches under attack, she sees a man she thought existed only in her mind.

They are polar opposites - Whiskey is outgoing, a daredevil,  and Charlie is much more introspective - and envious of Whiskey's ease in traveling through life.

They haven't talked for years and all of a sudden Whiskey is in a terrible accident and lies in a coma. And Charlie hopes he will be able to make amends for the past.

Anyone who has been in the middle of family conflicts will relate to this story. It explores the many feelings that Whiskey's accident brought out - in Charlie, in Whiskey's wife, in their mother and more.

Charlie is not an easy character to like but he is an interesting one. There are a lot of emotional highs and lows in the story and the middle part of the book dragged - and then the ending seemed rushed.

Brad and Julia are engaged and she has one stipulation. She wants to be a fianc for a full year before walking down the aisle. Julia just wants to make sure Brad can truly handle being in a committed relationship. But, that doesn't mean they won't still bring other people into their bedroom. The only thing I couldn't understand was how, being an alpha male, Brad could sit back and watch another man pleasure Julia. It was definitely different, but so entertaining.

""You know, I will never need anything more than you.""

I love the transformation that Brad made throughout the series. He went from a total man-whore that wanted nothing more than sex, to a man completely and utterly in love. Not having had much love in his life, Julia rocked his world and made him realize what he was missing. The way the wedding ended up working out was perfect. I really wanted something small and more meaningful for them.

Jeff Guinn in his book The Last Gunfight, the Real Story of the Shootout at the O.K. Corral--and How it Changed the American West  attempts to sort myth and fact. Guinn who has done meticulous research while writing this book, is not about to let the Earp myth blind him.  In fact he goes to the other extreme and portrays Earp as a man of many faults.

Guinn does indeed build a background which explains the development of the American West, the personalities involved and the peculiar region and politics of Cochise County, Arizona where Tombstone was located.  I am grateful for his ability to provide me with this information, however with all the background information, the road to the gunfight is exceedingly long with Chapter 13, titled The Gunfight beginning on page 205.

As clearly and carefully that Guinn developed the background to the gunfight, one would expect him to utilize the same precision in explaining how the west was changed by this gunfight.  Sadly this did not happen and to me it seems as if it could easily be dropped from the title.

So many series place character drama over plot development, and some of this series has done just that, but not so in this installment. Those of you looking for soul mate angst and Quinn drama will be sorely disappointed. Those of you, like me, who love a good plot, an exciting storyline, and a detailed mystery, will love this. The series, and this book, do have one shortcoming though. Riley seems to bounce back and forth from wanting to be only committed to Quinn to wanted to jump any good looking male in the vicinity. While I was a tad irritated with this at first, I'm used to it now, and I don't expect anything less from her. I think Riley is one of the most unique heroines that I've read in any genre. She cares about what goes on around her, she thinks about the consequences before doing anything, and feels very guilty when she messes up. It would be one thing for her to blame her wolf and not be concerned with her infidelity, but that's not the case. She is complex, and she is not perfect. Her raging hormones were once a source of irritation, but now I feel they just add to her depth. I can't wait for the ninth installment in this series, even if it is mostly character based. I've grown to love every character in this series, and I applaud Keri Arthur's ability to create such an engrossing mystery with such fully realized characters. Bound to Shadows will definitely get your blood pumping. It's full of action, mystery, suspense, and of course a large dose of steaminess.

Tom has emotional and physical scars from growing up gay, but he doesn't let them stop him from engaging full tilt in life and romance when it comes along. He also has a fascinating psychic talent (for finding things and people) that immerses him in an interesting murder mystery.

His romantic interest comes with a huge package (sorry, couldn't resist) of guilt and resentment attached. The two spend a great deal of the book bickering, but considering their background it's understandable.

First of all, the couple is strong and deeply motivated. They have machinations of their own and they collide full front. Ryan is a criminal, he runs a lab and plans to put his chemistry knowledge as well as his devious mind to very good use against the mafia empire in the city. On the other hand, Sarine is an undercover cop who is in charge of bringing down whoever the drug F king is.

That's a hell of a conundrum, especially when they fall in love. I relished reading this story because of many aspects. The writing is strong and it shows both characters' minds as the fully developed people they are. They have understandable reasons for their actions, both the criminal acts and the betrayal. I felt for both of them.

Then, the romance and the suspense plot really combine to the letter. While they embark on this forbidden romance full of lust, longing and truly exhilarating intimate scenes, there is this other side of drugs, violence, thugs, Machiavellian plans and smart plotting.

Ryan is a lovable bad boy. He's tough but also cares for his family. And he's as sensually provocative as he needs to be. The first time he and Sarine are together, and the scene at that original restaurant are absolutely unforgettable!

The final part is pure adrenaline. It blows the mind with all that violence, shattered dreams, truth exposed and fated commitment. I was very sad with some of the events going on, and the last page felt harsh and abrupt, yet it's also impressive, very impressive. This series is amazing.

4185,"From the moment I read the synopsis of I Am Alive I knew I wanted to read it  dystopian society, ranking scales and a game where teenagers fight for their lives? Its like a mash up of every dystopian book that Ive ever enjoyed, with a bit of romance thrown in for good measure. And I Am Alive certainly didn't disappoint.

Decca definitely has some secrets, and in the course of the book more and more of them emerge as she fights for her life in a society where you are judged on your potential to be a good person in a variety of ways. I really liked her toughness but also her vulnerability, especially when it comes to the people she cares about. Coupled with a great sarcastic sense of humour and an ability to quickly adapt to the situation she finds herself in, she was a great character to ride along with.

The pace of I Am Alive is pretty much full-throttle the whole way through and right from the first page I was intrigued to find out exactly what would happen, and as more of the world was revealed I was more and more hooked in the story. Along with some very imaginative plot lines (genetically modified tigers anyone?!), the action scenes were a great mixture of tension and intensity.

I found the world-building both fun and fascinating and fully appreciated the authors ability to be both serious and a little bit clich at the same time. Along with the plot itself being a well-done mixture of dystopian key elements, there are also some fun takes on pop culture and history that I found almost amusing as well as being relevant to the story.

There were a couple of moments that I was confused by what was happening, and the characters are not completely developed (although this is understandable for a first book in a series) and one section where the editing needed a little bit of work, but overall I really enjoyed this fast-paced dystopian with some fun elements thrown in. The ending in particular really stuck with me, so much so that I dreamed I was in that world myself the night after finishing the book.",2,"[-2.547762131826357, -2.009151289258886, -1.0572127499693973, -1.013901000737558, -1.2325509455599455]",-1.013901000737558

Oliver finds himself longing for Schuyler. He knows that she's gone possibly forever and yet...he's in so much pain. He can't get her out of his head. Then he meets Freya. She might have the power to break the bond between Oliver and Schuyler.

Allegra doesn't feel right after what happened in Florence. At the moment, Charles is her twin brother. In this world, a twin brother with a crush on you doesn't fit in. Allegra cares for Charles, but she feels no longer worthy of his love. Instead, out of guilt and anger she pushes him away. Matters don't improve when she starts spending time with Ben.

Schuyler and Jack have been waiting for their bonding - waiting for the time when they will truly belong to each other. Schuyler wants everything to be perfect. She searches for the right dress to make the occasion perfect. There's one thing missing from her big day: her friends. Jack goes to great lengths to reach out to her friends in hopes they will join the couple. But Schuyler's great wish could also be her downfall.

1885,"I was so overjoyed when I finally had a chance to sit down and actually read, ""Paris for One,"" by the author, JoJo Moyes. Mostly, my excitement was from reading yet another novel by one of my favorite authors and yet I do have to confess that the rush of happiness lingered more when I found out this novel contained short stories. I adore short stories and I wish that authors would write more short stories than what is currently being published in the industry.

  ""Paris for One,"" is a group of short stories written by Moyes that is centered mostly around Paris, love and of course women who are learning lessons in both romance and in life. As a nice little treat, there is enough a short story entitled, ""The Christmas List,"" that is a truly an engaging holiday read.

  My favorite story of the book is also the first one, ""Paris for One,"" as I felt like Nell was a heroine that I could most relate to. She and her boyfriend were supposed to take this magical tour of Paris when he ends up standing her up and therefore misses the train.  During the time that Nell is in Paris, she has a lot of obstacles to overcome including to having to share her rented hotel room. I really loved how determined Nell was to discover Paris for herself and by doing so she learns more about who she is than she has ever before. Overall I just loved this story.

 The rest of the collection of short stories are worth applauding as well. Each story contains their own unique characters, mostly women that are having their inner-struggles regarding romance.  I would without a doubt recommend this collection of short stories!",3,"[-2.2512860071576193, -1.3100749485442087, -1.0918430167730442, -1.0328439243125374, -1.0139825605142276]",-1.0139825605142276
2148,"The Creole Princess by Beth White is the second book in the Gulf Coast Chronicles, and it kept me as entertained as the first book. While this book focuses on the same family as the first book, the series takes place many years later with later generations of the same family during the Revolutionary War. Although history was always my favorite subject, I don't remember learning about this time in history and the British, French, and Spanish people living in the Gulf area.

Lyse Lanier is a young Creole girl living at the Gulf Coast with a father who spends a large majority of his time drinking after the death of his first wife. Lyse soon meets Don Rafael Maria Gonzales de Rippardi, who is a well-known merchant, but is he really who everyone thinks he is? I really liked reading about their growing relationship, even though I wasn't the biggest fan of Dan Rafael at the beginning of the book due to his seemingly cocky nature. I ended up really liking the two of them together by the end of the book.

I think this is a great book for anyone who is interested in history, and there are a lot of different facts that are included in this series. Although you don't need to read the first book in the series to follow what is happening in The Creole Princess, I am glad I read the first book so I was familiar with the Lanier family history when they mentioned it in the book.

Last read this aged 13, when I loved it. Re-reading it forty years later, I still find it a jolly good read.
Set in foggy Victorian London, the novel opens with a married couple - the Buntings, previously servants and now reduced to a state of penury as they fail to find lodgers for their spare rooms. And then comes a knock at the door and their problems seem answered, with the arrival of prospective tenant Mr Sleuth - a gentleman, no less, who pays in advance and likes to read the Bible.
But in the first few pages we realise Mr Sleuth is somewhat peculiar: a man who does experiments in his rooms and demands to be left alone. And why does he go out late at night into the foggy streets?
Meanwhile London is suffering a series of Jack-the-Ripper type attacks on young women of alcoholic persuasion...

I have to put a disclaimer on this review by saying that I am not a Johnny Depp fan and am really getting sick of him playing the same role over and over. Having said that this movie is deceiving. The preview made it seem like it was a comedy, while there are funny parts this is not really a straight comedy. I never saw the TV show so I wasn't sure what to expect but to me the movie had the feel of less funny ""Death Becomes Her"" as far as comedy goes. To me the best parts were the old maid who doesn't speak at all and the soundtrack (as well as Alice Cooper). There were some pretty funny lines and Depp did do a good job but this is his typical character lately so I can't really be impressed by his acting. I will admit though that if you are a Johnny Depp fan then you will probably really enjoy this movie and totally disagree with my review. As far as my feelings I thought it was a little slow moving and seemed confused as to whether it wanted to be funny or not.

He has this formal way of speaking that just amped the hotness vibe. Man oh man, he is delicious. He is also determined that Ava is not going to get away from him. Shes broken their engagement but hes just not getting the message. I enjoyed reading the different ways she tried to get rid of the ring and how it kept showing back up.

The Harlequin feel dies down as the story deepens and we are shown Ava and Mateos pasts and what has led up to present day. Sometimes back flashes can be confusing but this author was clear with each transition and I never felt lost with the timeline. I was so anxious to find out what had transpired to bring this couple who apparently had it all to the crossroad where they now stood.

I was totally into this story and when finished immediately started checking to see if I had other books by this author. I mean come on, if Mateo is just one of her alphas, I cant imagine what all the others will be like.

At only 102 pages, almost qualifying as a ""novella."" Though the action and suspense is fast and furious throughout the book, as is typical of Morgan thrillers, the majority of it is ""old hat"" for books of this type and genre. Very little seemed particularly original. The biggest problem I personally had with this read is the utter stupidity and unrealistic behavior & decisions made by the character that is his daughter Alex. Other than that, the rest of the characters, plot and book make for an engaging, entertaining, fast-paced read.",3,"[-3.579758261435651, -1.7464179409174263, -1.0596746467555396, -1.0158538388957383, -1.0462636248301935]",-1.0158538388957383

This novella was just what I needed to get my fix of the Mayson men and women.  We get to see how Novembers dad, Mike is coping with single life and what the others are up too.

Mike has been living a single happy life until a chance encounter with an old high school friend, Kathleen.  It has been years since they have seen each other but when she moved back to town to raise her teenage son; Mike decided that they will be seeing more of each other.

As their relationship mostly consists of a night here and there, Kathleen wants more.  She is not getting any younger.  When faced with the decision, Mike realizes that he wants to have a life with Kathleen and her son Brandon.  He will be the father figure that Brandon needs in his life as his own father has started a new life.

They all continue to grow closer and soon you realize that everyone deserve a second chance.  Not only do we get a big surprise in the story but we get a glimpse into what the Mayson men are up too.

Set in Seattle in dual time periods, 1909 and 1962, Ernest is raffled off at the age of twelve at the 1909 Seattle World's Fair and goes to live and work in a high class brothel. He is treated well there and becomes friends with Maisie, the daughter of the brothel's Madame Flora, and Fahn, a scullery maid at the brothel. In 1962, Ernest, through the coaxing of his journalist daughter, tells her his story of how he arrived in America, his time living in the brothel, and meeting Gracie there, his wife who is suffering from dementia. This is a heartbreaking but beautiful story that is masterfully written by Jamie Ford. I highly recommend it.

This was an intense read. I hadn't read the first book in the series (although I will go and do that now). Avery, Parker and the other parts of the investigation team as they come together to solve the mysterious disappearance of Avery's friend Skylar have some great moments. This book deals with that mystery, and also Avery and Parker's past relationship that rekindles as they spend more time together trying to solve Skylar's disappearance.  The first few chapters were a bit confusing for me, not having read the other book in this series, I had a hard time when it flipped to the other characters on the team, but enjoyed the other moments as the team unearthed and dug for connections and clues with the crime scenes and the suspects in the case.  So much tension and lots of unexpected moments.  Faith did play a big part in this story, the main characters in particular prayed when worried or hoping for a conclusion to the mystery.  For me that was a plus, it helped the characters center their emotions, and release some of the tension.  I look forward to reading about the other characters in this series.  Avery and Parker had some lovely moments that were touching and sweet as they got to know their deepest thoughts and feeling resurfaced for each other.

2249,"Short stories admittedly aren't my favorite thing to read. I often find they are anticlimactic or that they feel unfinished, and I cant help but have a difficult time pouring myself into a story that I know will end so quickly. But Adam Johnsons short story collection, Fortune Smiles, won the National Book Award, so I had a feeling I was in store for something special, and I was anything but disappointed.

The stories  distinctly melancholy, darkly funny, bleak and sometimes surreal  are thematically consistent: they're about lonely people facing extraordinary challenges.

In Nirvana, a mans wife has been stricken with Guillain-Barre syndrome, her entire body paralyzed for the past nine months. Struggling with his wifes illness and her threat of suicide, he develops a program that allows him to speak to the hologram of a recently deceased president, and takes solace in his new confidant.

In Hurricanes Anonymous, a directionless young father takes care of his son in post-Katrina New Orleans.

In Interesting Facts, the ghost of a woman who died of breast cancer visits her family and worries about her husband moving on.

In George Orwell Was a Friend of Mine, a former Stasi prison warden is in denial about the atrocities committed under his watch, and eerily attempts to justify and rationalize torture as a necessary part of a functioning society.

In Dark Meadows  perhaps one of the most harrowing and disturbing stories Ive ever read  a non-offending pedophile who himself was abused as a child helps the police track child pornography cases and finds himself looking after two neglected young girls in his neighborhood.

And finally, in Fortune Smiles, a man who defected from North Korea struggles to adapt to life in South Korea and dreams of returning to his home country.

The problem with many short story collections is that they are uneven. While some of the stories take hold of you, others are immediately forgettable. But with Fortune Smiles, almost every single story had me captivated  with the exception, perhaps, of Hurricanes Anonymous. If you enjoy short stories, don't miss this collection. And even if you typically dont, give it a try anyway.",4,"[-1.9228097004446223, -1.2765908003609536, -1.0809172771956364, -1.0164837872072114, -1.4031067828697177]",-1.0164837872072114

1155,"James Ellroy's taut, clipped phrases and lightning fast, head-spinning style is an acquired taste. When I first picked up L.A. Confidential, I hated it. His style just totally turned me off. After a few chapters, I was totally hooked. American Tabloid is more of the same...
  The book follows three men, Pete Bondurant, Ward Littell, and Kemper Boyd, through a maze of corruption, murder, and narcotics, eventually leading to the order to execute the President of the United States. I've always been interested in the conspiracy theories that surround the assassination of J.F.K., but I've never seen the Cuban/C.I.A./Mafia theory spelled out so thoroughly. The best way to describe reading this book is that it's like looking in a dirty toilet that's being flushed....All this filth is floating at the surface, and as it inexorably gets sucked down, it all mingles together before going down the pipes. The various fictional characters mingle with real-life figures such as J. Edgar Hoover, Jimmy Hoffa, L.B.J., John, Robert, and Joe Kennedy, and Fidel Castro, among others. Everyone in this book is crooked, and it's VERY entertaining watching Ellroy juggle dozens of different subplots and characters, heading them all in totally unexpected directions. A must-read for fans of hard-boiled crime epics.
  My only beef is the same one I had with L.A. Confidential: L.A. Confidential was the third book in a four book series, and American Tabloid is the follow-up to those books. I still haven't read the other L.A. books, so there were times in Tabloid that I felt that I had missed someting.

Val McDermid brings us face to face with some disturbing issues in her book A Place of Execution.  A child's disappearance is always unsettling and McDermid's novel about  young Allison Carter vanishing from the closed community of Scardale is most disturbing. McDermid's tale is one which brings to light questions of justice and vengeance as well as providing the reader with a quality mystery story
Chief Inspector George Bennett and Detective Sergeant Tommy Clough join forces in their search for the missing 13 year-old.  Both men are interesting characters who have an innate sense of justice and a strong desire for Allison to be returned to those she loves.  The residents of the hamlet of Scardale, where young Allison is from seem determined to put obstacles in the way of the detectives.  All residents are related to each other and seem to know each other's business, but when the need to be truthful and honest is so vital they seem to be less than forthcoming.  This in itself is a mystery, because Allison is a well loved and valued member of the community.  It is odd that Scardale would be so distrustful of strangers as to disrupt the investigation.
While this book is a stand alone the team of George Bennett and Tommy Clough are an intriguing pair.  Bennett a young and inexperienced detective is sincere and idealistic in his goals.  George has a sympathy for the victim which is appealing and honest.  Tommy Clough is a seasoned veteran who seems impossible to fool and as such is a valuable asset to  George in his search for the truth in Scardale.

The book debuts on June 28, so you can run out and get yourself a copy, which, by the way, I highly recommend you do if crime novels are your genre of choice.

Missing, Presumed by Susie Steiner is a story that begins with 24 year old graduate student, Edith Hind gone and there are possible signs of a struggle and traces of blood, which causes the situation to be treated as murder. Each chapter of the story is written from the perspective of one of the main characters, which allows readers to learn more of their lives and their personalities.. The front door is open and she seems to have vanished into thin air.  Edith's parents and boyfriend are frantic, and the police immediately realize that this is going to be a big deal due to the people involved in the possible crime.

Manon Bradshaw is a very compelling and devoted member of the Cambridgeshire police. Detective Sergeant Bradshaw is obsessed with her job to the detriment of her personal life. She's also a very fascinating woman who believes in smelling men so she can discern their good and bad points.  She's one of those women who ""puts out"" on the first date just to know if a second date is forthcoming.  Manon has ambivalence in most areas of her life and she is definitely far from perfect. While she wants to get involved, she's not a fan of most people which makes it hard. I think these characteristics make her more human and readers can connect with her as a character.

""Suspenseful and keenly observed, Missing, Presumed is a brilliantly twisting novel of how we seek connection, grant forgiveness, and reveal the truth about who we are.""

While this is a crime novel, it's also about every form of the word ""family"" - whether that's biological, marital or otherwise. More importantly, the story is about bonds, connections and ties between others. The story is tightly plotted and intensely addictive. The story has a slow moving - but very engaging - plot that is very realistic and believable.  Missing, Presumed is recommended for those readers who really enjoy literary mystery reading.

But he can also admit that he is a bit envious that his friends are finding their happy-ever-afters now when his never materialized. Their team is trying to take down a Russian syndicate that for several reasons has also become personal for them.

Amy Murray is an FBI agent who has a personal stake in trying to help find missing women.  She is highly intelligent, motivated, brave, caring, and understanding. She has been through several situations that have left their mark on her and shaped the woman she is now. She is determined to go undercover in a casino and use all of her skills to help infiltrate this crime ring.

And that means working with Eagle Securities and Cabe. When they are partnered up there is surprising sexual tension and attraction. The lonely man who has not been interested in anyone in years is having a hard time ignoring the pull. He is beginning to feel alive again, and he has a strong need to keep her safe. And the woman determined to stay away from impropriety at work is having just as hard a time avoiding it. Their plan is to try to stay professional at least until the op is over. But that will be challenged by adrenaline, fear, and his need to watch out for her. I really liked both of these two characters. They both had demons to deal with along with the job at hand, but were tenacious and could appreciate the other.

It's duty versus lust and love. Can he protect her yet still let her do the job she was trained for?

This has suspense, danger, steam, and emotion. There are plenty of layers built into the mission and the casino vibe gives it a different feel. It ties up the progressive story arc from the first two books and brings back the other couples Six and Lou, and Mac and Delaney.

  It is truly shocking to think that there are actually people still behaving as though we still have slavery and hating people of different races, cultures, religions, and sexual orientation.  It is also shocking that these racist people hate enough to hurt and kill to express their hatred.  Jodi did bring attention to issues that we are still dealing with and need desperately to end.

Before I Go To Sleep is S.J. Watson's first novel. I can't believe someone would take on such a theme for their first, being that the writing requires so much, but Mr. Watson did a great job! Before I Go To Sleep is about 47-year-old Cristine ""Crissy"" Lucas who suffered an accident in her twenties that caused severe retrograde and anterograde amnesia. ""Each morning, her husband has to tell her who she is, who he is, and so on. And each morning, after he leaves for work, she receives a phone call and is prompted by a doctor to retrieve her secret journal. There, she discovers increasingly frightening inconsistencies in the stories that her husband tells her--and in what the doctor says."" This psychological thriller is written in the first person from Cristine's perspective. I really liked this story. It was a bit slow for my taste but I think it had to do with the subject. Cristine has to start her life over every day, and the reader is reading her journal entries along with her and is basically just as confused as she is while she is trying to interpret her written experiences and distinguish what is true and who to trust.

This story is coming to the big screen in 2014 starring Nicole Kidman, Mark Strong, and Colin Firth.

2776,"I love having my own personal Christmas every day of the year!  Perhaps that comes from having limited resources available for presents when I was a child.  Or perhaps it's because I am an inveterate reader who looks at each new book as a present that you discover simply by opening the book cover.  Like Forrest Gump said ""Mama said that life was like a box of chocolates.  You never know what you're gonna get.""  And so it is with new books.

The Amazon Vine program has provided me with exposure to several new authors over the years, most of them pretty average as far as writing skills and telling a story.  On occasion a new star is discovered who immediately captivates you with his writing style, story-telling ability, and an imagination that provides a markedly different approach.  Such is the case with Spencer Kope's new novel ""Collecting The Dead"".  I noticed that Spencer has published a few earlier books that received little notoriety.  His new novel should dramatically change that perspective.

If you enjoy reading about imperfect heroes who are able to overcome their short-comings and put their unique talents to good use, you will enjoy ""Collecting The Dead"".  In a nutshell, this story is about Magnus (""call me Steps"") Craig, an FBI tracker who uses a special talent to locate and capture serial killers.  Unfortunately part of his job is to also locate the killer's victims and bring them back, dead or alive, to their families.  Hence the title of this novel.  As his unit members constantly remind themselves: ""we save the ones we can"".

Having not read any of Spencer Kope's previous works, I can't comment on how his writing skills have developed.  I can say however that he has now provided us with a fast-paced and engaging novel with an interesting new approach.  His story grabs you by the throat at the very beginning and then takes you on a dark thrill ride as you become embedded with his unit.  If you have ever visited Disney World and ridden on Magic Mountain, you will recognize the feeling of hurtling through the dark at breakneck speeds, not knowing what twists and turns lie ahead, only that things can get much worse before they get better.

Taught writing, black humor, witty banter, sarcastic comments, innocent victims, and dark monsters somehow inhabiting human form as they go about their dark and terrible deeds destroying human lives and rending families apart.  This novel will be a tough act to follow.",4,"[-1.9524512232574105, -1.4910628707679932, -1.0680213701779286, -1.0177203207772452, -1.0826367741309795]",-1.0177203207772452

A really enjoyable book, a bit short as i managed to read it in one day but Saxon and Tee relationship was fun to read about.

Saxon was Tee's best friends boyfriend until he cheated on her. Now Tee's best friend Lexi is finally one good terms with Saxon and is now seeing a guy named Ryder. Complicated part is Ryder and Saxon are both in the same band that has become really big and have been touring. Tee won't admit that she's attractive to Saxon and seems to still hate him for what he put her best friend through. Saxon wants Tee in a big way and vows to her that he will get her to trust him and break the friend barrier. It is hard with Saxon on the road touring has Tee has to trust him and believe that he does want her and won't cheat on her. It's a battle that gets put to the test on many occasions throughout the book.

I do wish that Saxon had to try a bit harder to get her as it seemed to not last long. I love the suspense of will they, won't they but it sort of didn't take long for her defenses to come down and for her to let him in. It was enjoyable to read and i am looking forward to reading more from Chantal Fernando.",3,"[-3.3056620878987477, -1.8515948708831231, -1.3649800827694585, -1.017975844219567, -1.1188964575443834]",-1.017975844219567

94,"The School of Good and Evil is an interesting book - what is essentially a riff on fairytales ends up being a straight adventure story lacking any of the morals upon which it is based; as such, it ends without making a point and contradicting itself and the characters throughout. Less demanding readers will read it as a simple tween romp and enjoy it as such. But more demanding readers may be frustrated by the lack of point of view by the author.

Story: Agatha and Sophie live in an isolated village in the middle of a forest. Every year, the 'headmaster' of the School for Good and Evil comes and takes two children in the night to be students in his school.  Sophie eagerly wants to go: she's sure she'll be a fairy tale princess.  Down to Earth Agatha, however, finds the whole thing pathetic. When both girls are taken to the school, Sophie ends up in the school for evil (to be a witch) and Agatha lands in the school for princesses. With both girls sure they are in the wrong place, how will they survive their schoolmates long enough to get back to their village?

Most of the book is a fish-out-of-water story of each girl dealing with the horrors of their situation: beautiful Sophie with the farting/warted/dowdy evils and grounded Agatha dealing with the vain and superficial princesses.  There should be a lot to mine here and a lot to be said about not falling into the cliches of either group. But somehow nothing is really said - is Sophie evil in her heart? Is Agatha really purely good despite her frogs and antisocial behavior? Are the princesses, with the callous and selfishness, really good? And are the evils really born that way or made so through cruel treatment?  The answer ends up muddled in each of those situations as the story mostly concerns Agatha trying to get home and Sophie stymieing her.  Even a point that neither is wholly good or wholly evil fails to materialize in this muddled plot.

In listening to this Audible version (in which the narrator did an excellent job), I kept feeling like there was going to be something deeper than the shallow story on top.

This novel does not come up to Jar City,  The Draining Lake, or Voices.  Its premise is interesting - the stabbing murder of Elias, a young half-Thai boy that might have been racially motivated.  As Detective Erlandur of the Reykjavik Police investigates this heinous act, he talks to Elias's schoolmates, teachers, neighbors and family.  There is plenty of racism and the case is complicated by other extraneous matters.  Included in the list of possible culprits is a pedophile who tries to lead Erlandur on a different trail, one that follows his own step-father who he calls a monster.

Erlandur is still reading his missing persons books, stories of people who disappeared into the Icelandic wilderness.  Never having overcome the death of his brother, Erlandur soothes himself by reading tales of the disappeared, some of whom have come to a better end than his brother who disappeared without leaving any trace.

Erlandur is also dealing with the impending death of Marion Briem, his mentor and first supervisor when he entered the police force.  As in previous novels of this series, Marion is sharp as a tack even on her deathbed and the reader never finds out Marion's gender.

This novel gives the reader great insight into the new Icelandic society as it deals with issues of multiculturalism and xenophobia, wanting to keep Iceland's heritage as it was and lily white.

I am not sure if all of his novels read this way or not, but for me, this read like watching one of the more recent Christian films being made (ex. Fireproof or Courageous).  I found it to be interesting and heartfelt, and had no difficulty zipping right through it.

Chapin, tackles some difficult and often over looked subject matter. In general, most romance novels are about couples dating, and on occasion you stumble into one where the couple is already married. I found this to be interesting, as it is written from a male's perspective and deals with the issues of a troubled marriage, floundering faith, forgiveness, restoration and a few other matters I won't list because I don't want to spoil it for you.

The characters are written realistically, their faults displayed but also their journey to mature and draw closer to God. Now, while I found all the sage advice to be true, some may find it a little too preachy or such. I think it will be a matter of opinion. Still, as I said, I raced through the story and enjoyed the journey.

825,"We all know what became of Anne Boleyn, the second wife of Henry VIII, but what about others in the court?  This novel gives readers a look at that viewpoint.

Margaret (aka Madge or ""Pretty Madge"") is fifteen years old when she comes to court to become a lady in waiting for her cousin, Anne Boleyn.  She lives there for three years and sees the king's affections toward her cousin Anne wax and wane.  She assists in the birth of Princess Elizabeth and two stillborn sons.  Madge becomes, at Anne's behest, involved in a scheme to help Anne keep the King's affections and keep him away from ""Plain Jane"" Seymour.  Warning:  Some things involved in this scheme -- things that Anne orders Madge to try -- are described in explicit detail, as are Henry's conjugal difficulties.

Readers see some of Madge's own problems, too, besides the court intrigue. Madge falls in love with one of the young men at court, but another man wants her and has royal approval to pursue and marry her.

Readers do see plenty of the historical figures -- Cardinal Wolsley, Thomas Cromwell, and many more -- and the religious turmoil of the times.

Barnhill creates a good story, but the strong sexuality at times keeps me from giving it a five rating as a warning to other readers.",3,"[-1.9233181842779836, -1.877912863706992, -1.0329773183876878, -1.0190640013358834, -1.4403841015985903]",-1.0190640013358834

New Beginnings
Others of Edenton 0.5

Having read (and fallen in love with) In Too Deep, I couldn't wait to start reading this book. Taking place 2 years before In Too Deep, this is the story of Jess and Slater. Firstly, how do I move to Edenton? It sounds too good to be true, with all the sexy hunks living there (Brody still holds my heart, but Slater is a close second now).

Every character has its place, and no matter how large or small their part in the story, none seem like background characters. There is a realistic aspect to the story, and reading about Jess' mistakes in her past and how she ended up in Edenton was well written (and will possibly remind you of parts of your own lives!) I have no idea how Jess deals with being a psychic, why would you do anything if you knew it was going to end badly? Despite this, she lives her life best she can, and won't let anything get in her way when she sets her sights on something. Slater is a strong alpha, and cares deeply about his entire pack, no matter how crazy or insane they seem. They both go through an emotional roller coaster of a ride, it would be boring if it went straight to happily ever after, but they finally realise what they could have if they both let it happen. Highly recommend this series to all paranormal romance lovers.

454,"At the core of this book is a great story about Harry Morgan.  Despite his racism and misogyny, he is, much like Hemingway himself, ultimately a sympathetic character.  We want him to succeed given the force of his will and the odds against him.  Also, despite his tough talk, and sometimes equally tough deeds, Morgan wants to do well for his family and wants to help out the dispossessed.

Unfortunately, Hemingway felt the need to write a novel rather than a short story, and the story suffers in the process.  He experiments with shifting points of view and interior monologues -- almost like he wants to show the world he can beat Joyce and Faulkner at their own game.  Worse still, he shifts the story away from Morgan to a collection of ""haves"" who are not sufficiently developed, believable, or sympathetic.  Again, one gets the sense that Hemingway is experimenting with another writer's style (in this case Fitzgerald), but does not quite bring it off.

The one passage I remember from reading the book over 30 years ago is the epiphany experienced by Morgan's wife when he sees Harry ride away -- capturing both the strength and the hopelessness of Harry's character.  This passage is one of the best Hemingway ever wrote.  It and the basic story of Morgan make the book worthwhile.

It is ironic that this book received so much criticism.  It is much better than the ""Old Man and the Sea"", for which Hemingway won awards.  The theme of individual's struggle against forces much larger than himself is much better told in this book than in Hemingway's later work.",3,"[-3.8769890062059726, -1.6089228838058847, -1.041000475582907, -1.0196663943331152, -1.3672875174885197]",-1.0196663943331152

I have been ready and reeling to get my grubby little hands on one of these books since hearing about the Wild Card, the first book in the North Ridge series. Unfortunately, I haven't read that book as of yet, but I totally will now that I have read this gem!
John ""Maverick"" Nelson is the head of North Ridge S&R team and he needs to hire a new member that is either a minority or a woman. So, he hires Riley Clarke, who is a new resident of British Columbia, Canada trying to start life anew. Unfortunately, there is an instant connection between the two that could make their working situation quite sticky with the no fraternization policy.
Riley is fun, outgoing, courageous, but she is still trying to overcome the aftermath of a past S&R mission gone wrong and losing a loved love. But she isn't looking for a relationship when the obvious connection between Maverick and herself makes itself known and grows through training, missions, and their time together.
Even though this is my first read from Karina Halle, I loved her use of dual POVs for Riley and Maverick, her detail in the S&R line of work made is so realistic, and the sensual encounters between these two... WOWZERS!

We've heard the stories about the legendary Daratrazanoff twins, Gabriel and Lucian. Gregori's older brothers were great fighters and protectors of the Carpathian people. Everyone has believed them dead for centuries, but they've really been locked beneath the earth all this time.

The brothers made a pact early on that should either one become a vampire, the remaining sibling would take his life. When Lucian began to show all the tell-tale signs that he had succumbed, Gabriel tried to keep his promise. The two clashed over and over again, with neither emerging the victor... until Gabriel tricked his brother and bound them together underground.

A disturbance awakens the twins in modern-day Paris. Shortly after rising to the surface, Gabriel meets Francesca, his lifemate. It turns out that she's lived hundreds of years without him... convinced he sacrificed their chance at happiness to be a guardian for his people. Now he must break through the walls she has built around herself and convince her that they are meant to live together as one.

Francesca isn't your average Carpathian heroine. For one, she's already Carpathian. Two, she herself is an ancient. She is powerful in her own ways, as well as resourceful and determined. She has suffered in Gabriel's absence all these years... but at the same time, so has Gabriel. He is, of course, a bossy, alpha, Carpathian male. But at least he values her mind and her gifts; he cares about her feelings; and feels real guilt for the way his actions have impacted her life.

I really enjoyed the twin dynamic between Gabriel and Lucien. Unlike Aidan and Julian, these two have a tangible connection. And the addition of young Skylar to the family, touches a real chord. Already, Feehan is laying the foundation for that one day love story between her and Dimitri... you know, the one I'll get to read before I collect Social Security... or maybe not.

I was pretty intrigued with the synopsis and I have to say the story kind of grabs you right from the first page. The concept, a company who uses girls with special powers to do their bidding, is pretty cool in itself, and I really liked how White laid it all out. What's even more, I was really drawn to the characters, especially Fia.

I think what I liked most about this was the relationship between Fia and Annie. From beginning to end, their love and loyalty to each other was incomparable. Yes, they had some selfish moments and their circumstances definitely put some strains on their relationship, but their bond was strong and I really appreciated that aspect of the book. Annie is basically the innocent, naive, ""weak"" one and I didn't really like her most of the time, but she has her moments. I think she became a stronger and more likable character as the story progresses, whereas I really liked Fia from the start. She's kind of wild and crazy, but after everything they put her through, it's understandable, and also, necessary. Fia is such a strong, determined, fierce female character and I loved being inside her head. Oh, there was one scene where Fia does something CRAZY in order to protect Annie that totally shocked me.

Oh, and that ending?! Brillant! I kind of saw it coming, but not until right before it happened. And I loved it!

The whole concept of this book - trying to find the girl who you wished you had the guts to approach in ""that way"" in high school to see if the spark is still there.

Enter Coop, very handsome and sexy ""cowboy"" and Julia a beautiful young lawyer.... when they were in High School, Julia thought Coop had a thing for her identical twin sister so her shock in receiving a mysterious invite to a Dude Ranch for a week took her by surprise. Her dilemma on whether to attend or not continued until she actually arrived at the Ranch.

The chemistry between Coop and Julia is swoon worthy. Both of them have grown into themselves over the last several years allowing them to explore the feelings they've had for each other all these years.

The setting of the Ranch is beautiful, tranquil and relaxing opening Julia's eyes to both Coop and what's possible in her life. And what she sees excites. Adding Coop into the deal and you can only imagine how hot and steamy these two will be together if they can manage to get out of their own way. The steaminess factor between our H/h is enough to fog up your windows!

Can Coop and Julia overcome what they perceive the other wants both from their partner and in their lives?

All of Dan Waslshs books are the type that you cant put down, and this book was no different. When Doug Anderson goes to college, he begins to fall away from his family and the faith that had been a part of his life growing up. Dougs friend Christina went through a similar situation in the past, and she is trying to help him leave behind the bad environment he got himself into.

I enjoyed reading about the Anderson family again, and Doug was a really interesting character to read about. Although I didn't face the same type of temptation he did when he went to college, I think it was interesting to read about the struggles some people face when leaving their families so I can better understand and empathize with them. Im sad to see this series end, and I would definitely recommend it to someone who is looking for a new book series to enjoy.

2988,"This was a fascinating story that I did not want to put down!  I loved the character of Erin, a follower of God but very attracted to Adam, an unbeliever.  She was strong and sassy and gave Adam a run for his money.  I liked Adam, too, but it was a little frustrating to see some of the choices he made, especially when he was felt he could run his own life better than God could.  Faith and the power of prayer were very important elements in the story and they were done very well.  I liked the discussions Erin and Adam would have about God and I especially liked Erin's struggle to be obedient, no matter the cost.  It was fascinating to learn about the Navajo culture and so sad to read about what many of them endured at the hands of the government, especially taking away their children to go to mission schools.  This fact was what led Erin there in the first place and I loved the sections that focused on the woman Erin's trying to track down.  I like stories with a mix of contemporary and historical elements.  I appreciated a look into a culture I'm not very familiar with and I'm glad to see more stories being published about Native Americans in the Christian market.  I really liked the other characters, too, and felt they added much to the story.  The romance was fun and their banter amusing.

Yes, Autumn takes place in Britain in the fall of 2016, exactly four months after the devastating June 23 referendum.  Elisabeth, an art historian, sits by the bedside of Daniel Gluck, the only man she has ever truly loved despite the 70 or so years' difference in their ages.  The narrative securely anchors the reader by providing the date and Elisabeth's age at the time, as it weaves in and out of her story.

Next, there is so much to chew on, not the least an introduction (at least to this reader) of Pauline Boty - the only female pop artist of the '60's, dying tragically young and leaving an astounding body of work which has for the most part disappeared.

The Duke of Griffin is a honorable and responsible Nobleman who looks after his twin sisters, his extended family and everyone and everything in his purview.  He was not always a responsible Duke.  When he was younger he caroused with his friends.  Wine, Woman, Gambling, reckless wagers and mischief. The wager that he and his friends made brought ruin and scandal to the young ladies that debuted that year.  He and his fellow Dukes have never been able to live down the wager.  Someone is spreading rumors that his twin sisters should suffer for what he did years ago.

Esmeralda Swift runs an employment agency for governesses.  She takes care of her younger sister and barely makes ends meet.  The Duke of Griffin walks into the agency and demands that she be his sisters chaperone for the coming season.  They are instantly attracted to each other. The sensual pull between them is intense. He has never been this obsessed with a woman before.  She is off limits because she is in his employ.

The connection that forms between Griffin and Esmeralda is wonderful and is the core of this story.  Amelia's writing is witty and charming.  I smiled throughout this book.  I loved Esmeralda's little sister Josephine and her dog Napoleon who will make you laugh out loud.  This is also a emotionally fulfilling love story that brought me to tears.

Hicks writes about the people and times of New Orleans in the late 1870s with great description. I got a sense of the pain and suffering that Hood must have gone through after the war. Hicks (the author) does a great job weaving the story together as the journals/ledgers from Hood and his family are read by someone Hood trusts and the reader begins to put the pieces together of Hood's life.

It's a bit long and historical fiction is not my favorite genre, but Hicks does a good job giving real substance to a Confederate General who tried to live a normal life after the tragic wounds that he suffered.

Victor struggles with Alcoholism after his time spent fighting in WWI and Nadine attempts to keep her family together as she tries to deal with the various familial relationships in her life. Their oldest and youngest daughters seem to be insulated from the problems their family is experiencing while Kate, their middle daughter, tries to help keep her family together.

In addition to Kate taking care of her family, she becomes the protector of Lorena Birdsong, a young girls who is abandoned by her family because they do not have the means to care for her. As Lorena's place in the small community is being questioned, Kate and her parents must face past relationships with their families. Nadine's father, a pastor in the community, does not feel as if Lorena should be raised by the Merritt family so he designs a plan to have her placed within another home. Victor's father, Preston Merritt, has never forgiven himself for the death of his other son, and he places that anger upon Victor.

Through the Merritt's attempts to return Lorena to their home, they begin to face what went wrong in their pasts and how they can rectify those situations. It's clear through the pages that the Merritt's have a strong relationship with God, and this relationship is what allows them to get through the difficult times in their lives and begin to forgive one another for past mistakes.

We gain insight into Isaac also as the event of his childhood where his father Abraham almost sacrificed him deeply affected his relationships with his mother and father and ultimately with Rebekah and their sons Jacob and Esau.  Ultimately, we come to understand how Rebekah could have deceived her husband in order for Jacob to get the blessing instead of Esau.

I really enjoyed the insight into Rebekah's life.  I came to understand her and Isaac's choices and how a person can get so focused on being right that it consumes them at the expense of others.

I like cozies as a break after some of the heavier books I read and this really fit that space nicely!  The author has a formula here that works well for me: a bit of the paranormal, but not too much; close family; pets that aid in the crime solving; setting in an Eastern coast vacation town. There are four sisters who really care for each other and each is unique in her ""paranormal"" gifts (although not all of them are developed yet in this book). Angie has inherited a Victorian mansion where her sister Ellie has set up a B&B.

As with most Americans of a certain age I have vivid memories of November 22, 1963 (I was six, by the way)and the terrible days that followed President Kennedy's assassination.  Before, during and now after  my career as a high school history teacher I frequently fantasized about a time machine, a  way to return to the past to observe and perhaps change pivotal events.  I've read a number of wonderful books about time travel, and I have to rate King's newest effort among the best of them.

Jake is a high school English teacher in Maine in 2011.  Essentially rootless and feeling adrift, he learns of and is deeply touched by stories of old tragedies affecting people he knows.  Then he meets Al, a man with a secret: access to 1958 through a wormhole or bubble.  He makes a few trips back into time, eventually making efforts to prevent some of the local tragedies with which he is familiar.  Then Al assigns him another task: return to 1958 and spend the next five years working to prevent JFK's assassination.  Jake accepts the challenge, but he finds unexpected twists and turns that complicate an already difficult job.

King's depictions of the modern world and that of the late 50s and early 60s are fascinating and colorful.  The suspense is never ending and immeasurably enhanced by the vast amount of research he undertook to ensure historical accuracy.

This is my first paranormal romance starring a werewolf. Logan Black is a former Marine and werewolf hired by his best friend, Jake, to protect human wedding planner Veronica Vale. Veronica is the younger sister of Leah, who is engaged to marry Jake.

Veronica has been receiving letters from a secret admirer who also happens to be a werewolf. She isn't a fan of werewolves. In fact, her sister was attacked by a werewolf about a year ago and is now a werewolf herself. Veronica loves her sister but she despises any other werewolf even though her sister is marrying one.

Logan's job is to protect Veronica from a distance but that doesn't work out so well. His attraction to her causes him to get much closer than he expected. Their relationship heats up and he doesn't get the opportunity to tell her that he is also a werewolf. Veronica's interactions with Logan and other pack members help to change her perspective regarding werewolves and she has to do some soul searching of her own. Ultimately, her journey becomes a lesson in love and the age old issues about judging a book by it's cover. I really enjoyed the book. It is part of a series but definitely stands alone.

2982,"The book is told in alternating timelines and I think it was necessary to fully grasp the story and Sophies journey in unraveling this mystery. Sharpe only highlights key points in Sophies life that are essential to the story and I appreciated how seamlessly she weaved both timelines into one cohesive read. A lot of times, I get irritated with alternating timelines because it just isn't done well, at least in my opinion, but Sharpe does a great job at this. I was kept engaged with these characters, especially Sophie, the whole time I was reading and I never felt bored or that any part of the story was meaningless.

There was a bit of a twist that I didn't expect right away from Sophie and Mina, but Sharpe leaves subtle clues throughout the book for you to pick up on and I liked the way it all played out. I really enjoyed being in Sophies head, getting to understand her inner struggles with finding out who Minas murderer is and battling with her addiction to pain killers. I really felt for Sophie, especially considering how everyone was against her, and internally praised her for fighting so hard for her friend. When the mystery finally reveals itself, it wasn't what I thought at all, and it kind of made me sad how things ended for Mina. The ending is far from happy, but it fit with this storyline and definitely leaves you feeling content.

Far From You is full of surprises and twists that will keep you glued to the pages wanting to know what happens next. I think readers of all kinds will enjoy this book, but especially those who love a good mystery. Sharpe tackles so many important and emotional topics in this book, it definitely surprised me with how well she executed most of it.

A you woman was tormented every day by a peer of hers. Now, years later, the meet again. This time, he has changed his name and appearance. But something about him is different.

Mercy has a difference that is visible to everyone's eyes. Her stump of a hand puts her on edge. She feels handicapped by it. When she was a girl, a boy made fun of her daily for her stump...yet she still survived. Now grown, Mercy is still struggling with her physical appearance. It went from a physical to an emotional handicap.

Aaron was a young boy who tormented others to make himself feel better. He knew what he was doing was wrong yet he still did it. His family life was awful and he thought others should not be happy if he wasn't. Now as a grown man, Aaron wants to apologize to all his peers and hope to make a difference in his students' lives. But Mercy might prevent that...and his past has a way of hindering him from his future happiness.

Together Mercy and Aaron have a long way to go. Both need to learn what is stopping them from being happy. Forgiveness is not just one sided. Each protagonist has suffered pain, loss, and trauma. But with some faith, friends, and new beginnings they might just find the peace they're looking for...

1331,"Betsy, Queen of the Vampires, is having a tough time. Her wedding is only three months away and she is unready. She's sure her friends are planning a surprise birthday party that she doesn't want--and hopes they will throw. When a visiting delegation of European vampires visit, it turns out that one of them was responsible for turning one of Betsy's vampire friends. What, exactly, is the penalty for a two-hundred year old murder? Especially if the victim is still around. Meanwhile, Betsy's friendly ghost keeps announcing that there's a zombie in the attic, Betsy's best friend is sick, and Betsy has decided to give up on sucking blood--causing all sorts of problems for her fiance/husband/king Eric Sinclair.

Author Mary Janice Davidson has followed Queen Betsy's progress through several novels now. The concept of a scatter-brained blonde becoming the Queen of the Vampires because she isn't subject to most vampire weaknesses is a strong one that generally creates interest. Romantic foil Eric Sinclair is tough enough to be sexy, yet completely fixated on satisfying Betsy's needs. That and he's a super-rich vampire--hard not to like that.

Davidson's breezy first-person narrative creates a strong flow, encouraging the reader to tackle just one more page, one more paragraph. Wide-spaced lines and plenty of white space ensure that even the most book-averse reader can make it through. Still, I was expecting more from this book. Generally, characters should change and grow in a novel. That really didn't happen here. Betsy's self-absorbtion is funny, but it does make her less sympathetic, and it became hard to really care about her problems--reducing the story conflict. I found the resolution to the problem of the European murderer unsatisfactory as it had nothing really to do with Betsy, and the whole zombie thing left me scratching my head trying to figure out what that was about and why I should care.

1224,"""Death. It doesn't have to be boring.""

Perhaps the above sentence, taken from the introduction to Mary Roach's ""Stiff"", is the best way to summarize this unusual book. While death has historically been a taboo subject - and still lends itself to a fair bit of squeamishness - it is no longer simply an end. After a person dies, his or her body can go through a variety of situations. Simply being buried is no longer the status quo, and in this bizarre yet informative look at the uses of human cadavers, Mary Roach explores what bodies have done - and can do - for us.

""Stiff"" is divided into twelve chapters, each dealing with a different ""use"" for the human body after an individual dies. Among the topics discussed are medicinal cannibalism, medical labs, bullet and bomb experiments, plane crashes, composting, body snatching, decapitation, organ transplantation, human crucifixion, and crash test dummies. Each chapter discusses not only how cadavers are currently used but also explores their past uses in that particular area, and it also seeks to explain why bodies are used in this manner.

While it may sound gruesome, it isn't. The book is full of interesting scientific information. For example, the damage done to the remains of plane crash victims can help explain what brought the aircraft down, and this science was used in the investigation of TWA Flight 800. Cadaver legs have been used to test footwear made for those who clear landmines, as they are about 1/10th the cost of artificial limbs. And there is a scientist in Sweden who is hoping to present the option of drying remains and turning them into compost as an eco-friendly alternative to cremation. These things are incredible, and while Roach has a definite sense of humor about many of the things she is writing, she never becomes disrespectful to the dead. It's obvious that she feels those who have donated their bodies have made a big impact on society.

""Stiff"" is a highly unusual book, but it's incredibly interesting. It's full of strangely hypnotic scientific facts, and there is no doubt it will be unlike anything you've read before!",4,"[-1.0280514987877085, -1.3202587897455098, -1.0339127473847265, -1.0236263386161637, -1.2056567213823424]",-1.0236263386161637

Holly becomes more dark and swallowed in misery while Sy starts to realize he needs and wants her. They have to slowly build to where they want to be and it definitely isn't a smooth ride but these two were made for each other and it was beautiful to watch unfold.

The story line in this book was fantastic. Everything flowed really well and was really easy to read. I loved the passion and emotion from Sy and Holly. Frankly, you might want to keep a fan handy because its hot! There is a lot going on with the club and the characters have a lot to overcome but they all come together and work through everything.

9139,"I enjoyed this book in the sense that it was about a horrifically abused woman who escaped her husband and subsequently found love again, even though she never thought that would happen.

Angel bore the scars on her body of her husband's wrath. Mentally beaten down to the point she felt ""less than"", she found her inner strong again when she realized she was pregnant and escaped with the help of her brother's MC. Determined to never ever be a victim again, Angel struggles to find who she is while learning how to defend herself with the club's SAA, Demon, a man that she had a one-nighter with not knowing who he was. Demon and Angel are drawn to one another, even as they both deal with the demons from their pasts.

As a survivor of DV (although not to the extent portrayed against Angel), I applaud the author for tackling such a tough subject. Not only did the female character's ""husband"" physically abuse and scar her, he mentally scarred her. Seeing a character grow and find love again was wonderful; I immediate one-clicked the second book in the series so I could finish the ""rest of the story"".",3,"[-1.6927065222330686, -1.9119666359967518, -1.2558058913462886, -1.0247753767413468, -1.0273818242679915]",-1.0247753767413468

Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau made a number of strong comedies together, and this one does not disappoint. Set as aging widower neighbors who haven't gotten along since they both loved the same girl in their youth (Lemmon's character Gustafson married her), the two feud, play pranks on each other, and exchange very funny barbed quips throughout the movie.

When widowed Ann-Margret (as beautiful as ever) moves in across the street, the old rivalry cooks up again. The irrepressibly vivacious woman puts some spice (or at least hopes of spice) back in their lives. Complicating matters are their kids. Matthau's son had a life long crush on Lemmon's daughter, and when she moves back in with Dad after separating from her husband, a second chance is at hand.

Burgess Meredith delights as Lemmon's father, in one of his last performances.

I really loved Josey and Will. They were both really quirky, and fun to read. You get invested in these two pretty quickly. Their relationship starts off very awkwardly. By the end, it blossoms into a tender and adorable romance.

Josey is very easy to like. Yes, obviously she has her own flaws, but overall she was an endearing character. She is a straight talker to the point of bluntness, socially awkward and funny. I found myself rooting for her, I adored her quirky personality.

Will is private, reserved and stoic, he also is considerate and sweet. Hes someone who puts others before him, and I loved that about him. His kindness, selflessness and generosity really made him an incredibly likeable hero. He is a famous athlete and the media is making him out to be a sexual deviant because he is into voyeurism. He needs a roommate to keep him on the straight and narrow, to keep him busy and distracted and it shows how lonely he is despite being a celebrity.

Without giving too much away I must say that I became totally enamored with these two and the time they spent together and the intimate moments they shared. They feel comfortable around one another.

It's been a long time since I read a Nero Wolfe by Rex Stout, but STOP THE PRESSES! fits right in with the Nero Wolfe series I watched fairly recently on A&E (starring Maury Chaykin as Nero Wolfe and Timothy Hutton as Archie Goodwin).

In this novel, a much-hated, much-read gossip columnist (modeled on Walter Winchell) informs his newspaper that he's been receiving seriously threatening telephone calls.  The columnist then supplies his editors (and Wolfe) with a short list of the five people who most want him dead.  Eventually the columnist's body is discovered--an apparent suicide, but with suspicious surrounding circumstances.  Naturally the newspaper's publisher and editors engage Wolfe to determine whether the death was murder or suicide.

Goodwin performs his usual magic in persuading the five ""suspects"" to show up at Wolfe's brownstone on successive evenings for private interviews.  Eventually Wolfe unravels the circumstances of the columnist's death, and then announces his conclusions at the customary gathering of suspects, clients, and police.

This is a short, fast, thoroughly enjoyable read for all Nero Wolfe fans.",4,"[-2.625584518266402, -1.7815865378403677, -1.0953615746093086, -1.0254109712503738, -1.0257322505536721]",-1.0254109712503738

239,"In the early 90's a group of high ranking officials from the Russian and American governments came together to form a highly classified initiative that could potentially lead to the death of millions of people. To ensure the security of the agreement, all involved parties sign a document that allows an international assassin to be ordered to eliminate anyone who leaks the information.

Fast forward to the present day, and the information has been stolen. With the threat of the horrific details of the plan being revealed, various entities begin to search for the documents, and the person who they believe could be responsible. Will Cochrane, an MI6 operative leads a team, in cooperation with the CIA, to attempt to find the man responsible for the missing papers. But the mission soon becomes far more personal. Someone has discovered Will's true identity, and threatens to release the information and to harm his sister, the only person on the earth who he truly cares about. The story quickly becomes an international tale of intrigue in which Will grapples with the implications of the released documents, faces the highly dangerous assassin, and attempts to discover the person or people who threaten to blow his cover.

The complexity of this novel makes it quite difficult to explain the plot without spoiling the twists and details that make it so compelling. Author Matthew Dunn is a former MI6 operative himself, so he brings a unique understanding of the inner workings of the secretive organizations that are explored in this book. This is the third novel to feature Will Cochrane, but the story itself stands alone as a completely realized narrative. It took me a bit of time to acclimate myself to all of the military jargon used throughout the novel, but the plot is intriguing enough that I was quickly able to work through it.

The character of Will Cochrane could have easily been a cold, one-dimensional man, especially given the secretive nature of his work. Where Dunn really excels is in extracting the emotions of this man who has essentially been trained to show none. It was fascinating to read about Will's internal battle of dealing with his inner feelings while never letting them betray the complex mission at hand. Overall, this is a fast paced, complex, international conspiracy novel that easily sets itself as a top example of the genre. Dunn is able to successfully combine his own personal experience as an MI6 operative with the conventions of modern thriller novels to create a unique and nearly flawless book.",3,"[-1.9387479288726828, -1.2611351730198013, -1.0810761495209973, -1.026176899684358, -1.1624176462363722]",-1.026176899684358

9329,"Who knew Owen Wilson could write?  I sure didn't, but then I stumbled upon the comedic masterpiece known as `The Royal Tenenbaums' and I was quickly put in my place.  With fantastic work by the entire cast, this film succeeds in becoming a smart, witty and deep comedy that far surpasses what passes today as a good laugh.

Gene Hackman does a brilliant job as Royal, prick-father to three genius yet dysfunctional children who decides he wants to make peace with his family and become the father he never was.  His children are splendidly played by Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson and Gwyneth Paltrow.

Stiller plays Chas, the athletic financier who buries himself in work to avoid confronting the death of his wife.  He's slowly becoming the father he always hated to his two sons yet he won't accept that and thus refuses to accept his fathers attempt to reconcile.  Wilson plays Richie, the tennis star who hit a slump after his adopted sister Margot marries Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray) and thus becomes somewhat of a hermit.  Paltrow plays Margot, the playwright who's estranged from her family and quite the downer.  Together with their mother Etheline (Anjelica Huston) they make up one of the most eccentric families the screen has ever seen, but they are certainly one of the most entertaining.

Along with his sidekick Pagoda (the hilarious Kumar Pallana), Royal tries his hardest to reach his families hearts, albeit going about it in all the wrong ways, but he must contend with Henry Sherman (Danny Glover), Etheline's fianc, who is determined to make his efforts fail.  With brilliant performances by the entire cast (Hackman, Paltrow and Stiller stealing most of the show) and a hilarious car crash scene involving family friend Eli Cash (Owen Wilson) that had me reeling, `The Royal Tenenbaums' is a unique comedy that is sure to please and be remembered for time to come.  There aren't many comedies like this one, and that makes it all the more special.",4,"[-4.26310339178887, -2.366143969748648, -1.122135716391164, -1.0276249205508043, -1.2521130122192308]",-1.0276249205508043
785,"As a dedicated fan of MC Beaton, I loved Deadly Dance.  Agatha shrewdly moves into creating her own detective agency and manages to turn a profit in spite of herself.

As always, readers have fun reuniting with the cast of characters -- the vicar's wife, the town policeman, the cats and more -- and watching Agatha Raisin in action. I love having a middle-aged heroine who combines acute business sense with a misguided view of human nature. She's so real and Beaton manages to convey complex emotion in a light-hearted Cotswold romp -- not an easy feat.

The plot seemed a little more twisted this time and I had trouble accepting Agatha's flirtation with someone who's obviously destined for villain status.  And while all of the characters are foils for Agatha, one female character turns out to be a little too much like the heroine herself -- a darker and nastier version, to be sure, but sharing Agatha's penchant for impossible crushes on unreachable men.

Agatha needs to play against a strong character, like James Lacey, or compete against a truly interesting villain.

But not to worry -- I absolutely love Agatha Raisin and hope she doesn't give up on the detective agency.  Like most professionals who retired too soon, she needs a new career!",3,"[-2.398373549130608, -1.4387654743533975, -1.0965472207472227, -1.0277553334188874, -1.056896745954595]",-1.0277553334188874

Barbara Cameron, in this second novel of her Stitches in Time series puts these thoughts to rest. Not only do they have the same problems we do, for the most part, but maybe more as we are usually more free to be individuals, nor are we as able to 'hide' behind our parents and siblings. Certainly, some of their difficulties are different than ours, but underneath all of that, there is a common thread. We want to be loved and accepted. As we travel with Leah and Noami we see the growth in Noami as she strives to become a wise woman like her grandmother.
Barbara has an affinity with the Amish, and this comes out in her delightful stories. Together with her we see behind the story, the things thought in secret.. I enjoyed taking the 'min' vacation to Florida with Leah and Noami and though I feel I have been there now that I read this book, felt the white sand between my toes, learnt to know others at Sarasota.
Although this is the second novel in the series it is a stand alone book. However, I am sure you will enjoy both titles, and together with me wait for the next one.

5832,"This book was a surprise - I didn't expect to enjoy it 5-Stars worth, but I did!  I read mysteries almost exclusively, and I am getting used to many of the story patterns, but this book gave me a few new twists.  I'm also used to ""detectives"" being in almost every profession, but never encountered one like Allison, an image consultant. And the other characters bring a lot of depth and interest.  I love the support group ladies!  The strain between Allison and her sister is quite believable, and her office assistant, Vaughn and especially his brother Jamie, all contribute well to the flow of the plot.

The book starts off with a murder .... even before we meet Allison, so the author wastes no time in getting her readers to the action.  Then, we meet Allison on the job, being approached by a shady politician with an upcoming election; he wants Allison to do a ""make-over"" on his rebellious daughter, Maggie - a difficult teen - so she won't deter his voter popularity.  Although Allison normally does not work with child clients, she accepts this challenge and the tumultuous interaction between Maggie and Allison begins.  Allison starts to see beneath Maggie's faade and wants to help her, especially when crime evidence starts pointing in Maggie's direction.

I notice that some have said that this book is ""dark and psychological.""  I would not call this a psychological mystery, and it is not THAT dark either - although, of course, you can't have a mystery without a dead body or two.  And for good measure, the author tosses in a few red herrings to challenge the reader.

I'd say this book forms the start of an excellent series, with the author bringing the cast aboard and showing how an image consultant could encounter situations leading to the need for some amateur sleuthing.

Not surprisingly, her exploration of the paranormal turns up a lot of lack of evidence. I was not familiar with things like ectoplasm, near-death experiences, and attempts to capture ghosts with cameras and tape recorders, so I was fascinated by the foray into people's efforts over the centuries to find (or fake) evidence of the afterlife.

Although in many ways quite the same. Each woman is fighting for her rights in the best way she can for the era she lives in.

The one common goal that can help each of them is a contest that took place in the 1940s to 1970s called Miss Subways. This is an actual competition that occurred in New York City during that time frame and its incorporated into this fictionalized story.  The author does a wonderful job of mixing actual history with fiction.

As a native New Yorker, I was immediately interested in this book. Who doesnt enjoy books set in their hometown? To make it even more enticing to me is that both girls are from Brooklyn, which Im from as well. I could easily transport myself right into the middle of it all.

I never read anything by Susie Orman Schnall before, but this book won me over. The characters are vividly portrayed and leap right out of the pages. The author paints a realistic portrayal of New York.

This book has everything from drama, romance, and even a couple of eye-opening twists. I knew some surprises were coming, but I wasn't quite sure how it all would work out.  It tugs at your heartstrings.  My eyes were blurred with tears by the end.  I can't say enough good things about this book.

Even though it was a departure from the authors norm of contemporary fiction, this historical fiction was completely riveting.  I also learned things about Roman society that I never knew before and I loved how Mr. Singer even treated some known facts with humor.

Essentially, Mr. Singer has written a book with the idea that Luke and Acts sound like legal briefs  would it be possible that they were written to a lawyer, Theophilus, to get him caught up to date to prepare for Pauls trial before Nero?  So we get the story of Paul woven in the book, but also the fictional parts about Theophilus and how he fit in Roman society.  Of course Mr. Singer has done extensive research into Roman society to bring many details to life  from the vestal virgins to the gladiator games to the problems in outlaying provinces.  We even get an understanding for why Pontius Pilate acted as he did.

He has made a list of all the things he want to do before he dies and that means traveling back to Willow Lake and Camp Kioga.  He hires a private nurse and sets out on his way.

Meanwhile, George's grandson, Ross is returning home from Afghanistan as  he has completed his tour of duty and the whole family is counting on him to ""talk sense"" to his grandfather and get him to return home for treatment.  When he reaches Camp Kioga and talks to his grandfather, Claire the nurse and reviews his grandfather's medical reports, even talks to some doctors after a trip to the emergency room for George, he realizes he has to bend to his grandfather's wishes.

One of the first things George wants to do is reunite with a brother he has not seen in 55 years, then he also wants to skydive, ride a Harley, and have a big family reunion.  As Claire and Ross work together to make everything happen the grow closer and closer, (something that was also on George's list.) but her past keeps holding her back.

Kate who after many years of marriage and two children is told by her husband that he is leaving her for another woman.

While I normally avoid the paranormal genre, I do love a good ghost story. Emphasis on good. The story and the ghost. Im not into evil or creepy paranormal beings, thank you. I very much enjoyed both the story and the ghost in The Perfectly Proper Paranormal Museum. It always helps when there is a compelling historic mystery surrounding the ghost, in addition to the present-day mystery plaguing our main characters. But not to worry  if you aren't into ghosts at all, this book is definitely more cozy mystery than paranormal suspense.

Along with the mystery  full of suspects that kept me guessing (my prime one was killed off early on so much for my amateur sleuthing abilities lol)  a very light hint of romance threads through the plot. And when I say hint, I do mean that. The hint solidifies into something more viable toward the end, but remains just out of reach & sets the stage nicely for further development potential in future books.

Im not sure yet if there are one or two possible romantic interests for Maddie.  The clear frontrunner is hunky Mason. But theres definitely some sort of electric connection between Maddie and Slate.  I just cant tell if its romantic or something else.  Perhaps some paranormally-type connection yet to be revealed.

Bottom Line: The Perfectly Proper Paranormal Museum is unique, well-written, and fun! The quirky museum, the array of likable characters, a curiously intuitive cat, and a ghost who may have been wrongly accused  these elements all give a creative twist to the usual cozy mystery formula.  With enough romantic potential to satisfy people like me, it also is the perfect choice for people who prefer more mystery than kisses.

I hadn't heard of many of these men before (please don't judge me) so I got to know some interesting figures from history that I wouldn't have learned about otherwise.  I also liked how the author focused on the good influence these men had on the world and the way they stuck to their guns and didn't back down when faced with pressure.  This is a collection of impressive men that relied on God to see them through the challenges they faced and were able to accomplish amazing things because of it.

Since I knew little to nothing about most of these men before reading this book, I would have liked more information about them than what was included.  Most of these men had very eventful and interesting lives and it was difficult to get a sense of that with a 30 page mini-biography.  However, if there had been as much information as I'd wanted, the book would be a monstrosity.

He couldn't be the one to ruin the relationship she had with her father.  But he was miserable.....he missed her so much.....his brothers were worried about him.  Each one of them came by to see him with their words of wisdom to help him along.  But his feelings for Chloe keep getting in the way.  He figures he is just meant to be alone for the rest of his life.

I love his story.  The author has done such a good job with Chance...you feel everything right along with him and then you cry for him.

That said, I thought this tale to be filled with intrigue and adventure. And yes, romance too.

Both Elijah and Cate, are trying hard to not fall in love, but cupid has other plans for the two. As they begrudgingly start to work together to solve the mystery, as well as the death of his brother, they slowly start falling in love.

If you love your romance to feature plots of mystery and adventure, this one will definitely fit that bill.

868,"This novel explores the vulnerable imagination of thirteen-year-old girls still clinging to innocence but on the verge of the knowledge the world bestows, stripping away the fragile cocoon of childhood, where magic is still possible, but demons lurk in the darkness. Best friends and neighbors, Lizzie Hood and Evie Verver share everything until the summer before high school in their Midwestern suburban community when Evie disappears. Refusing to relinquish Evie to the terrors that the adults have already assumed, Lizzie clings to hope, drawn to Evie's family and the unfolding emotional drama of a handsome, loving father, a goddess-like older sister and a ghostly mother, even more insubstantial since Evie's disappearance. Lizzie desperately wants to help as she slides smoothly into Evie's environment, dredging up memories, searching for clues the police might have missed. A girl in crisis who cannot find traction in her own fatherless home, Lizzie is lost without Evie- and the family that has welcomed her throughout childhood.

While Abbott captures the intimacy of friendship and the often unreliable impulses of young girls' hearts, the beat of disquiet thrums, secrets bloom in the dark and emotions collide even before Evie's disappearance. The shining family, repository of Lizzie's happiest memories, shatters more the further she is drawn into an emotional vortex beyond her ken, both rapturous and vulnerable as her discoveries aid the search for Evie. This novel bridges the chasm between childhood and reality, Lizzie vaguely conscious of what she knows but cannot bear to acknowledge. This tough novel is filled with horrors, perhaps too slight to bear the weight of its terrible revelations, the truths that fill the shadowy places of the Verver's home. Vacillating between seduction and brutal frankness, Abbott holds a mirror up to society's faade, Sleeping Beauty staring into the eyes of evil, poison apple staining her lips.

Although there were a lot of characters to keep straight, I found the author's writing excellent and each character came alive for me. I really enjoyed the setting of Chattanooga and the historical facts she brought into the story. I found this made the story more interesting as I enjoyed the history.

Peter is running the bank and his integrity is a breath of fresh air. I love how he is always trying to do the right thing, even regarding his partner's daughter, Mary Beth. When his partner is dying, he asks Peter to watch out for Mary Beth and this adds more complication to his already complicated life.

I really enjoyed this book and it was a very pleasant read. I liked the intrigue, romance and history. I learned some things as well as being entertained. If you enjoy historical fiction romance, you'll truly enjoy this book! I give this book 4.5 out of 5 stars.

Patience arrives in Nevada City, Montana Territory in the spring of 1866 to take over her inheritance,  her grandmother's boarding house.

When farmer Jamie becomes depressed after being left alone with his farm and its animals to care for, his friends decide he needs a good woman.

When schoolteacher Lydia gets out for the summer, her friend gives her something to look forward to besides remaining at the beck and call of her widowed, ailing mother.

This is not a romance, even though it sounds like the beginnings of one. It's a reminder of how inhumane caretakers of children can warp lives. It's also a portrait of how hope is an integral part of the human character. It's also a story of how strange life can sometimes be.

5652,"Dramatic and fated, this conclusion to Crown of Lies is one dark romance that grabs you and never lets go till the last heart-pounding page.

I was painfully impatient and needy to read this because I craved to uncover all the secrets, and to see Penn redeem himself from all his lies and his ill treatment of Elle. And, believe me, he does. So does she!

This strong woman realizes many things, too, and fights her own guilt. Yet this novel jumps from one terrifying obstacle to the happiness to another with scary celerity. I cringed at the severity of Elle's ordeal at the beginning of this second and last novel. She suffers so much, yet is always strong, resilient. The wods describe both her helplessness and her bravery so vividly.

SPOILER

The only thing that was confusing for me is what happens after she is saved from her ordeal. She goes to Penn's home without waiting for the police to give a statement and have evidence gathered of her bruises and mistreatment.

END OF SPOILER

Anyway, all the past injustices and hurts coalesce into the present, drowning Penn and Elle in another wave of despair that prevents them from being together, of healing their wounds and start anew. That part was incredibly intense and harrowing. They hate and love each other with ferocity, and it was amazing to read!

The characters fight to the bone for their freedom to enjoy love at last. It's a tale of atonement, of restitution, of lust and need and forgiveness and wrongs so raw that they become yours. I admit that Penn was stubborn as hell and he dragged the impossible nature of them being together too far. I'd have cut out his last stand and make-up scene, but it all paid off in the end. Impressive dark romance.

1581,"Of course it's very hampering being a detective, when you don't know anything about detecting,  and when nobody knows that you're doing detection, and you can't have people up to  cross-examine them, and you have neither the energy nor the means to make proper inquiries; and,  in short, when you're doing the whole thing in a thoroughly amateur, haphazard way.  -A.A. Milne (The Red House Mystery)
A.A. Milne is, of course, best remembered for his series of Winnie the Pooh tales.  In addition, he wrote for the famous British humor magazine Punch, was a fine playwright and, though he served in WWI, became an outspoken pacifist.  In the midst of all this, he wrote one of the classic English drawing room mysteries--The Red House Mystery.  The book ends on a note which seems to imply that further adventures will follow, but sadly none did.
The Red House is a British manor, home to Mark Ablett, and gathering place for his fun loving friends.  But the bucolic setting is disrupted when Ablett's long lost brother, black sheep of the family, is murdered and Mark goes missing.  Two guests, Antony Gillingham, a sort of Holmsian jack of all trades, and Bill Beverley, a mildly dense Watson-like sidekick, take it upon themselves to solve the crime.  What follows is a reasonably dated but still amusing ""intuitive"" mystery.  Raymond Chandler apparently went out of his way to attack the story as one of the worst examples of the genre, wholly lacking in genuine criminological methodology and requiring enormous intuitive leaps on the part of the ""detectives"".  Still, take it for what it is and it offers a pleasant enough reading experience.

Author: J. Nathan
Five Stars
In For Finlay by J. Nathan we meet the watergirl of the University of Alabama football team.  Finlay Thatcher is in her Freshman year but she sat out for 2 years to deal with some personal issues and to try to find herself again.
Caden Brooks is the star quarterback, but, he wouldn't have been if things had been different.  Caden is a playboy and Finlay convinced herself 2 years ago that no matter what she would ALWAYS HATE Caden. Or would she?
Caden has been assigned by the coach to gain the friendship and respect of his offensive line.  To do this Caden has decided to throw a party at his house.  When Finlay arrived everyone was off in their own corners not mingling together.  Until Finlay got them all together to play drinking games and to bond.  This improved the morale of the team and made them work together.
Caden and Finlay found themselves thrown together a lot.  They kept getting closer and closer and Finlay couldn't help but to like Caden even though she made herself a promise to HATE him.
This book follows the couple through rough times and times of truth and trust.  Can Caden understand why Finlay kept the truth from him?  Can Finlay forgive Caden for being a Jerk and jumping to the wrong conclusions when Lindsay told him lies, and he believed Lindsay and wouldnt listen to Finlay.
This book touches all the feels.  I read it from cover to cover in one sitting as seems to be my prefered way of reading here lately.  Enjoy this college sports romance.  I sure did.

Shes one of those heroines who doesnt like asking for help when she needs it.  Shes enamored with Everett but still wary.  Shifters are known but nobody really trusts them yet and they are ok with that and keep to themselves.  Everett has this idea to be like his father.  Which isn't a bad thing but he happens to have 5 mates and has produced 19 cubs.  So, Everett wants 3 mates to reproduce and have cubs.  Maybe not as many as his father but close to it.  In a way this totally freaks Maisie out and she refuses to be Everetts mate because she doesnt want to share him.  Good for her!  She stands her ground!    It takes him quite awhile to understand where she is coming from.  Everett is different hes kind of a caveman/old world/chauvinistic type of guy.  Hes sweet and totally alpha and very protective but he doesnt seem to understand human females that well.  LOL.  At the risk of losing Maisie who he wants really badly he realizes he loves her and cant live without her.  If that means he only has her as a mate then hes ok with that.  Jay her ex is a creeper and a little bit crazy and comes after her a few times.  She has this best friend Lisa.  I liked her at first but she turned on her in a way and pretty much was a specist.

It has romance and examples of heroism, as well as the painful realities of struggling to survive in a war torn country, food rations, homes being raided, families sent to fight for the Nazis, and others sent to work camps and to the death chambers.

2002,"While historical romance may be the subgenre I gravitate toward within Christian romance, every now and then a contemporary romance will come along and impress me. Made to Last is full of great plot twists, wonderful characterization, and sweet and funny moments. While it may not be set in the past, the ""foreign"" and ""formal"" situations (the world of TV stars and big-name reporters) still swept me away to another place, and I enjoyed the excursion very much.

One big conflict propels the story along, but constant added conflicts or new twists on the effects of the big secret keep the story moving along at a nice pace. I loved the contrast between Miranda's mountain home (and other country situations) and the craziness of being behind the camera, featured on a widely read celebrity blog, etc. And Tagg did a marvelous job of crafting the story in terms of the seasons. (Something I had to focus on, of course!) The themes of letting go and dying dreams correspond with the leaves falling from the trees and the cold winter weather setting in. And yet there is hope as the hero and heroine learn how to face those seasons and find the precious truths hidden beneath the piles of leaves.

With an intriguing cast of characters and the right mix of the familiar/realistic and the exciting/imaginative, as well as a delightful dose of humor, Made to Last is a memorable romance story. Tagg's writing resonated with me, and I can't wait for her next book, Here to Stay!

2112,"Jane Lewis had thought of herself as Plain Jane for many years. During college she had been overweight and shy and had witnessed the rape of Connie Bryan, a beautiful classmate, engaged to be married immediately after graduation. Connie was terrified of her fiance's reaction to the brutal attack and made Jane swear not to involve the police or tell anyone. A short while later, Connie committed suicide and Jane has been haunted with guilt and felt she should have done something to help Connie.
Years later, Jane Lewis is a successful psychologist with a popular radio talk show, when an old college classmate, Michael Sorenson, introduces himself. Jane is now slender and beautiful but still thinks of herself as plain. She is immediately attracted to Mike, who is also a successful psychologist, and he encourages her to delve into the past to rid herself of the guilt she has suffered for so long as a result of Connie's death.
Trixie and Fred, Jane's godparents, the people she cares most about, are eccentric and endearing and funny. They are co-authors of a long-running, successful series of action thrillers. Trixie and Fred, as well as Jane, adore their dogs and treat them almost like human beings.
In her efforts to uncover the long-buried circumstances surrounding Connie's death, Jane becomes involved in some dangerous situations. Fortunately, with Trixie, Fred and Mike watching out for her she never strays too far into dangerous territory.

I figured the best way to dive into the m/m genre was to read one from an author whose books I love. There was a serious disconnect for me with this one though. The explosive chemistry and the spark between the characters that was so prevalent in the previous books, was missing from Cory and Judes story. I just didn't feel the connection between these two guys.

Cory is a tattoo artist at Raw Ink and Jude is the guy hes had his eye on for awhile. Jude spends his days at the skate park, keeps to himself and hardly utters a word. Cory has no idea if Jude would even be interest in him, or any other guy for that matter. After a series of run-ins between the two of them, Cory wants to get to know Jude even more. He has the perfect opportunity when Jude books a tattoo appointment with him.

The development of their relationship and the storyline was lacking a bit for me. Both Cory and Jude had heartbreaking pasts, but it didn't help to cement their connection for me. When Judes past finally caught up to him, it was wrapped up way too easily. It all felt a little underwhelming.

The story begins in 1984 when Solomon is 87 years old and is told in a series of flashbacks.  While ghosts do feature in the story, it's really more of a tale about the life and mysteries surrounding the family of our narrator, Solomon Wayfield, as a young boy growing up in rural America at the turn of the 20th century.

The plot and writing are decent, but the author meanders on a few occasions. The tenor of the story is rather subdued, so that the writing may appear slow at times.  I found the transitions between the past and present day to be a bit clunky.

She manages everything, including her brother, the Duke of Ravenwood's home. She can foresee pretty much any possibility and leaves nothing to chance. One would almost think she was prescient, but no, just highly organized with a gift for memorization utilizing word association.

Collins creates an entertaining narrative as he contrasts pairs of companies: A&P vs. Kroger, Abbott vs Upjohn, and more.  Why do some survive and become great while others quietl fade away?

Unlike many authors who share cozy anecdotes, Collins offers solid analytical distinctions.  The survivors faced reality, recognized their strengths, got rid of deadwood and provided quiet leadership.

My favorite chapter features the Stockdale paradox. During eight grueling years as a Vietnam POW, Admiral Jim Stockdale determined he would survive and would save as many fellow POWs as

possible. Regardless of anyone's position on war and military, Stockdale demonstrated rare courage and was credited with saving many lives.

When Collins asked, ""Who was least likely to survive?"" Stockdale said, ""That's easy - the optimists.""  Those who anticipated being home by Christmas were the most discouraged-- most likely to give up on living.

In a world of chirpy coaches urging us to ""Think positive,"" this view seems realistic and refreshing.

I also liked the story of Nucor, a small company that outpaced Bethlehem Steel. While Bethlehem built office tours to accommodate demands for corner offices, Nucor stayed lean and mean.

In between their meeting and their loving, there's a game of indoor croquet for those readers who can't get enough pall-mall in a Julia Quinn romance.  And speaking of Julia Quinn stories, this James romance isn't any better than what Quinn churns out.

I couldn't even find James's trademark clever, intelligent writing.  There's some terrible grammar in this novella written by an English professor.  How about this sentence, for example:  ""Oliver scooped her up and LAY her on the bed.""  I had expected James to know the difference between ""lay"" and ""laid"".

This is not really worth the read.  Although not very expensive, it's also not very well developed and not interesting.

722,"My initial reaction after reading this book is one of pronounced ambivalence. Although the author intends to examine the factors that might have shaped his life into success and his namesake's life into tragedy, he spends most of this very short volume telling their respective stories (in a very serviceable and easy-to-read manner) without providing much analysis. The majority of the book tells his own story (which is to be expected), and the alleged eerie similarities that exist between Wes Moore the author and Wes Moore the convicted felon just aren't there. Yes, they share the same name--something that probably isn't all that rare--but beyond that, the similarities are few. I don't begrudge Wes Moore the author his success, but his purpose in writing this book is somewhat nebulous. He has every right to be proud of his numerous accomplishments, but juxtaposing his own life--an undeniable success--with that of a convicted felon (imprisoned for life for a crime he might very well be innocent of) just seems a bit too cruel.",2,"[-2.3115170333745754, -1.4230657961792461, -1.0454657974156067, -1.0402172211834204, -1.169634794750421]",-1.0402172211834204

1205,"In 1925 one of the world's last explorers, Percy Fawcett, traveled into the heart of the  Amazon jungle with his son for his last expedition in search of a lost civilization.  It was a worldwide publicized event, with Fawcett writing journal entries and having a messenger take them to the nearest large town to be sent via telegraph to the rest of the world.  Then the entries suddenly stopped and Fawcett was never heard from again.  Expeditions were made to discover what happened to them; nothing was ever found, while some more people were lost to the Amazon.  The Lost City of Z  is the story of Percy Fawcett, his life and how he became a great explorer, and where his obsession for the Amazon came from.  It is also the story of the mystery of this doomed last expedition, and all the efforts - some ending in tragedy - that have been made since then.

David Grann is a staff writer for the New Yorker who first found out about Percy Fawcett while researching an article on the mysterious death of the world's foremost Sherlock Holmes expert.  The Lost City of Z takes Grann all over the world, from visiting Fawcett's great granddaughter and seeing some of his original journal entries, to putting together his own expedition to find out what really happened to Percy Fawcett.  The Lost City of Z is the incredible story of one of the last explorers, but it is also the story of the strength of the human spirit and it's drive to never give up.  Percy Fawcett was a real life Indiana Jones and this is his fascinating story.

477,"Anne Frank went into hiding , in 1942, with her parents and sister and four other people , in the sealed off back rooms of an Amsterdam office buliding , when the Nazi invaders of the Netherlands , intensified their persecution of Jews.

They were all dicovered in 1944 , by the Nazis, and of the group , only Anne's father Otto Frank survived the war. Anne died in the hideous death camp at Belsen.

In this remarkably intimate and beautifully written classic , Anne documents the two years in hiding - how they survived , amusing observances about the different residents of the house , as well as her own remarkable development , such topics as her sexuality and the development of her relationship with Peter Van Daam , as well as her sparkling brilliant intellect.

She reveals the peculiarities and personalities of the people who live with her in the annexe , in a series of accounts and amusing anecdotes.

One could ask why the Nazis brought about the death of this good , intelligent and charming child. One should ask what moves man to commit such horrors. What moved the Nazis to kill over a million Jewish children. What moves people  to justify the murder of Jewish children in Israel today by Arab terrorists , or to justify the monstrous tyrannies in North Korea, Red China, Zimbabwe or Iran?

The book can equip young people to answer the questions that will be thrown at them today: Why did the Nazis do what they did? Why did the people of Europe allow it to happen? Why do we need the State of Israel?

We are living in time when values are distorted , moral relativity and the inversion of the truth are the order of the day. Anti-semitism is on the march again , in the shape of genocidal hatred of Israel. It is today that it becomes so relevant , Anne Frank's word in her diary: "" It's twice as hard for us young ones to hold our ground and maintain our opinions , at a time when all all ideals are being shattered and destoyed , when people are showing their worst side , and do not know whether to believe in truth and right and God'.",4,"[-2.5177160746924097, -1.3381713557693566, -1.0888260842566104, -1.0410834880380853, -1.0510804447532074]",-1.0410834880380853

1302,"I first became familiar with Sarah Vowell's work via her radio appearances on NPR's ""This American Life"". While she brings an unapologetically slightly left of center view to her work, she also brings the subjects she examines to vivid life in ways that are insightful, humorous and reflect strong academic discipline. While her overall approach may be not be appreciated by staid historiographers, for those looking to plug gaps in their knowledge of historical subjects: she is a great resource.

""Lafeyette in the Somewhat United States"" explores the role of the teenage general, Gilbert de Motier, Marquis de Lafayette in the American Revolution. Centered on Lafayette and his access to the military and financial might of France in assisting the US colonies, it expands in a series of other examinations, to include Lafayette's relationship with George Washington, the politics of colonial military command and the larger evolution of diplomatic relations between France and the colonies.

Vowell is very effective at providing context on what is really going on in the background of the rather staid documentary records of events from the late 18th century. She does this in ways that are often laugh out loud funny and useful for providing contexts on issues we face in the modern world.

I started placing dog ears on the funniest passages as I read...and then stopped, because she is witty at every turn, and she uses this wit to effectively illuminate what she writes about. About his arrival in Charleston, Vowell quotes Lafayette's letter: ""Everything around me was new...the room, the bed draped in delicate mosquito curtains, the black servants who to me quietly to ask my commands...the luxuriant vegetation..."". Then she provides this interpretation: ""In other words, it was a buggy swamp full of slaves."" While some might bristle at such irreverence, it has the undeniable quality of bringing life to the often stodgy presentation of traditional history.

I grew up in parts of New Jersey that the armies described in this book traversed while moving men and materials between New York and Philadelphia. No teacher or local historical society ever succeeded in bringing the history of the area to live as Sarah Vowell does here (although Annie Garvin came close!).

Willem retraces his steps to discover how he ended up in the hospital and sets out to find Lulu. Along the way he tells the story of his family and the great disconnect between his mother and himself, and learns more about himself then he thought he knew.

I don't read a lot of contemporary YA fiction. I have a couple of favorite authors that write contemporary YA fiction and I generally try to read/listen to their books. These include Maureen Johnson, John Green, Rainbow Rowell and Gayle Forman. I loved the If I Stay/Where She Went books and also Just One Day (the first half of this series). I'd heard mixed reviews about Just One Year, but I decided I needed to know how Willem and Lulu's journey would end.

After having finished the audiobook of Just One Year, I have to say this was the story that ""I"" wanted told. It might not be the story that everyone wanted to hear, but it was the one I wanted. I wanted to know why Willem had been travelling for so long, never stopping long, never spending any real time with anyone. In Just One Year we find out why he is this way and what it takes to make him keep his roots in Amsterdam. We find out the story of his past and his family, and how the disconnect between his mother and himself and his Uncle starts to narrow and they become more of a family. We delve into his acting and feel his passion for it. It is a beautiful story.

Gayle Forman writes a beautiful story, and I enjoyed every minute of it. Loving travel myself, I loved all of Willem's travels from India to Amsterdam to Cancun - it was a great a adventure! I loved all the colorful people he meets on the way and we meet his friends in Amsterdam and his family. It was a great story and even though I personally would've liked more Lulu, I still loved every second of it.

Daniel May narrates Just One Year and gives a great voice to the character of Willem. There is a diversity of accents in this book and he delivers them all superbly. I wouldn't hesitate recommending this series to YA fans. I do recommend starting with Just One Day though to get the full experience of these two books.",4,"[-3.305802198726627, -1.591074115658413, -1.0775141300613051, -1.0457037745803952, -1.1342038023567835]",-1.0457037745803952
3765,"The book description calls Patricia Forde's The List ""Fahrenheit 451 meets The Giver for middle grade readers!""  That seems pretty apt.  The List is cut from the same cloth as the recent trend of teen-oriented post-apocalyptic and dystopia fiction.  While this whole genre of YA novels would point to classics like Fahrenheit 451 and The Giver as sources of inspiration, none of them measure up, including The List.

Letta, Forde's young, female heroine (most of these have young, female heroines, of course) is the assistant to the Wordsmith of Ark.  Ark was founded by an environmentalist named Noa (haha) who became frustrated when no one heeded his warnings about the rising sea level.  He established Ark, the ice caps melted, and his new city was high and dry, seemingly the last remnant of human civilization.

Noa, the authoritarian leader of the tightly controlled community of Ark, believes that language was the root of all of humanity's problems.  ""Our aim is to curtail the use of language,"" he tells Letta, who becomes the Wordsmith after her mentor disappears.  ""As you know, throwing words around is quite irresponsible, considering our history.""  His public agenda is to limit language to The List, a list of a few hundred words.  His private agenda, which Letta eventually catches wind of, is much more insidious.

The List isn't bad.  It checks all the boxes for the genre.  Noa is a caricature of the evil dictator with a charming side.  The central planning and the enforcers of societal structure are stock as well.  The List is not wholly cookie-cutter, but it was not original or well-written enough for me to love it.

2846,"Those readers who have ever felt like their hard work has been slighted, not taken seriously or even ignored, will relate well with Patience, the acting headmistress of Rosemere. And having a novel start with the hero being followed is a sure way of creating suspense. Sarah Ladd's novel tugged at my emotions from the very first line and kept me turning pages until the very end.
While reading this novel, I felt I was in the school, enjoying the many antics, frustrations and exuberance of the young girls who had been placed in the school. The idea of sending young children to a resident school is very foreign to me, yet I relish the idea of the growing friendships that would result in this. The customs of the day, including the fact that a woman unmarried and over the age of 21 was considered a spinster seems unusually harsh in our day when a lot of women choose not to marry until they are older. Sarah, through her story, enlightened me while still entertaining, on what life in England in 1816 would have been like, and what I could have expected to encounter. The lessons that Patience learned, are still valid today.

I enjoyed this novel immensely, and trust you will as well

1216,"Michael Crummy's quirky ""Galore"", with  sparks of brilliant writing was, unfortunately for me a considerable let down.  Landscapes and human prospects are equally bleak in a town ironically know as Paradise Deep and one more aptly named neighbor,  Gut.  Inhabitants are invariably (and soon) tiresomely quirky.  Characters like Devine's Widow, the matriarchal wiccan contrasted to a drunken and sybaritic RC Father Phelan.  Protestants v. Catholics and children like Mary Tryphena grow to marry not their heart's love but the washed ashore detritus that reeks of dead fish. Good luck...

Indeed Mary Tryphena, Judah and Absalom are the exception, being somewhat fleshed out.  People sort of float in and out without much purpose except to move the years along.  Crummy never stays with anyone very long so Judah may or not be a lucky talisman; Jabez Trim and his wife ache for children and ultimately succeed but we hardly know of their joy.  Indeed, joy and even satisfaction are noticeably absent from the lives any of these Labradorians.  Everyone just sort of drifts from crankiness to misery to shortage to bad weather-- flotsam in nature's harsh and uncompromising universe.

I don't think it necessarily bad that the author depict something so dreary and unpleasant, but I would like to know why anyone in their right mind would want to stay in such a harsh and depressing place. Habit?  Lack of imagination? Masochism?  When Absalom is banished for falling in love with his first cousin I wanted to shout ""run, Abie run, and don't look back.""  Banishment seemed like the lotto jackpot.  Unfortunately we don't know what ties these folk to such a miserable and forbidding place.  And that is a pity.

There are actually two stories told here, some of it we know but Mair never has all the answers.

Minerva is the English neighbor and Gloria, the Amish homemaker, and the two have never gotten along.

This book greatly saddened me in many ways as I thought of my mother and father being born during the early 1930's and I knew that times had indeed been very hard for them.  What I loved, though, was their hope in the land.....hope that the vegetables they grew in their little family gardens would sustain the family through the winter.

208,"We first met Maisie Dobbs in the Spring of '29.  Now it's the Summer of '32 and Nazi sympathizers are starting to come out of the woodwork in Britain.  Maisie finds herself doing some top-secret undercover work  for Special Branch as a philosophy teacher at a college dedicated to pacifism.  There's a murder.  Maisie's  old friend Sandra from Ebury St. becomes a widow under circumstance that also suggest murder.  A smudged postmark suggests James has not been leveling with  Maisie about his whereabouts. The Beales are on the move. Frankie takes a back seat in this one--perhaps because he's too busy courting.  Stratton's clearly unhappy with his new job and new boss.  Plagiarism enters the picture  as a major plot point.  And a new character,  Margaret Rose, gets added to the cast. Never a dull moment, as usual...

And, as always, Jacqueline Winspear delivers another great read in this, the 8th  in her Maisie Dobbs series. Because it's so strong on character development and relationships, this is a series that really should be read in order.  Here's the list:  1. ""Maisie Dobbs,"" 2. ""Birds of a Feather,"" 3. ""Pardonable Lies,"" 4. ""Messenger of Truth,"" 5. ""An Incomplete Revenge,""  6. ""Among the Mad,""  7. The Mapping of Love and Death,""  8. ""A Lesson in Secrets,""  9. ""Elegy for Eddie. 10. ""Leaving Everything Most Loved"" (coming 3/13)",4,"[-2.684221715815587, -1.6279554237690963, -1.133781907008607, -1.0700367395171007, -1.1750449630246664]",-1.0700367395171007
