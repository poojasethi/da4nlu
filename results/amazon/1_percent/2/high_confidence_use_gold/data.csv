It was a good idea for a plot, just dropped,
There are 69 critical reviews always check critical reviews before one clicking. I learned my lesson.
It is young, The writing was childish. It is like the writing was all over the place.
And I absolutely hate a book, where the characters go back and fourth til the end, I can not connect with the characters.
It was to much stupidity, I did not finish this book. The worse part is I did not start the book til 10 days after one clicking so I am stuck with something I did not like because I can not refund it.
I do not like cheating. These characters are just so young, you would think they was in middle school. Actually middle school students probably are more mature then this.

It was so almost a good book, really.  Almost.  But I skipped huge chunks because I was disgusted beyond belief at how beyond stupid-gone-to-seed the heroine was.  STUPID. Another one of those women who know better than everyone around her so subsequently endangers everyone around her.  Then there were times ""No I'm not doing that"" then two seconds later she's doing it - or the Hero is. The continuity was pretty bad - I mean I know people change their minds but constantly, Every other page?  I really hated the heroine. I cursed my Kindle and wanted to throw it when she did stupid things. She was so doggone immature, selfish, self-centered, and I challenge you to believe she really loves the Hero. Love gives not takes. Love thinks of others first not themselves.  I got to the point that I didn't care about her past - it made her selfish so who cares?

OK OK - I'm fine now.  I really did want to like the book.  It's not bad but when I skim that much, it's also not that good. Once I take a dislike to a character I always HOPE they somehow redeem themselves so I can like the book - that never happened.  I won't be reading the next in the series because, honestly? I can't take the pain of her stupidity and I just flat don't care. AT ALL

The intriguing idea is two dopey teens poking around an abandoned mental hospital discover a naked girl chained down to a table who isn't alive.  But she's not exactly dead either.  But she's hot, for a zombie.  And naked.  You can see the possibilities coming but the film doesn't decided whether it's a horror film or a comic horror film.

In fact, the script doesn't make a lot of decisions that help with the great idea.  Why couldn't the more thoughtful teen dig through the lab to find out who the girl was and how she ended up chained to a table?  The writers indulged the scumbag teen who uses the deadgirl for his own gratification but left the other teen thinly developed and weak.

I admire the filmmakers for independently creating a vision...but the vision wasn't prepped enough to become a professional horror film.  Characters aren't developed, ideas aren't followed through, good ideas are thrown in but then left incomplete.

Certainly the most confusing movie I've seen, this film instantly landed a spot in the top 5 worst films I have fallen victim to.

How did it get made?  That's the real mystery.  There weren't better scripts out there?  I could write a better script if I simply sat on the keyboard.  (Believe it or not, after this turd, somebody actually gave this guy money to direct another movie -- although not based on his script.)

It's like they gave a 14-year-old kid millions of dollars to make a movie and a single afternoon to write a script.  The script has no ideas or insight about anything -- terrorism, war, the media, the political machine, Marxism, you name it.  The movie is impossible to take literally (everybody's looking for Boxer, yet he can just go to a sidewalk cafe?), yet has nothing coherent to say on any allegorical level.

I am a great fan of almost all the stars especially Michael Douglas and Shia LaBeouf.  I finally thought how bad can it really be and ordered it on demand on cable.  I am writing this review to warn everyone - with this movie it honestly is not a matter of opinion, the movie is just plain terrible.  I don't get how people are going overboard criticizing the acting for there is very little for any of the actors to do.  I blame this disaster on Oliver Stone and him alone.  He is obviously trying to make a statement on money, its business etc.  No point is made and there is no story.  All the actors walk through each scene like zombies for the entire script is ridiculous.  There is no emotion for the acrtors to grasp onto.  The scenes where tears are shown are laughable for they are so poorly written and directed.  With this movie there is no beginning, middle or end.  When it was finally gratefully over I just felt like I had wasted 2 hours.  I had no idea what the point of it all was.  I really want to know what power Oliver Stone used to convince all these A list actors to participate in this terrible film.  He has created and directed a true mess.

I very rarely write such negative reviews but I must be honest and feel people considering watching this film or even God forbid purchasing it should be warned.  It is not being ridiculed for it is a bad sequel but for the mere fact that it is a bad film.  Liking the actors is not enough to get through it.

I mean, despite what the blurb suggests, it doesn't even have a main character. What do you do with a book that doesn't have a main character or couple? What do you do?

There's insta-lust and a relationship that goes from 0 to 4,000 in about a page. There is endless agonizing over if the characters are a couple yet and if they're gay or not, all in artificial and exaggerated ways. There's pointless past trauma that is too much to be believed.

There is telling, telling, telling about how wonderful and significant and 'I'll be with you forever even though we've been a couple for 2 days' the characters feel, all adding up to basically nothing. Nothing that happens is believable. None of the emotions read as believable, not even the lust (though that's not really an emotion, I suppose).

All the things a highly trained soldier would take in stride (and we're told they do) they are shown to whinge about. And the technical aspect of these soldiers?

I was really disappointed.  I found both Sed and Jessica incoherent,  badly written characters who were impulsive and fundamentally uninteresting.

It would absolutely harm her future in corporate america if she worked as a stripper,  but still,  she did it. It would absolutely make a difference to her law school if a sex tape came out,  but still she kept putting herself in situations where it was almost inevitable.

The writers attempt to reveal the mistreatment of Muslim women in particular is noble.  Her life story is one of many emotions, trials and tribulations and the efforts on her part to seek equality on behalf of others reveals a great mind in a great person.  It should be fair to say there are many more like her stymied by their religion and background and yet of equal mind if not courage.  I say this because no single ethnic group or religious sect has a monopoly on brains regardless of gender.  Many people are simply what they are taught to be.  To avoid offending anyone I seldom discuss or give thoughts on religion.  I am not knowledgeable enough to discuss the various aspects of the various religions but like many (I suspect) I entertain my own thoughts and opinions.  While this book taught me some about the particular religion involved it made light of the brutality of life for women living under the justification by that particular religion.  I despise anyone involved in the mistreatment of women.  Certainly in my life I have known bar flies who maybe rated a dope slap but the constant abuse and mistreatment of any woman rates as a punishable sin.  I cannot always say they are the fairer sex unless by fairness one means their attitude and treatment of others, male or female.

1543,"I was annoyed and frustrated through 80% of this book. The reason is, that by my standards, the author does not play fair with the reader. Here are two examples. The book opens with the protagonist having a breakup fight with his girlfriend. Some of the characters in the book know the reason for this fight and how it relates to another incident, known by almost all, they discuss but which is held from the reader. Instead, they make oblque references to both.

This leaves the reader ignorant but the books players informed unlike, say, an Agatha Christie novel where the reader is invited along to solve the mystery with the protagonist and both parties having equal information.

Then again, this withholding of information results in a final 20% that has an enormous impact on the reader. Ive rarely read a book that has this much power, excitement and satisfaction in the wrap up. Its plainly masterful. All the loose ends get tied, plot get mysteries solved and were finally clear or at least less muddled if were reading a thriller, a mystery, a horror novel or a supernatural tale. I wasn't sure until the end and, in a way, still am not.

Another issue is that the protagonist isn't likable  even in the least. By the end, many will have sympathy for him while others will detest him. Im in the latter camp, but I do understand the fellow maybe more than I wish to.

I can recommend this book without reservation, but wish the author would have somehow avoided creating that sense of annoyed frustration I had through a good deal of the books length.

In chapter 5, There is a stalker after Sky, he has killed a woman in her home in her room. Both main characters are werewolves, they can scent the smell in her house. Both characters stay while waiting for others to come. They start to kiss, they feel attraction towards each other. Then, chapter 5 ends. Right there is when I stopped reading.

If I am a female werewolf and can scent a human woman dead in my house(by stalker), I am not going to stay there one minute longer. Plus two, knowing the evidence in the home, I would not feel attraction after the fact. Chapter 5 ruined everything. The other issues I over looked until then.

In the first book, Dons quirkiness (somewhere on the Aspergers Spectrum) was a major player in the book, but it wasn't the only player.  The other characters seemed to have more to contribute.

In this book, Dons behavior seems so forced and so contrived.  Every single thing he says and does is tainted with his quirkiness, to the point of absolute annoyance.

For example, a woman is about to breast feed her baby.  Here is the quote from the book:

The discussion was interrupted by the arrival of a nurse carrying a baby which I assumed was Sonia and Daves.  I was well aware from the Antenatal Uproar that social convention took precedence over maximizing immunity through the sharing of breast milk.

Sonia commenced the nutrition and immunity-improving process.

That last sentence was just annoying.  I cant see Don looking at every single thing like this.  I just don't remember the first book being so constantly over the top like this.

For me, I had to force it in, but it did ultimately fit. I worked it into the lint filter opening of my dryer, after removing the lint screen. I am hyper-vigilant in clearing out that screen, but I always worry about a build up of lint inside the machine. As I worked with it, I could hear ""clumps"" of lint going into the crevice tool. At one point, I had to cut off the vacuum because so much went in that it clogged the narrow opening of the attachment! I removed it from the vacuum and had to use a blunt tool to loosen the clog and knock out the rest. Immediately, I emptied the canister of my machine, and there was a good deal of lint. I know that it was not carpet dust that had been there before, because it all had a very strong perfume smell of detergent and softener.

To be sure that all the dryer lint was removed from the attachment, I carefully ran water through and stood it upside down overnight to drip dry. I ordered this thinking I was just taking a gamble on something that probably would not work at all, and to my delight it works perfectly.

Removing two stars because I've been hassled by telemarketers since the day they ported my phone number. I had ZERO problems with telemarketers before Ooma. Now I get constant scam calls. Two things: first, if you're on the do not call registry, they don't tell you this, but you need to sign up again once you port your number. Then, someone has clearly sold my info to telemarketers, and there's no warning of this, either. The only solution Ooma offers is to sign up for premier service to block the numbers-- so basically, now I would get to pay a monthly fee to fix a problem Ooma created. No. And the free call blocking program NoMoRobo doesn't work with Ooma Basic.

I called customer service about this and they promised to have a supervisor call me back. No one ever called me back.

Angry.

--
I thought this was too good to be true, but it's actually real. Setup was simple, the number was ported within a week, no echos or delays, and it's been reliable and clear ever since. I'm now paying less than $5 a month for taxes instead of the 35 or so that I was paying with my cable company. I can use it with my existing phone system and its built-in voicemail or use their voicemail, or both-- which is the option I'm going with-- my old phone system wouldn't kick over to voicemail if I was on the other line, but now it does because of Ooma. I didn't need any bells or whistles, so I'm not using Premium features, just the regular ole' service.

Beyond the fact that it was rather formulaic, which many books are these day, but it didn't really do anything to make this formula of a story stand out from the others.  If anything it bored me.  I found myself frustrated with the characters lack of communication (I hate when that is the sole reason a couple has issues) and found myself skimming a large section of the book.  Even with skimming I didn't finish the book as quickly because I kept putting it down.  I lost interest in the characters as a couple but still wanted to know how things would end. Funny enough the epilogue was the one part of the story that I did not skim and was intrigued by.

Liese and Ryder just did not feel very three dimensional to me. I wanted to learn more about them but never felt like I did and that resulted in a missed connection.  Supporting characters worked well, even the stalker issue that came up.  However, the way that issue ended was very abrupt for me and a little unfinished.

For me there was a lot of potential here but it just fell short.  The plot could have been developed more, the characters even more so.

Tate was one of Letty's tormentors in High School and she had hoped that college would be different but when Letty sees Tate in one of her classes she doesn't understand what is going on. Why is Tate there? It's been two years since the brutal incident and she never expected to see him again, let alone be paired up with him on an assignment on sex in the cinema.

* the writing was in present tense a lot of the time which I don't enjoy
* there was a lot of head hopping to the point I was getting Will and Daniel confused and having to reread a lot
* I was completely confused and thrown off by the author's note at the beginning about this being almost fantasy and that's why there's no condoms or jail...I started reading thinking it was going to be a fantasy world/alt universe type thing...but, no, it was in the US just no condoms or jail.
* A small private school with a plethora of gay teachers and students willing to have illicit affairs
* I wanted more about why Will was the way he was
* the writing was hard to follow at times, especially early on (it seemed to get better as time went on, or I just got more used to it) It jumped around sometimes and then went on and on and one sometimes.
Now, all of that said, I thought I was going to give up on this book, but I couldn't. I fell in love with Daniel and Will. I was cheering them on. I ached for them in their situation.

As for Bodi I really didn't care to much for him, and I don't even know why.  Tessa at one point was drinking  and she goes to lay in Bodi's bed, all I could think was when was the last time he changed his sheets, is she going to brush her teeth wash her face.  It just grossed me out.  I have also read this a few times in books, I cant figure out why a girl who has never had sex would use a vibrator that is just weird to me.

7412,"After looking at the selection of RFID wallets, I decided on this make and model. I have been unable to find anything wrong with this wallet as outlined in some of the negative reviews. I chose the brown color. The wallet is  made from very thin material and , yes, there is a crinkling sound when the wallet is opened and closed or the bill separator flap is moved. I don't see this to be an issue and just people nit-picking. I've only had the wallet a day or so and it is holding my stuff firmly in place and I don't see anything that would indicate the wallet is fraying or coming apart..., yet.
Now, this wallet is definitely overpriced by about $10-$12 dollars in my estimation. It does feel cheap and I guess the RFID blocking works. I have no easy way to check. I did receive an email asking me to give the wallet a 5 star review for reasons I find unworthy and objectionable.
This is not a 5 star wallet if all factors are considered. I 've had expensive wallets from Italy and this is not in the same class. My review is taking into consideration the price, workmanship and what it is supposed to accomplish with RFID blocking.
In conclusion, the material is thin and the wallet feels cheap and the price is high. On the other hand, I think t was the best pick from the Amazon RFID wallets. I don't expect this wallet to last more than one year at the high end.

I was expecting something miraculous and wonderful.
It wasn't that.
It was a decent read.
The author is a fantastic storyteller and can write quite well.
The plot and characters is where it wasn't always great for me.
Vicious is an a-hole. A huge one throughout the book. I love alpha jerks. They are some of my favorites. Except he never made much sense as to why he was that way. And the 'vicious' things he did to this girl was unforgivable IMO. I'm all for revenge and alpha a-holes but they have to have a reason to be liked in the end... to make up for WHY they were the way they were. He didn't IMO have a legit reason aside from the fact he's just a Jerk and... even though she was defiant and funny and didn't take his crap. In the end she did and caved. I'd expected Hate Sex. Or More of a passion... plus better written sex as a whole. This book is not erotic in the least. The sex is tepid. I think if that part had been better I would have given the book 5 stars.
All in all it was an interesting read.
I think there wouldn't been more suspense had there only been 1 Pov.
I would recommend.

Sound quality seems a bit 'hollow'.  But, I've just set it up and will fiddle with it some before I make a final decision.  Spoken words are MUCH clearer.  I don't need subtitles for female whispering at this point.  A nice improvement.

I am using this rug in my mud room in front of the door.  It looks really good/pretty in that spot.  This rug is not a plush & thick rug.  It is pretty but utilitarian - exactly what I was looking for.  It is thin enough to go under an open door but thick enough to collect drips & dirt from shoes.  I like that it has a rubber back so I don't need a rug pad under it.  And it is inexpensive enough that it doesn't feel too ""precious"" for dirty shoes.

The colors on the website are fairly accurate.  Very pretty & not too busy.

It came rolled & in a box.  It laid flat right away with just a little curl at the very end that had been the inside of the roll - it flattened within an hour or so.  I gave it a quick vacuum to take off the white factory fluffs - the rug does not seem to shed.  I think the fluffs were from something else because they were all white.

If you wash this in your washing machine, make sure to choose the gentle cycle.  I owned another rug just like this from the same company & washed it on the Heavy Duty setting.

228,"I'm going to be brutally honest - I didn't have big expectations going into Eve. The synopsis doesn't tell you exactly what the terrible secret is that Eve discovers, but I had a sneaking suspicion that although it would be shocking, it wouldn't exactly be unexpected.

Having lower expectations is not always a bad thing, and I believe those lowered expectations helped me enjoy Eve much more than if it had been a book that I'd been eagerly awaiting - I'm going to call this a 'comfort dystopian' - it's fun (as dystopians go), easy-to-read and moves along at a fair pace.

Eve is incredibly naive, and at first that bugged me - I mean, really, you live in an all-girls-school and you think that when you graduate you're going to live a normal life? There was a virus that killed most of the human population, maybe you're being slightly unrealistic? But after a while, I ignored my irritations and just enjoyed the story. None of the characters are completely fleshed out, and there's a big dose of insta-love between Eve and Caleb, but none of the characters are completely irritating.

Ms. Carey has some interesting ideas for a dystopia, along with some disturbing ideas on how the world would repopulate itself after such a devastating virus, a megalomaniac ruler and how quickly humans can degenerate into some pretty shady characters. The world-building is a little lacking in history and explanation and Eve makes a pretty quick turn in her view of the world, but it forms a solid base.

I don't really know what else to say about Eve - it didn't blow me away, but it certainly didn't make me want to headbutt anyone either - I think my description of a comfort dystopian is quite appropriate for how I felt about the book, but it could be brilliant for a reader who isn't completely comfortable with the grittiness of some dystopian worlds.",2,"[1.649165296893659, 0.24403231369017342, -0.044509619281509094, -1.0049945778727172, -2.2748724031378513]",1.649165296893659

2316,"So I started this book annoyed because it starts with an author note about it being a draft. Drafts don't belong on Amazon, whether free or not. Free books are for getting increased circulation and reviews that will encourage buyers to pay for the book. They aren't for getting test readers and free editing. But the note made a big deal about it trying to hurry out an extended version because he realized he screwed up putting it out with a cliffhanger, so I thought I'd be nice and read it (I've done a lot of test reading for several authors in the past). So I finished my reading ABSOLUTELY FURIOUS! Besides the fact that it is in desperate need of some semblance of editing and overall makes very little sense throughout, the stupid book still ends on a cliffhanger.

So the author should get this draft off a BOOKSTORE (you don't go to a bookstore to pick up drafts. Drafts belong on writer's workshops, with test readers who sign up to be test readers, and on editor's desks. NOT IN A BOOKSTORE!!) and turn it into a real finished book with decent editing and without a cliffhanger before putting it back.

Since the author has pissed me off, there is no way I am going to give him any of my notes of what needs to be fixed. I only edit when I get compensation for my work.

The premise of the story had potential but I found the storyline actually was forgotten and lost. It was replaced with constant sex, that contradicted the characters backstories. Much of the prose was quite repetitive and i will say the word detonate now leaves a sour taste in my mouth.
Kian, the main character had merits in his protective and caring nature.
Brynn was an interesting character and I think she could have been so much more given her history and where she was coming from. Unfortunately, I felt she often contradicted herself with her actions given the fears she held.
Overall the story did not draw you in-- it was repetitive and the sex was filler rather than story.
The secondary character Sage and her backstory seemed like it was thrown in and didn't really go anywhere or make you really want to find out more about her.
There truly was so much potential to this story but it fell short. And honestly if an ebook is going to cost $4 it really should be edited. There were countless spelling and grammatical errors-- many of them affected how the sentences read.

274,"I love stories where the ""big girl"" finds love, so I expected to absolutely love this book.  Instead, it left me a little cold.  At one point about 1/3 of the way in I put it down to read something else for a week or so.  That is not a good sign for a romance!

The bottom line is that I didn't love the characters and didn't find their romance to be believable.  But a lot of things contributed to that feeling.  I'll try not to give spoilers along with my reasons.

First, I hated the passage near the beginning of the book where Logan has sex with his then-girlfriend.  I understand what the author was trying to show about his attitude toward relationships and what his girlfriend ""type"" was, but I don't want a detailed sex scene between the hero and another woman in my romances!  And I never really warmed up to Logan as a hero anyway. There was nothing to explain why he had such an aversion to commitment.  I also didn't buy into his ""I want her/no I don't want her"" phase when he was feeling physically attracted to Holly but kept telling himself he wasn't.

Chase and Amanda's little ""kink"" was distracting, then annoying and finally uncomfortable.  They are a big part of the plot but I didn't need that.  And I didn't believe that if Holly had only one close friend in high school and no friends in college, she'd make such a personality change as to become close friends with Amanda and then be so outgoing in some circumstances but still an emotional hot mess in others.  That inconsistency in the character's personality made it hard to really like her as a character.",2,"[1.6257260581188961, 0.1870818870665787, -0.22965714720131558, -1.0226123298201453, -1.7014311924420593]",1.6257260581188961

It just flew at me, paragraphs here and there, glued together to make a chapter.  Then suddenly none of that mattered. I was sucked in (finally) to Winter and Braxxon's (and everyone else) life and wanted to know the ending NOW.  So I pretty much read it in one day.

While some of the topics are pretty graphic and ugly, none were gratuitous. The writing was okay but I think the author will continue to get better and better.  She has amazing insight into some pretty terrible things, and handles them very well because there is pain, sorrow and heartache that shouldn't be trivialized. Some things I did NOT like were a lack of realism in things like the hero knows it is unbelievably dangerous for his woman to be going out but he lets her go somewhere with only another woman with her, a woman whose loyalty he questions?  Huh?  That doesn't fit with all the other wise choices they make to keep safe.  Things like that.

101,"Prior to reading Lehane's last book, Moonlight Mile, I thought it was impossible for me to be disappointed in a book by a writer I considered to be a master in creating rich, complex ""real world"" characters and dialogue that sounds ""fresh from the streets."" Moonlight Mile strongly shook the foundation of my thinking.

However, despite my disappointment, I perceived Moonlight Mile to be a fluke and firmly believed that Lehane's next book would be representative of the high standards I've come to expect from him.

Now, after finishing Live By Night, I was disappointed for the second consecutive time and, thus, I no longer consider Lehane's ability ""to deliver the goods"" a sure thing. As a matter of fact, unlike in the past, I will no longer be willing to read a book just because Lehane wrote it.

It's not that Live By Night is a bad book; in fact it was entertaining enough for me to finish it. It is not, however, a book that I'd recommend you rush out to read. My reasons for this are as follows:
...the plot (which can be read about in the Amazon Book Description above) is not very original, nor is it very believable;
...the characters lack the depth I've come to expect in a Lehane book, with many of the characterizations being somewhat cliched; and
...while the book is pretty fast-paced, it was not compelling enough to make me want to read it for long periods of time without stopping. In too many instances I found myself needing to put the book aside due to my losing interest in what was occurring in the story.

As I said, Live By Night is not a bad book, it is just not a very good one. I'm sure Lehane fans, and particularly those who enjoyed The Given Day, will be inclined to want to read Live By Night, regardless of reviews that are somewhat critical of it. However, I hope this review will be helpful in preparing you for what you can expect should you decide to read Live By Night.",2,"[1.4872489514416531, -0.5620591389920524, -0.7432883697193554, -1.020385941716839, -1.2019039605110147]",1.4872489514416531

This was interesting, but when I find myself skimming a book I can't bring myself to give it more than three starts.  Boring is boring, and this book is boring.  There is a good 400 page novel hiding here, but those extra 150 pages are doozies.

Angels & Demons reads like a sort of 'testing ground' for Da Vinci, and while many of the parts that made Da Vinci a thrill ride are present in Angels, the parts don't work cohesively to give the same thrill. There is way too much detail given here about Vatican history and way too much time is spent dwelling on protagonist Robert Langdon's thought processes regarding artwork.  I found myself skimming pages at a time in order to get to the next important detail.  If I wanted an Art History lesson I would've taken a course in college about it!

Put down the pitchforks. I have Hooker dialed up on my Kindle and will be diving in shortly because, damn, I need to know more!

Strong, brave, and independent, Permilia is highly entertaining since you really don't know what she's gonna do next! ;) (I also personally felt there were touches of Anne in her personality) Then there's Asher.  A true gentleman, and when it truly counts he comes through!  And those sub characters?! :D  I ABSOLUTELY CAN NOT WAIT for the next book!!!!

Just a day ago I read a book that brought out raw emotions, I cried a lot. I read through the tears. But this book, this one was all together different.

Making Faces, is about facing ones own demons and finding that beauty is beyond skin deep.

She does it in a way that you catch the meaning & the lesson behind it without it sounding preachy or in your face.
Love heals all, forgiveness sets us free.

I was going to title this review ""airheaded,"" because that's my one-word summation of the game.

But in a moment of absent-mindedness, when trying to get to THIS page, I accidentally typed ""airheaded"" into the Amazon search engine, rather than ""Crysis.""

The spooky thing is that, at least as of the date of this writing, when you type in ""airheaded"" into Amazon's search engine, ""Crysis Maximum Edition"" is the first search result returned!  Like Amazon was reading my mind.

Or, more realistically, I can't be the only guy thinking that this game is a little short on, uh, pabulum.  Not that a first person Armageddon-style shoot 'em up is supposedly to be heavily intellectual; it's just that we've seen this so many times before:  you go around shooting a whole bunch of monsters, gradually acquiring more and more powerful weapons until basically you're fighting Satan himself at the end.

Good stuff!  Classic.  But there's not a twist in sight here, it's just the same ol' same ol'.

And it seems like they could have even thought out the brainless butchery a little better:

1.  The first section has you tromping through the jungle wasting a bunch of Asians.  What innovation!

2.  The second second is, admittedly, trippy.  It involves floating through a Jefferson Airplane-style alien mothership.  Promising, but brief.

3.  Guess what happens in the final section?  You've seen it a million times before.  Only here your final adversary is so close and the camerawork is so shaky that you can hardly tell what's going on.

INSIDIOUS is the twentieth book in the FBI Thriller series by Catherine Coulter.

Point of View: third person
Setting: Washington D.C. and Los Angeles
Tense: past
Sexual Content: none
Pet Peeves: none
Couldnt put it down! INSIDIOUS restored my interest in this series.

I have to admit I was unsure if I was going to continue reading the FBI Thriller series by Catherine Coulter. The previous two books were not as great as I had expected. Then, I read INSIDIOUS. It restored my interest. I thought it was a great story, so much better because it was more focused and didn't hop around so much. I was allowed to stay in one place for long enough to become vested in the characters and their problems. Also, there weren't as many point of views. INSIDIOUS is told primarily through the eyes of Savich, Sherlock, and Cam. We do see some other point of views in the book, but not as many as there were in POWER PLAY or NEMESIS.

Although I will continue to argue that this series doesnt fit in the thriller genre like the name implies, I thoroughly enjoyed reading INSIDIOUS. It was a great mystery novel; I was kept guessing about the identities of the villains until the end. Catherine Coulter did a great job of making me doubt who I thought the killers were. Every time I thought I had it figured out, she would throw something in there to make me question myself.

Due to the audio perspective, I just couldn't finish this one - not necessarily due to the storyline or anything from the author's perspective, it is just that I found the narrator's voice about as annoying as anything I have heard in a long time.  To give you an idea of what I am talking about, to me the guy sounds very similar to the voice on all of the annoying GEICO Insurance commercials I hear on the radio.  To top it all off, each time there is a female in a dialogue, he switches to an even more annoying falsetto voice to represent his ""female"" side.

In other words, I made it through the first CD and finally decided life was too short - I would rather listen to the radio or a music CD.

Regarding the story, with the first portion I heard it really sounds like something I would pass on - shallow people, shallow characters, and really no redeeming qualities I would want to remember.

To my surprise, the book is extremely well-written and well-paced. Lieberman creates an unusual character in an unusual setting - a kosher meat factory - with a plausible story of how a bright guy ended up working there. The protagonist is sympathetic and three-dimensional. The author creates an environment that's almost too vivid. Meat factories aren't exactly places where most of us would want to hang out. The pace is fast and furious.

So what's not to like?

Somewhere around the halfway mark, we get the punch line. Then there's a lot of action but very little mystery. It's still well-written and easy to follow, but we can guess the main outcomes.
If I were stuck on a long plane ride, I'd keep reading. As it is, I skimmed.

I had high hopes for this one, unfortunately, I didn't really care for it. The plot definitely sounded interesting, I just didn't like how it was executed.  This was a long read (or maybe it just felt that way because It wasn't holding my attention).  It was slow moving until about the 75% mark .  I had a hard time liking the Hero, Ric.  He has this entire revenge plan in place for his step-sister Annalesa.  Honestly I had a hard time justifying his motives.  I liked Annalesa.  She wasn't an evil person, she was just young and had a hard time standing up to her friends and boyfriend.  Maybe if the story flipped back and forth between past and present, getting Ric's POV, we could understand his anger better.

If there's a problem it's that the writing rarely becomes sufficiently  compelling to make the reader feel that we really know what it is like to have Alzheimer's. The most convincing part is the opening of the narrative when Alice first discovers she has Alzheimer's. I have to admit it's a difficult  book to write because Alzheimer's is a disease that forces people to become increasingly disengaged from those around them (so there is a kind of internal contradiction that probably isn't resolvable).

7943,"I have always used liquid glues and always got stuck fingers when it dripped on to my hands while trying to fix something. This  also happened when I tried to puncture the tiny hole at the top of the tube to get it started. Glue would always spurt out with barely any pressure on the tube. I  kept a bottle of nail polish remover handy. More frustrating was the fact that there was hardly any glue in those tubes. So much was wasted.

This gel sure makes a major difference. First, the directions for puncturing the top are that you twist the top until the clicking stops. I have no idea what is going on in there, but it sure beats trying to do it the other way. When I took the top off, no glue came out until I gently pressed the sides of the bottle as directed. GEL! So nice to be able to put a drop of glue where you want it, and not have it go where you don't! This container is rigid everywhere except on a small strip on each side where you can gently press to expel the glue.

The name of the game here is ""control"". You will have control over this glue, it will not be a race to get the dripping glue where you want it. This gel sets far faster than the liquid so there is no need to hold anything together until it sets. No more need for massive piles of newspapers or other coverings under your project. A simple sheet of paper towel will be adequate.  This will free you from ""glue anxiety"". Not to mention the embarrassment (fun?) of having to pick off stuck-on glue from your fingers for days.

I didn't think it was possible to create such a world in a story that takes place in an average city in an average time. But, she did. Now, there were no dragons in this story, but there was plenty of magic and plenty of the fun and imagination that I really enjoy in Donita's stories.

I was pulled into this story very quickly because I liked Cora right from the start. She is a very nice and likable character. She is a character that I felt an instant connection with and one that I felt deserved happiness - and deserved to go to a magical ball. It also didn't take long for me to like Simon, and of course, his sister Sandy stole the show many times.

I would say the only part of the book that I didn't love was the end. It was the happy ending I was hoping for, but the book just sort of ended and it felt a little flat.

Basically, Easy A beat them to the punch with a better cast and script.

Throw in the odd choice to place the movie in the '90s yet a lot of it looked more like the '70s was bizarre. Seriously, most high school movies are in the now as it's teenagers who watch this fare by and large. Unless I'm missing some untapped group of people in their late 30s who want to relive the '90s?

296,"I've been actively avoiding the New Adult genre up until now. Seeing as I only started reading Young Adult books two years ago, I really shouldn't be so genre-snobbish - I mean, surely New Adult books can't ALL be ALL about sex, right?

So I was hesitant to pick up Losing It. I actually objected to the whole synopsis, right from the beginning. I'm not going to preach on about how girls should consider their virginity a treasure blah blah, because (and yes this may be TMI!) I didn't. However, the fact that Bliss is still a virgin and seemingly suddenly decides to find a random guy to 'lose it' to didn't really sit right with me. And in fact, in the opening scenes of the book, she seems to keen to get it over and done with, I wondered why if it had been bothering her so much she didn't do something about it sooner....

As the story progressed, I came to like Bliss a lot more than I thought after my initial impression. She's funny, awkward and more than a little confused about exactly what she wants in life, love and her career so she's very easy to relate to. I did think that Garrick was sweet and a genuinely nice-guy, but I didn't actually feel that character crush moment - perhaps having an English boyfriend myself has made those British accent's a little less enthralling ;).

There was the expected and inevitable drama and misunderstanding, and some turmoil and sneaking around with the whole professor / student relationship which did feel like it wasn't taken all that seriously and some passionate and well written intimate moments (man I feel old calling make-out / sex scenes 'intimate moments!).

Losing It isn't completely predictable, but it didn't set my world on fire either - it's the kind of book that I enjoy when I don't really want to have to think about what I'm reading or struggle with emotional or moral dilemmas Overall this was a fun read, and I breezed through it pretty quickly. By the end I was enjoying the characters and their interaction, and Bliss and Garrick's story is certainly sweet and cute.",2,"[1.3211636793934582, 1.0913654449663515, -0.058171461400959856, -1.0060059834205928, -2.467179711065156]",1.3211636793934582

1071,"I've forced myself to p. 406, but the stupidity of this novel really makes me piss off greatly and the patience simply worn thinner and thinner. What a lousy novel Daniel Silva had written! The scenario is not a bit convincing, the plot absurd, the characters, especially Elizabeth, the wife of Michael, is the most annoying and disgusting female characters I've ever read in the last 30 years, a constant whiner married to a CIA guy. This marriage and the relationship between this pathetic couple is so stressful to read. If I were the assassin, I'd like to assassinate the wife first! If you already knew that the assassin was on the way to kill you, you, as a seasoned CIA case officer, would still like to jog daily and regularly in the winter without carrying a weapon? Besides, what a ridiculous secret club/society Daniel Silva had created. Shamron, the Israeli intel service chief, was one of the goofy members?

The most disgusting arrangement by Silva in this novel was that he conveniently used all those characters' descriptions in this novel and copied them into his next Gabriel Allon series. The assassin, October, was exactly the same as Gabriel Allon, women characters also copied and pasted into his next series. Sarah shifted into the next series with different background and nationality, everything in this novel was so effortlessly transfer into the next series without any new creativity, just copy and paste. The thing I really don't get is why Daniel Silva would have created an annoying character such as Elizabeth in a thriller? Any word about her characters, profession and marriage in this novel only served negatively and purposelessly.

I can sit here and say this book didn't make me feel, but that would be a big, fat lie because, oh did it. My heart shattered and my emotions were all over the place.

Natalie Gilcher is happy and content. Shes married to her high school sweetheart and shes pregnant. Her husband Aaron, is away on a convert mission overseas and is expected home really soon. Being a NAVY wife, Natalie knows the protocol and she experiences firsthand the dreaded moment that no person should ever be a part of.

That knock at the door.
Aaron is gone and her world is shattered.

Natalie is dead inside and only lives for her daughter, Arabelle. Shes alone and not even the comfort of her friends and family can pull her out of the void she feels.

Then we meet Liam Dempsey.
Liam is Aarons best friend. He comes into her life and spins her world upside down. The more time spent together, the more they feel attracted to one another until they can no longer deny what they feel.

Oh Liam *sigh*. Dreamboat is beautiful, a NAVY Seal, sweet, swoony, sexy and protective. He loves Ara and hes absolutely PERFECT!! Natalies strength saves him. Shes that light he needs, the one he can look forward to when he goes into battle.

Together Liam and Lee endure loss and pain. But they fight and they overcome the ghost of Aaron. They love and feel, and there wasn't one moment they weren't respectful of Aarons memory.

This story taught me that sometimes its pointless to fight the strong feelings. That sometimes you just have to take the bull by the horns, so to speak. But most of all, that its okay to believe in love again.

The conflict between the hero and his ""betrothed"" took forever to resolve and although I was initially into the story between him and the heroine, it got old watching them vacillate between lust/love. I thought the whole ""class warfare"" shtick was overdone. I grew up in Southern Mississippi and even in 2002 (when the book was originally published) we're more progressed than that small minded ""You can't marry outside your class"", crap. I highly doubt Texas would be worse than us but I digress.

I've read another series by this author before and enjoyed it tremendously and don't know what she was thinking with this book. The characters were juvenile, milquetoast beta males/females with no backbone who thought with their genitalia. The first half was decent enough to continue but it got worse the longer I read. Several breaks were needed to slog through it until the end because by the time I realized I wanted out it was already too late. There was a lot that got on my nerves with the story but I will say the end was somewhat sweet but too long in arriving. The wrap-up was decent but for all the sh#t you have to dig to find, it's not worth it. Read her ""Perfect"" series instead.",2,"[1.2732041771237435, 0.46219587797873274, -0.2664429679905296, -1.032071272426015, -1.6887312853101295]",1.2732041771237435

1. The snark was constant. I understand this is supposed to be a humorous romance, it was way over the top.

2. Everyone was putting their hands down their pants or were holding their crotch etc. Excessive.

3. Dove seems to be normal. No one I know would let a man that doesn't shower often, eats an abundance of beef sticks, and has his hands in his underwear all the time into their car or their life in general. He's gotta smell bad and his hands are covered in ball sweat. EW.

4. Duke is failing at adulting. I got that the first few examples that were given. I'm not an idiot. He did put a kitten in his tightly whities. I GOT IT.

4a. Dove just stood there and let him keep the kitten in his underwear. She did nothing. Help the kitten and call the ASPCA!

5. The craziness never stopped. Ever. It made the story unbelievable. No one's life is like that. It had more snarky and crazy moments than an entire season of Friends. SEASON.

No one has any common sense.
I can actually go on with my list but I have other things to do.

I had no idea the lengths major corporations go to track information about you and use it to their advantage, such at the stories relayed about Target.  And I mean REALLY track information...they actually created a computer algorithm which could pinpoint, via purchases ( not pregnancy detection kits)  which women were pregnant and target them with coupons!  How crazy is that?  But it's happening, and more than I - and possibly you - realize.  Also discussed radio frequency ID in clothing and products to not only track what is sold in a store....but where it goes!  ugh!  This information was part of the greater information about habits - how we develop them, why we use them, how to see them for what they are and the effort required to change them.  I found it very very interesting. OH! I should tell you, (I have a habit of stopping short - haha)  it has to do with how our brains are wired and conditioned to respond.  Obviously it would be tedious if , when tying your shoes, you had to relearn that information each time.  ( or you could buy loafers at Target and have them tracked to your house and whereever you go....)  So your brain makes it easy and the next time you tie your shoes it goes faster and faster until you can tie your shoes without thinking about it.  So it's a cue, a process/action and a result.  to change habits, first you must recognize them as such and substitute the action phase....you get a cue..say after dinner cigarette - you have one - you feel relaxed.  so now, after dinner - you go for a walk - and come back relaxed...and do that over and over again until that is your new 'habit'",4,"[1.2337776781212422, -1.6395863788795162, -1.6898258536177442, -1.0051713570653602, -0.23039676160600264]",1.2337776781212422

So when references were made in this book, I was just confused. I also didn't like how much time was given to Trace and Ember especially all of their sex scenes. It was just annoying. I thought this story was supposed to be about Lucien and Darcy. And that story really didn't get started until about 35% in. There was really just too much going on in this book. Too much history, too many manipulations, too many characters.

Maybe if the hero had needed to look for the heroine - he had a PI on her the whole five hours of her road trip - there could have been some reasoning for his complete 180 degree change.  As it stands, I was sorry to read this shortie.  I need romance, not a woman who is forbidden to speak or even make any noise, and a man who shows her no care and treats her like a worn library book.  Eww.  I'm still not sure what her name was or if the hero even said it more than twice.  The end offers nothing to combat the dislike of the useless heroine and the self-absorbed hero.  The niece character made no sense.  If you are a Jordan Silver fan, of course you will buy this; after all, didn't I?

6991,"Ok.... so I'm gonna be a little up and down with this one, because I'm a little conflicted.
1. How is it believable that these kids are in high school? Does nobody pay attention to the brutal violence of almost killing someone on a somewhat normal basis?  Sebastian and his sister Cassandra almost kill Elle, I dunno.... at least once a week for four years and nobody says anything or does anything about it?  SERIOUSLY?

2. Since when does the Mafia care if someones 18, and extend that much time and resources on someone to see if they'll tell someone about a hit they saw carried out by them?  And why does Nero's brother Lucca seem terrible but also like he keeps throwing these two together?  I don't understand.

3. Elles arents cannot be that clueless.

4. What a very unprofessional lunch lady. Since you're doling out justice, why didn't she get a healthy smackdown?

5. Downright hilarious the way Nero talks to Elle and she just accepts it... Even when she attempts to have a backbone, she folds and just does what he says. Id laugh in his face.

Now, what I liked about this story was its concept. I like the whole Mafia family deal and I even liked how vicious these guys are because the people they go after, truly deserve it. I like Chloe and Elle and their friendship and I'm looking forward to seeing whats next. Id like to see Chloe with Amo, but I have a feeling she.ll end u with Lucca.
I hope the rest of the series is a little more believable and not as over the top, but like it or not... I'm invested.

This book just wasn't engaging me.  I cant exactly pinpoint the reason, but I think it has to do with some sloppy story telling.  Man!  How I hate to say that about one of my favorite authors!  But there were things in this story that just didn't make sense to me.  In most cases, I find Jill Shalvis to write smart stories.  This one had too many holes for me.  This is the peril of reading a favorite author from their earliest stuffsometimes you're going to get some not so stellar stuff.

I actually adored the hero, Noah.  I think it would have helped to have actually relived his issue that kept his grounded for 6 months.  It would have given me a deeper connection to him and a better understanding of his frame of mind.  Once I knew what he had been through I did feel bad and sympathize for him, but I felt a sort of disconnect from the event since Noah doesnt even really have flash backs or anything.

The heroine, Bailey, was likable but I didn't love her.  Ive seen some reviews saying shes an idiot.  I don't think thats true.  Thats where things come back around to plot holes.  I don't want to give anything away, but since when do people not look behind artwork for safes?  Theyve been doing that since the dawn of time (or the popularization of houses and safes anyway).  That was one of my biggest issues with this story.  Bailey wasn't doing anything that the goons who were after her couldn't have done without her.  Silly.

One of my pet peeves was played out in this book and Im sure that had a lot to do with my disinterest in it at times.  The constant withholding of important information to protect other people, talking in circles, trying to take a huge task on alone when its obvious that impossible.  Over and over and over.  It was too much!

The author must have done something right along the way though because I am interested in reading about what happens with the rest of the people at Sky High Air.",2,"[1.2256719076136373, 0.7740310141169569, -0.06178847178822933, -1.0461381827229634, -1.9515867134848677]",1.2256719076136373

1548,"As someone who lives in a rather snowy locale, I'm fairly familiar with the vaguely gnawing fear that's always in the back of the brain during the Winter months: ""What if I got trapped in a snowstorm?"" What if you got trapped in your car, or if the roads got so bad that you were unable to leave work or school or wherever you happened to be? This small, nagging fear takes center stage in Michael Northrop's second novel, TRAPPED.

 The high concept tag line for TRAPPED would have to be something like ""THE BREAKFAST CLUB meets ALIVE""....Seven students (Hot girls, Goth kid, bully, Jock and his two best friends) decide, for various reasons, to stay after school, and boy, did they pick the wrong day. A vicious Nor'easter has just blown into town, and unbeknownst to the kids, won't be moving on for at least a week. During that time, their town is covered in over a dozen feet of snow. The Teacher that was with them walks out to get help, and is never seen again. Left on their own, the kids raid the school for blankets and food, and seem to be in good shape to ride out the storm until help arrives......until the roof starts to give way under all of the accumulating snow.

 Northrop does a good job of making each of the trapped kids a distinct personality, and he keeps the suspense mounting, but the book kind of peters out towards the end, and it really doesn't end so much as stop abruptly. He also chooses to have a character save the day using a device that the reader has not been introduced to anywhere in the preceding 200 pages, and that's kind of playing cheap. It would have been easy to go back and do a few quick rewrites that could have been dropped in to introduce us to this very important plot device....as it stands, it comes off as a cheap Deus Ex Machina, and seems like a last ditch attempt to write himself out of a corner that he created for himself.",2,"[1.2152859001198664, -0.9034131182415718, -0.7886957800554452, -1.013685539093288, -1.3615857053241407]",1.2152859001198664

572,"I'd flopped on a bed in a luxury hotel in Amman, Jordan last spring and flipped through a magazine, landing on page with little blurbs about about books.  I was intriuged by a couple of titles.  One was a book about the international sex slave trade (still not available in the USA until this fall) and the second was IF ON A WINTER'S NIGHT A TRAVELER.

The little blurb said this book had ten Chapter Ones.  You read that right.  One book, ten first chapters.

I wrote these titles down and ordered the latter after I got back home.  And I just finished it.  Wow.

I won't try to explain everything that goes on in this book but I can tell you--and this was the part that really surprised me--I was able to follow it all.  Even when I suspected about two-thirds of the way in that my attention would waver and I'd lose complete track of this strangely-written book, I still knew what was going on.  I have to chalk that up to the writer.  I've gotten lost in far more conventional stories after wading through thick and ponderous writing...but not this one!

This is a book about books, about reading, about the solitary existence of readers and the fantastic journeys they find on pages.  The writing is particularly strong and I wonder how much credit the translator should receive.

4551,"""I have so much love inside of me thats all yours, and its been trapped inside. I need to give it to you, because holding it in is killing me.""

Once again, we have been allowed to enter the unique world of Penelope Ward. Sins of Sevin offered us a read of epic proportions that told of a love never intended, that led down roads undefined, and created paths that only few could possibly walk.

Nothing thats worth it comes easy. But when the payoff comes, it can be spectacular.

Love is beautiful. Watching two people fall in love is breathtaking.  Listening to their talks that bring them closer together makes us fall even harder for them. We cheer for them, laugh with them, and cry with them.  But we also must come to terms with their predicament and positions in life.  When we enter into Sins of Sevin, we cannot possibly be prepared for the depths that this story will take us, and the place in which we will be left in the end.

""You're my truth. Everything else is a lie.""

Sins of Sevin was such an emotional read.  Told in first person, dual points of view, leaving this book I was in a haze.  My heart and mind were so full, but at the same time had been completely emptied and left on the pages of Sevin. It was breathtakingly beautiful, but had a level of pain, remorse, and dwindling hope that made my emotions stretched.  I physically had a need to hold onto something in order to steady myself along the way.  There was so much depth and complexity represented in the story line and that followed into the characters. As usual, Author Penelope Ward established some wonderful secondary characters. One of these made me laugh so hard, and the other caused my heart to swell.  As every chapter and scene changed, I was so pulled in that I easily followed, feeling as if I were a bystander watching and listening.  Sins of Sevin is not only at the top of my taboo list, but also worked its way into my top 5 reads of 2015.

You cant choose love.  It chooses you, and once that happens, it doesnt let go.""",4,"[-1.9076259959697186, -2.754078512987032, -1.7580376115747216, -1.0326081914434322, 1.1942196033053845]",1.1942196033053845

Many people purchase a book by storyline for that reason I don't do storyline spoilers. I feel it is unfair to the author to describe the book when writing is their livelihood. When I review a book I consider the author(new or a seasoned pro) and these elements: is the plot carefully thought out and not rushed; are the characters well defined, likable and not one dimensional; has the story held my interest from beginning to end and most importantly is there an HEA.
Barbara Longley is a seasoned pro who knows how to write romance. I have read a number of her books and  Whatever You Need does not disappoint. Her book exceeded all my expectations. Her storyline was beautifully written and her characters well developed, believable and engaging. I loved the slow buildup in Wyatt and Kaylas budding romance. Their journey toward a forever love was electric. Both these characters struggled with relationship issues. There struggles and how they would overcome them held my interest and kept me invested in the story. I also liked the surprise twists toward the end which I never saw coming!

I was lucky to discover that ""Destined"" was actually book 2 of the Vampire Awakenings series before I jumped into it unknowingly, a fact that you could easily miss in the ""Passionate Bites:...."" boxed set.

Since I did discover that this was a Book 2 though, I wanted to look into reading Book 1 of this series before I jumped into ""Destined"", only to find out that I had indeed read the first one, ""Awakening"" at some time.  You can go back and read my review of it should you be interested.

I suppose you could read ""Destined"" without having read the initial Book 1, ""Awakening"", but you will be missing quite a bit of back-round information that would add to your enjoyment. And this needs any help it can get to make it more enjoyable.

Although this is a continuation of a family saga, most of the time I felt I was simply reading a rewrite of Book 1.

(Lawrence) have just moved to a new town. They love their new house and
the new friends they have made. They did move next door to a house that
4 years ago was the site of a brutal double murder. They were assured
that the killer was dead, but sometimes people don't know the whole
story. This is not a bad movie at all, I wouldn't say its that scary
but I did enjoy it. The one big problem with this is that there were a
lot of parts that seemed to drag and didn't really move the story
forward. I think the problem was that the story was really a good half
hour TV show type plot that tried to make it into a full length movie.
That doesn't always work. I'm not saying not to watch because it is
worth watching but don't go in expecting a full on horror movie.

First, the positives:  author Bart Ehrman is clearly a biblical and early Christian expert. (I am certainly not.)  He fully discloses his beliefs (he has moved from an evangelical christian to a non-believer over his lifetime).  His writing is commendably neutral - he is good at keeping his opinion out of the factual story.  And I learned a LOT about the 300 to 400 years following Jesus's lifetime.  The development of Christianity is covered in detail.  Now the negatives.  For me, it boils down to drowning in repetitive detail.  After a while, the facts and repetition became overwhelming.

Although this book started off good, I quickly found it to be somewhat tedious and boring. I was mildly curious about what the outcome would be, so I pushed forward until I finished it.

My rating: My first 10/5 stars for 2014.

My opinion: Good freakin' lord THIS BOOK WAS AWESOME!

If I had ANY faith in Hollywood not to screw it up, this would be a great book made into a movie-even if it was only a Lifetime movie. Alas I don't, so please don't touch it! Also, a complaint...I don't know what numbnut is calling this a chicklit book, so please don't insult it that way.

This book was incredibly well written, engrossing and heartwarming/edge of seat intensity that masterfully doesn't beat you over the head. I know it sounds sexist, but I still can't believe that such a strong, complex female protagonist was written by a male. There were so many ""lessons"" to walk away from in this book.

This book was so refreshing, non-""cookie-cutter"" read coming that came from the ""traditional"" publishing house. At first, my concern was that it was over-hyped. It wasn't!

My recommendation has been if you need to wait at the library for it...GRAB IT. It is one of those rare gems that is worth the $$$$'s.  I happen to feel that it boosted my reading experience by the feel of the paper. I have put the print copy of this book into my Amazon cart because it will be one of those very rare books that I read multiple times. Don't feel like grabbing the print version, it was fine on my ereader.

407,"While I've been very pleased with almost every other Elizabeth Berg book that I've read, this one just didn't do it for me. I really didn't like any of the characters very much, and they were very one-dimensional, and shallow. Zoe, Ellen and Griffin's daughter, while she was there, she didn't really seem to be. Know what I mean? She seemed more of just an object for her parents to fight about, and we never really got a sense of what she was going through.

And Ellen was such a drag. She was so immature, and weird. Why would Griffin want her back after the way she acted? And Griffin, while I initially felt sorry for him, I rapidly started losing my patience with him. He would stand up for himself one minute, and the next be all wishy-washy, and weak.

In the end I just didn't like this book. I skimmed the last half, hoping to avoid going around in the circles the first half presents...but no such luck.

Each day starts out by putting our focus on the reason were celebrating  the birth of Jesus and the change He makes in our lives. The Scripture and devotional then leads into the history of a Christmas hymn, along with the printed lyrics for our reflection. Each day ends with a seasonal craft or gift or recipe to make at home.

My favorite part of this devotional is the hymn histories and lyrics. I think sometimes we become so familiar with certain songs and carols that we sing them without really thinking about what the words mean. Allowing myself to stop and reflect on what Im singing, on the true impact to my heart of words such as So God imparts to human hearts / the blessings of His heaven or Good Christian friends, rejoice / with heart and soul and voice / now ye need not fear the grave / Jesus Christ was born to save!

Bottom Line: The whole book is excellently done and very sweet. Tons of great gift ideas that will pamper the people you love and give your presents a heartfelt touch, not to mention the yummy recipes I cant wait to try!

9443,"Saw this on the airplane.

While the premise of a teacher who hates her students is definitely serviceable, I was annoyed by two things:

1.  In the movie, the teacher's supposedly brutal sense of humor was too soft.  She really should have been much crueler.  I think this is because the film was going for the wrong sense of humor.  It was going for the shock-joke nature of comedy, while it should have been aiming at a sardonic, ironic kind of humor.  I kept waiting for her to unload some nasty, soul-crushing comments on the students or other faculty, but instead she was just a paper tiger.

2.  While her character was well-sketched, she underwent a complete, unprovoked reversal at the very end that betrayed everything that had gone before.  Quite apart from the fact that that ending could be seen coming from a mile way, the movie hadn't ""earned"" it.  It felt abrupt, felt like they had just done it because her renouncing her big goal abruptly at the end of the movie and starting to love teaching was what was expected by the audience.  But the movie would have been tons more effective and memorable if she stuck it out through the end, got her plastic surgery, and then given everyone the finger at the end of the movie.  It would have been much truer to her character and the nature of the film in general.

In other words, ruined by a Hollywood ending.",1,"[1.14827237169512, 0.22784853931179794, -0.6465418725849148, -1.0310598010597594, -1.4619561761702813]",1.14827237169512

5849,"Wicked Choice is the fourth book in the wildly sexy Wicked Horse Vegas series. I have read every book in this spinoff series and the original series since the beginning. Its just so freaking hot and the storylines are all so different. The one common thing is the Wicked Horse sex clubs. I will make this short since the synopsis explains a lot.

Rachel and Bodie experience one night of passion. Six weeks later their lives are changed forever with one word. Pregnant. Rachel wasn't ready for this kind of commitment. She doesnt want this. But he does. Bodie wants this baby even if Rachel decides to walk away after giving birth. Family is every thing to him. But if thats not what she wants then thats her decision. He isn't upset about it but he doesnt want her to be the one who hurts in the end.

Rachel and Bodie decide that they will have an expiration date on what it is they have. They don't know exactly what it is but they do know that they enjoy the hell out of sex with each other. So why not get to know each other while they have the chance. During this time will Rachel change her mind about how she sees the future? Will the baby go home with her? With Bodie? Or will they all go home together as a family?

Rachel and Bodie have a lot of decisions to make and they are not easy ones. Bodie is so understanding, protective, sexy, and sweet. I just love him. Rachel is used to being on her own so it was nice seeing her cold demeanor melt little by little. Will her wicked nights with Bodie change her mind about raising their child?

Overall...its definitely different than the other books in the series. The subject is more serious. It is still f- sexy as sin though. Damn sexy. At the same time, I cried and I also laughed. I am excited to see who is next up in the series and more about what is happening in the future with The Jameson Group . A group of high security deviousness and smarts.

9371,"I had to see this movie in L.A.  I had to see how a politically-correct crowd of west coasters would react to the onslaught of crude humor in TEAM AMERICA.  There were gasps, but there were a lot of laughs (I saw it in Santa Monica).  The house wasn't full, but I realized that this movie will probably do better when it hits DVD and the stigma of being seen going to it won't be as bad.

Kind of like porn.

Like some of their best stuff, the creators of TEAM AMERICA are very hit and miss.  But when they hit, it's into the stratosphere.

Rarely have I seen a movie that manages to make fun of so many things to so many people.  There's bound to be at least one thing that will offend anyone reading this, but you'll probably have a couple really hard laughs at other scenes.

They've taken the ridiculous medium of puppetry (remember the THUNDERBIRDS from childhood?) to play out a brainless Hollywood action film, but they've also satirized the brainless Hollywood A-list of celebrity/activists (including ""the greatest living actor of all-time, Alec Baldwin"").  The constant barrage of bad language detracted from the overall film--but these are the mind behind ""South Park,"" so there you go.

I have a feeling the film will be more successful as a DVD: everyone's curious to see what was left out the first time around--especially of that notorious puppet sex scene!",3,"[0.1858173140428384, 1.1359383763624864, -0.8741365803499868, -1.038883992197159, -1.0398636595268878]",1.1359383763624864

621,"This should really be a 3.5-star review (which, by the way, is the current ""average"" rating on Amazon as I write this), but Tom Perrotta is a serious writer and I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.

I've never read anything of his before, and I suppose it was the science-fictiony aspect of this book that intrigued me enough to read it.  It's an interesting premise, and Perrotta executes it nicely, with a soupcon of satire/sarcasm for religion and suburbia, among other things.  In the hands of someone like Lionel Shriver, the book would have been far more biting and negative and more of a challenge to get through; I'm grateful to Perrotta for that, because I find each of Ms. Shriver's books harder to take than the last one.  For one thing, even though he pokes fun at just about everyone in the book, he seems to like each of his characters in some way, even if it's just a little bit.  (In contrast, Shriver's books remind me of the old Tom Lehrer lyric ""and I don't like anybody very much"".)  In other words, there's a sweetness to the book that is endearing.

Is it a great novel or great literature?  I don't think so.  Will I read any of his other books now?  I don't feel particularly drawn to them - I've read enough satires of suburban life, religion and so on that I don't feel the need to read more of that.

Melissa Foster has written a book that kept my emotions on a roll from the beginning to the end. It definitely draws on your heart strings while at the same time will twists your emotions all over the place. I was drawn into this book from the very start and could not put it down. It captivated me in a way that no other book has before. In the end you will have your heart strings tugged on, have tears in your eyes along with laughter and smiles. So many emotions put together in one book that causing an emotional overload.

This is a magnificent story told in a spectacular way that you will not forget. This book is so addicting with the twists and turns with a mixture of romance thrown right in the middle of it. There were some twists that I did not see coming at all and then had to smack my head for not realizing it sooner.  You will finish this book with faith and hope in love along with a sense of loyalty and compassion for people that give up everything for family and love.

This was a book that captivated from the beginning to the end; each page I turned and wondered what was going to happen next.

The Nesco racks were filled with the venison cut into strips after preparing with a jerky mix. I was unable to use the mix provided by Nesco since it contains MSG which I and about 10% of the population is allergic to. I was disappointed that Nesco still provides this mix with the Dehydrator since it will make many people get headaches, etc. The dehydrator worked very well and is reasonably quiet and I guess that's what is most important for me. I do like the square shape, it makes sense to me since things like jerky fit into it very well. I plan to try the dehydrator with apples next.

While the storyline is excellent once again, the quality of the writing seems to have dropped off 10% to 20%.  The prologue contained superfluous backstories and used the word ""rankle"" twice within a page and a half.  One rankle per novel, please.

As other readers have noted, some of the grammar and syntax was confusing to the point that some sentence structures were unreadable.  Someone should have proofed this novel a bit more.  You can't blame the author for not seeing all of his own mistakes, but someone should have.

Other than that, it was an enjoyable read and I've moved on to the third novel.  It still has some grammatical issues, but not quite as many as the second novel.

Some of the battle ballistics didn't seem very ""newtonian"", but I read the novel quickly, so they might make sense.  I do believe that the effects of deceleration may have been confused with acceleration.

But, it's worth the read if you like the first novel and the saga continues in a very good fashion into the third novel.

This is one of those standard 'woman has magical powers that she's lived 28 years without noticing, until a man comes along and tells her about them' books. Meanwhile, he controls every aspect of her life while refusing to give her the information she needs to stay safe and chastising her for endangering herself in ways she wasn't told would be dangerous.

And of course these magical powers she's gone 28 years without noticing are ultra powerful and she can defeat well trained, long experienced people without even knowing how. And if that wasn't enough, she's attracted to every man she meets and they all just have to have her too. But of course, she's never noticed she's pretty before.

What's worse, this is a fairly long book, but almost nothing of significant note happens. Then, it ends on a cliffhanger. The whole thing bounces between rushed scenes and long stretches of 'training' or descriptions of what people are wearing.

9471,"I suppose this is how the world looks to an egotistical stoner of limited education.

That's the only way to explain RED STATE, the latest film from Kevin Smith.  A film we won't be seeing at a theatre near you.  A film that doesn't have one believable scene in it.  A film without a single sympathetic character in situations where we might care whether they survive or not.

By calling his film RED STATE and focusing on a sect of religious lunatics, Smith is clearly pandering to the political landscape of Hollywood, picking on the rubes and playing every stereotype he can exploit.  But his writing is still limited and juvenile.  Seasoned FBI Agents talk with the same uneducated dialogue as the stupid, horny teenagers.  Religious zealots end up cursing like stupid, horny teenagers.  In fact, everyone, as usual, ends up talking like Kevin Smith...or how he thinks they should talk while saddled with the vocabulary and thought processess of stupid, horny teenagers.

Unfortunately, Smith ends up equating the FBI with the religious fanatics.  Does Smith honestly believe that phone calls are made from Washington telling Field Agents to slaughter everyone at a hostage situation, including women and children, just to keep things quiet?  What a muddled mess of legal procedures clutter the second half of this movie!

Before watching this film tonight, I saw an article in the press where Smith trashed the Independent Spirit Awards in a profanity-laced tirade via Twitter because RED STATE wasn't nominated for anything.  I'm guessing he's the only one surprised by this.

Never before have I seen someone go so far on so little and still have a career.  And RED STATE will probably never make it out of the red.  Awful.",0,"[1.1008601853396183, -1.6653954692220303, -0.9636670003431017, -1.0457969057915426, -1.2084015649745852]",1.1008601853396183

It was fairly easy to assemble except for the little yellow centers, which kept popping out and flying onto the floor, but once that was taken care of the unit was impressive, looked very nice.

Adding the cylinder, which I had thankfully  filled only 1/3 with sugar syrup, was an unwieldy process, But  I did that over the kitchen sink and once I mastered that and everything was in place, and the feeder was ready to hang on my balcony -- that was when I noticed the syrup dripping out from UNDER the red flowers.

43,"The story centers on an investigation by the NYPD and FBI of a worldwide crime syndicate known as the Midnight Club. The organizations secret membership is made up of powerful financial tycoons and underworld crime bosses. The club is believed to be headed by a Frenchman, Alexandre St. Germain, AKA, The Grave Dancer, who will stop at nothing to ensure his controlling interest in the syndicate.
The Midnight Club is one of more than two dozen James Patterson books that I have read. I rate the Club in the bottom half primarily due to the authors excessive use of rambling, boring and lengthy narration that seems to manifest itself throughout the book. Also the prime characters are never fully developed. Other characters haphazardly float in and out of the story but the reader never gets to really know them. There is also a distinct sense of implausibility and lack of reality to many of the tactical operations undertaken by the NYPD and the FBI.
NYPD Detective John Stefanovitch heads up the investigation into the syndicate. After losing his wife and the use of his legs from actions attributed to the Grave Dancer, Stefanovitch hooks up professionally with a journalist, Sarah McGinniss who just happens to be writing a book about the Midnight Club. She has a young son who figures prominently later in the story. Sarah is a recent divorcee. The professional relationship between McGinniss and Stefanovitch soon turns romantic. But this romance also lacks depth. Midnight Club could have been a great story, but Patterson chose to bring too many characters into the mix without developing any of them in depth.
I rate this book no higher than a 2 on a 5 scale.",1,"[1.0838058662144037, -0.5967767110742014, -1.0202908966767907, -1.0291086405818972, -1.3670671636785072]",1.0838058662144037

Hmmmm. Well, for starters, it's a little to tame for my tastes. I didn't realize it was a YA book and that was my mistake. Not that just because it's a YA book makes it bad, that's not what I'm saying, but it just didn't do it for me. After I realized it was YA I decided to continue to read because, at first, it wasn't too bad. I really liked Quinn and I haven't ever read a vampire book of this nature, so I was intrigued. That quickly changed... First off, she's ""in love"" with Quinn, her watcher and childhood friend, and then Damien shows up and her love for Quinn is write off as bloodlust from feeding from him and now she's in love with Damien... and to tip it off, even thought he was ""in love"" with her as well, Quinn is ok with it. In fact, they don't even really acknowledge the fact that they were so in love one minute and then not the next. Weird. There was much action but not really any build up and it was over before it really started. Everything that happens in this book seems rushed and not very descriptive.

Unfortunately there is more than a bit of dross (i.e., use Wikipedia/just be careful!) Really?  Does the author believe the public credits it as unimpeachable?  Part of the problem too is the tone, which is sometimes scolding. More annoying still is author's apparent belief that all errors are equally egregious.  Sorry, but I can't get terribly agitated if a bowl features a few fruits from different seasons.  No doubt farmers will be outraged but I am not one of them.

As the bloopers pile up Allenyn seems more pedant than scholar and a few times I wondered if her sole purpose in reading was to catch others' mistakes.  My biggest problem with historical fiction today is a seeming ubiquitous presence of ""presentism"", wherein characters from centuries past are portrayed with modern sensibilities.  Drives me up a wall.  It is discussed in Medieival Underpants but is also given short shrift--perhaps half dozen pages. Why discuss or explore appropriate emotional or mental states when you can catalog ""gotcha moments""  like pointing out cotton britches that should have been made of linen or wool.

This book touched every single emotion I could possibly have. I cried, I worried, I smiled, I held my breath, I felt compassion. Most of all this book felt real. It was not a book that when something happened i didn't question it, it just felt right. This book was beautiful.

OMG..Rory, that girl is so strong. My heart fell out of my chest for her. I could not believe what she was going through. I felt this girls pain, this girls journey. I cheered for her while she conquered her demons. I wanted to hug her when she couldn't fight back, when she felt hopeless. One main reason this book was so great is that I completely forgot I was reading and was totally immersed into the story. I could not devour it quick enough.

I love Sam, he maybe one of my favorite book boys!! The way he fought for Rory, the way he protected her, the way he loved her it was so amazing to watch (read)! I'm not giving up on these two... not one second, they are just two incredible fighters.

This book was everything a great book should be, it was captivated the whole time. Yes, I am left hanging, but I can not wait till the next book publishes. I will most likely devour it as well...

Yes, it's a hot erotic story. Unfortunately the story is too big for the main character, Nonnie, who recently divorced has NEVER had any experience in BDSM, nor even fantasies about it the way the book reads. I found that quite unbelievable as she ends up in not one, but two scenes with different Doms with completely different styles. No. This story didn't do it for me... so many inconsistencies with what a real life woman would be like. Really? You meet up with some young gal at a bar where you met The Businessman, and leave this bar with her to go to a BDSM club? Just like that? NO!

3 stars because the eroticism of the scenes was really rather delicious, but that's all I'm rating it for.

Happily ever after does not come easy for these two and this book really delivers some hard times for these two. This book put my heart through the ringer! All I wanted was for these two to work it all out. In the end though Greetings From Sugartown delivered everything I wanted and gave us the conclusion Ana and Elijah deserved.

Elijah and I got off to a rocky start, but he has really won me over. He is so hard on the outside but he is really a big old romantic softie underneath it all. He really made my heart melt in this one. He doesnt always say the right thing or act the way I would really like, but at the end of it all I do love him and he has wormed his way into my heart. Then there is Ana who I simply love. That girl is made of steel and I just love how strong she is! I don't think there is anything that can stop her from getting what she wants.

The story will really keep you on the edge of your seat dying to see where it is going next. Honestly, this one will probably surprise you and it sure surprised me (in the best way of course). This was nothing like I was expecting but still everything I wanted, if that makes any sense. Not only do we see Ana and Elijah work through their ups and downs, but there is a whole different and more suspenseful side to the story. The combinations of these two elements just made it incredibly enjoyable. And of course there are some seriously delicious scenes throughout the book.

1478,"I have read (and loved) every single Fannie Flagg book ever published, and it pains me to give one of her books only 3 stars, but I just did not care for this book nearly as much as her previous novels. I think the main thing that turned me off was not understanding why exactly Margaret wanted to commit suicide in the first place. Because she's no longer Miss Alabama? Because she had an affair with a married man 40 years ago? Because she didn't marry her teenage sweetheart? All pretty weak reasons to drown yourself in a lake.

Another issue for me was how neat and clean everything was wrapped up. I realize all Fannie's novels have happy endings, and I look forward to that, but in this book it just felt forced and extremely far-fetched. Especially the surprise at the end. Funny how that all worked out. And I KNEW Babs would end up getting hers in the end, but it was all so rushed. Just a paragraph explained her downfall.

Also, while I liked Margaret, I certainly didn't love her. She was much more likeable though when compared to her 'friends' (with the exception of Hazel). Every time Margaret tried to broach the topic of cluing Brenda into her suicide plans, she would always ignore Margaret's silent plea and turn the conversation to herself. I thought it was extremely selfish and it really made me not like her.

Overall, I just did not love this book. It's been 4 years since Fannie's published a book, and this is the first time I've ever been disappointed with one of her novels. She's still (and probably always will be) my absolute favorite author ever, but this just didn't feel like the Fannie I know and love.

I hate to give top rating to a book with crude sexual remarks and scenes in addition with some profanity, but this was truly a well-written book with a great story. Of course I cannot share it with my family and friends because of embarrassment. It was so good I could barely put it down. It is a shame good writers cannot see their talents and literary abilities is great enough they do not have to muddy the story up with sexual explicitness or outward profanity.
This is a tender story of a woman becoming a 'mail order bride'after losing her only child. She wasn't totally honest in her letters and had 'friends' write her references to become the man's bride and mother to his children. She couldn't tell him she had been raised in a saloon and her mother was one of the 'working' girls. She had not chosen that life for herself and only wanted out of there. Things seemed OK at first but her past seemed to keep getting in her way. She didn't think she could ever love again nor bear another man to touch her.

You meet Wesley and Mac in the first book of the series Running Into Love since that one stars Fawn (Mac's sister) and Levi (Wesley's partner). You feel the magnetic chemistry between Wesley and Mac from the start. Oh my God does Wesley make my heart swoon. He's hot and protective. Mac i love her stubborn ways and her big heart. Seriously when you read Stumbling Into Love how can you not just fall in love with Wesley and Mackenzie. Oh lets not forget the ever loveable Reed family. I love the banter between the sisters and Katie their mother. You add in Miss Ina into the mix and you can't help but busting out laughing. I loved every minute of the book. I couldn't put it down. I so can't wait for Libby's book and see what antics she gets into and more of the Reed family. This is a fantastic series so far and just keeps getting better.

I wasn't what I expected. I always like a hero to be kind to heroine. Even he was broken but I expected him to treat her well. I found myself irritated of how Tony treated Claire. I also didn't understand the Rawls chapter but wonder if it related. Until I read a chapter where it said that it was 1977 then I pieced the hints and guessed that it was Anthony's past.

All I hoped for was Tony did truly love Claire. I could continue read the book as long as I could hold on to that hope. All he did was a consequence of some actions but if he did love her, everything would be fine.

Until I finished the book I know all the reason of his action. The epilogue made me sad because I didn't want a story where it included 2 females and 1 male. I want to believe Tony would receive his consequences of his actions. I didn't want him to continue his revenge with another girl. I planned to read another book before I purchase the second book. I don't want to read it right away because this book left me exhausted. Not that it wasn't well written, but I've never read this kind of storyline before. Everything was well planned. It was just that it left me exhausted and devastated.

I started to believe that all the accidents weren't an accident. As well as Simon's internship wasn't a coincident; the layout, everything. At least I hope Courtney's friendship was real. I really need that.

I really what to know if Tony really loved Claire. The man must be misery. Even he did truly love her; he loved his grandfather more. How could he did that to her. The accident that almost caused her life, was it accident or intention. If she decided to leave him after he let her choose, what would happen? Maybe she would get another accident and truly dead this time? I hope not.

I was intrigued if Claire's going to get her revenge. After this I wonder how she could love him knowing what he was doing to not just her but everyone around her.",3,"[1.0045522481317835, -0.5439757379764385, -0.31224788896120614, -1.0313596663595113, -1.2966405721874188]",1.0045522481317835
153,"I did not expect to like this book at all. From descriptions I had read, I expected it would be similar to Post Office by Charles Bukowski, which I hated, because it seemed to glorify and justify addictions. Besides, that one was not even very well written, in my opinion. But then a friend whose literary opinions I trust said Jesus' Son was ""beautiful,"" so I decided to give it a chance.

And it is beautiful. And powerful. And brutally humorous. And about the saddest book I have ever read.

In a series of very short stories, Johnson gives us a look into the hallucinatory world of a heroin and alcohol addict, and, believe me, it is not a nice place to be. The narrator seems (figuratively) to be lost in a terrifying carnival fun house with no idea how to get out, not sure of what is real and what is not any more, and having perhaps even lost memory of the ""real"" world. The ending story does give some sense of hope, even though the narrator has been perhaps irreparably damaged.

The writing combines grittiness and poetry, with the contrast making each more powerful.

This would not be a book that all would like. It is very intense and not very cheerful. It's good that it is short, because I, for one, could have not have been immersed in that world for too long without extreme discomfort. But it is, indeed, beautiful.",3,"[1.0033265595349512, 0.5813925884856337, -0.3231484509904462, -1.0236422199354205, -1.583848253459144]",1.0033265595349512

7852,"I received this product free for a review.

Well, it's no wonder I had trouble loosing weight when I was trying to use portion control.  This scale taught me very quickly that my eye-balling estimates and the actual portion sizes I was eating had very little in common.  When a sample of this scale was offered to me in exchange for a review my first thought was that I would finally be able to make those artisan breads I've salivated over in magazines and cookbooks.  Naturally when the scale arrived I didn't have any fresh flour or yeast in the house so could not make any bread right away.  I could measure out a 4 ounce serving of chicken -- which began as an 8 ounce serving with me slicing away one bit after another until I got to the actual correct amount.  I had been sooo wrong!  Fortunately (?) now I have no excuse for being wrong any more.  With the wonderful bowl that came with the scale it is easy to even weigh things like a portion size of lasagna or even fruit and see the numbers displayed clearly.  Plus, the scale is so attractive that I leave it out on the counter instead of storing it away.  Now I'm actually using it.

I finally got the ingredients I needed for the bread and used the scale to measure everything out.  It slowed me down just a little to use something other than cups for measuring, but this little scale works wonders and I've already gotten faster at using it.  I like that I can put my own bowl on the platform, re-calibrate the scale, then measure my flour into my bowl.  The bread is working out well and my only problem now is limiting myself to how much I make.  Remember the chicken I had to weigh out?  Well, bread is one of the main reasons for that little exercise.",3,"[0.9997277087015658, 0.021700723580229786, -0.6206539886054682, -0.9757547489859607, -1.7456095662221376]",0.9997277087015658

7460,"I own an iMac that has 4 USB ports in the back. Now that I own an iPad, an iPod Touch, a Kindle, a computer back-up hard drive, etc., the 4 ports were insufficient for my needs. After reading the description for this product, it seemed to be ideal for use with a laptop computer. Since it doesn't come with an AC cord, I was afraid that it wouldn't be adequate for the devices that I intended to use it for. I was wrong.

After removing it from the box, I simply detached one of the devices that was plugged into the back of my Mac and plugged this unit in. I than plugged the device I had removed into this unit, along with 3 other devices that use a USB port. To my surprise, everything works perfectly, even when many devices are being used at the same time. I'm able to use my printer, my keyboard, my back-up hard drive, my Kindle, my iPad, my iPad Touch, etc., all with no loss in signal strength whatsoever. This tiny little USB hub sits behind my computer and just dangles from one of the USB ports. The cable is very short, but due to it's extremely light weight, there's no problem with it becoming detached.

The only thing I don't care for on the hub, is the red light that constantly shines. This is a personal issue and has nothing to do with the quality of the hub. I'm just one of those people who doesn't care for red lights. If it came with a blue light, I'd be happier. Obviously, this is not a big deal, and has no effect on the wonderful performance of the hub.

The bottom line is that this hub works better than I had expected. It completely solved my problem of not having enough USB ports. It did so in such an unobtrusive way, that I hardly notice that the unit is even there.

While not, in my opinion, as good as Black Cross, Mortal Fear and The Quiet Game, Dead Sleep is very much worth reading. In typical fashion, Iles has developed an imaginative story, multidimensional characters, a very fast-paced plot and non-stop surprises. Unlike James Patterson in his book, First To Die, Iles has created a female protagonist that is very credible, strong and one you grow very fond of and really care about. I came close to giving Dead Sleep a 5-star rating; but didn't because the ending, while enjoyable, was a bit contrived. This, however, is a minor flaw, at most, and should not deter you from reading this book. As a matter of fact, if you haven't already done so, you should read all of Iles' books. While all thrillers, they are all very different from each other. What they have in common is a creator who is extremely talented. In just a few years, Iles has established hinself as an author whose books I make it a point to buy just because he wrote them. What the story is about is almost inconsequential because I have confidence, based on past experience, that it will be a real page-turner.

6196,""" I see ye, Bree. I see all of ye. Don't hide from me.""

Sigh, So many sighs
* As I dramatically lay back on the sofa clutching my Kindle *

Santa brought me an early present this year! No exaggeration when I say I have been overly anxious to get my eyeballs on Owen's story! These Irish rock gods are some of my absolute favorites- and Owens grumpy, stoic, depressive, parental but all-sexy beast nature has made him one of my favorites- I needed to see him get an HEA. ( Does anyone know if there are support groups for situations like this? eh.. )
WOAH.
My emotions were all over the place! I love it when a novel gives me goosebumps and butterflies!
Seriously folks-
Holy fictional slayer of words this book Did. Not. Disappoint. !!!
In fact, it exceeded my expectations in the intense emotionally dark storms that brew beneath the surface for Bree and Owens need to find out why then try to save her from it. Can we say #Swoon. Bringing them together in ways the others in the close-knit family cannot, making the union between them even more of a special spark inducing bond.
The story catapults you into a world of lost friendships, family ties, trying to regain one's self and what happens when you are in with the Gallagher family.
A funny, smack the forehead ( I swear I did at least 4 or 5 times, *Owen I mean really*) hotter than Hades, sparks a flying, stubborn male- protector filled ride, but one you want to be on!
I am such a fan of the Wild Irish books!
I highly suggest checking out; it is more than meets the eye.

4777,"I have been looking forward to reading Drop Dead Sexy for a while now.  The synopsis was cute and quirky and made me smile.

Now that I have finished it, I liked it, but I didn't love it.

I absolutely adored the first 30%. I laughed out loud, couldn't get enough of our leading lady Olivia.  I loved that she didn't have the run of the mill job, that her relationships had literally been killer.  I loved she was pulling up her big girls pants and was putting herself out there again.

Then she met Holden ""Catcher"" Mains - and for me it just started to lose it's oomph for me.

I adored the sexy GBI Agent Mains, I did.  But there was just something about them together that... just didn't do it for me.

Their relationship just didn't really gel with me. It may be just a case of ""it's not you book, it's me"" with this one.

After the first hook up, it kind of fell away, and I found it hard to keep up the level of interest I had in the book that I had for the first 30%

Maybe it was just that there was so much going on around them that it took away from Olivia and Catcher?  There were so many secondary characters coming into the story and becoming part of their story that I became disconnected to them.

Like I said, this really could just be me, and you might absolutely love this to death.  I wanted to love it, but just liked it.  Which I hated :(",3,"[0.9789547352471047, 0.07059389991442155, -0.5061132639614825, -1.0125271601590813, -1.1705270164042179]",0.9789547352471047

The characterization was terribly weak and the plot was a hodge-podge that was, so often, not credible.  The blurb on this book states that Kyle is a 14-year-old when his father dies and the story takes place 12 years later.  The opposite is true, however--Kyle was 12 when his father ""died"" and the story takes place fourteen years later.
Kyle's ""father"" is never developed in a credible way and the dialog attributed to him is quite lame.  In fact, most of the dialog in the novel is contrived and unbelieveable.
The plot takes twists and turns that are almost suspenseful one or two times but fall flat the remainder.  I was not familiar with this author and the ""New York Times Bestselling Author"" on the cover definitely got my attention.  After reading the book, however, I would steer clear of other Lashner books.
I would recommend passing on this one. Random + poor dialog = DON'T BOTHER! Additionally, the syntax was really inventive and, um...annoying.

Most will agree with me that these movies are epic and that J.R.R. Tolken was a genius. Once you go to ""Middle Earth"" you may never want to return.  However, I am not reviewing the movie but rather the aforementioned product.  I assume based on reading some of the reviews that the low rating for this product must result from the fact that Amazon has erroneously lumped in the reviews for products other than the aforementioned.

I own the theatrical version of this trilogy on DVD.  However, I have always wanted the extended edition in blue-ray.  I finally purchased recently and received on 4/24/14.  The shipping time was excellent and I received in only 3 days.  The set was 44.96 when I purchased (shipping was free) which I consider a bargain.  It's currently 89.96 at Walmart plus you have to pay sale taxes.

The picture and audio quality is simply outstanding.  I don't even have an enhanced auto system and the sound is still amazing.  On my LG HD TV, the picture is so crisp, sharp and vivid that it seems like I could reach out and touch the actors and the scenery. Each movie contains 5 disc: 2 for the extended version of the movie and 3 of the appendices.  Each movies contains approximately 30 to 60 minutes of additional scenes.  The extra footage adds additional information from the book, ""has real story value"" ( to use PJ's words during the commentary from the Hobbit: AUJ) and adds additional depth to the story/movie, as well as adding to the experience of watching such an amazing Saga that anyone fan, whether ""die hard"" or not will find this product exciting and well worth owning.

I liked the small town characters (although there were around 70 of them!). The magical realism of ""evie"" without explanation was too much for me. Where did she come from? Why did she do this experiment or why was she ""called"" to do this? Why a tiger, a peacock, snake and a fox and a magic tree? Some must be allusions to the garden of eve, but without context, I kept waiting to find out why, how,etc. but it never materialized. Also, normally in a SK book, there is a ton of suspense and it's a real page turner. This one I would say is evenly paced. There were some sections with some suspense, but nowhere near what you would expect. Bottom line: it was interesting how the father/son duo felt the world would cope with the genders isolated.

Willow struggles with her self worth and a 'family' that viciously feeds those insecurities. Her situation broke my heart, but the growth that followed gave me the warm and fuzzies. This book shows how determination and the love of others can give you the drive to overcome the inner battles we all face from time to time.

Kane... I struggled to find another word to describe him other than perfect. Because if this book teaches us anything at all, it's that no one is perfect. He's loyal, caring, gentle, patient, supportive, determined, and one of the most swoon worthy characters I have read in a long time. I love him, I'm going to keep him, and I'm going to make him mine forever....

I loved this story, and I know that you will to.

The reason for the 4 stars is that the bottle has many lines and patterns which make it difficult to tell the level of the sugar water. It's hard to know when it needs filling. We have always had a problem with wasps around the feeder. They seem to congregate at the underside of the feeder and sometimes even chase the birds away. I have two feeders, the old one is a Homestead brand, all plastic, yellow ""flowers"" and red base and the one I am reviewing, the Perky-Pet.(what a weird name)Apparently the Homestead either leaks slightly or the act of the birds getting the sugar water allows sugar water to seep around the unit collecting at the bottom. This is what draws the wasps. So far over the last two weeks this has not been a problem with the Perky-Pet. I am hopeful the better design of this unit is preventing the wasp problem.",3,"[0.9538250929452458, 0.1697920824488004, -0.6265120361940761, -1.0057470998506166, -1.860804917484092]",0.9538250929452458

Though, later I read the authors' other works and liked them. Also I was wondering why this series has quite a high rating so I decided to give it another try.

It took me quite a while to finished this one. The writing style still distracted me from the story. The storyline was interesting. I had forgot a lot of it. I can't remember whether she revealed who she was in the first book. So I didn't know who was her sire. But if Morrigan didn't want to cross with her, I figure she must be really powerful.

The first book had almost zero romance. This second book was almost the same. It was a little slow for my taste but the adventure was interesting enough. That little romance they had, which leading into something more in the future, was really cute. I like shapeshifters mating aspect. Feeding the person they're interested in was quite endearing. As I said, it was slow for my taste, but I prefer this over insta-love.

All in all, I enjoy it and I've already purchased the rest of the series. I'd be a really happy reader having all of the books to read at once.

This book was not at all what I was expecting. It completely messed with my head!! There were times when I was thinking to myself whatl am I reading but I couldn't put it down.

The one thing I completely hated about this book was the way the men referred to women! I couldn't stand the way they called every woman b! tch! I understand their an MC but it just rubbed me the wrong way.

Mae escaped from the commune she has been raised in, it was horrendous and my heart broke for her and also all the people who are actually living in that he!! right at this moment! Mae was completely sheltered of the outside life and she struggled to come to terms with everything about living with the Hades Hangmen! There were a few times at the beginning of this book I found Mae hard to connect to but the more into the book I got the more I started liking her character.

Styks was a complete jerk for a lot of this story and I swear I was so annoyed at him I just wanted to slap and scream at him for the stupid things he had done. I hated the fact Styks struggled with his speech, I just wanted Mae to be able to fix that for him but nothing is ever as simple as that!

This book was filled with complete devastation, lust, anger, fear and probably every other emotion under the sun!

The book emphasized Fancy wanting a ""forever thing"". I was never really sure what that meant to her. It seemed like love and commitment were not enough.  Theron felt like he would never again make a long term commitment. There was an HEA, but it took an interesting path.

I did feel chemistry between Theron and Fancy at the beginning, but it was not strong. It developed over time. They argued a lot and jumped to conclusions, which was irritating.  The grandmother was an awfully selfish person

I ended up thinking of this book like white noise interspersed with little bursts of sound. Those bursts were Theron's daughter, Echo; the beauty salon ladies; and Sophie and Kate.

I don't know the size of this town, but Theron held 3 or 4 jobs. Deputy, school principal, deacon, and rancher.  This took something away from the book for me.

9292,"Today's movie was ""Wild Wild West"" starring Will Smith and Kevin Kline. Well, it's somewhat hard to even consider this oddity a movie. If someone asked me what the plot was all about, for example, I'd be hard pressed to give a coherent answer. The main character's name is West and it takes place in the western U. S., more or less, in about the mid-1800s. Rather than consider it a story, I'd have to regard it as about 90 minutes of assorted absurdities. Some are humorous. Following the story, if there is one, is nearly impossible, but if you want to watch it for odd jokes, strange lines, visual puns and widely assorted gadgetry, it's actually  amusing. enjoyable and entertaining. The gadgets, in particular, are rather clever and some of them are hilariously funny. How Hollywood ever puts these things together are beyond my understanding. And it obviously had to have major funding. The acting wasn't bad if you can get by with the absurdity. The filming and soundtrack are excellent. The story? Well, it's funny too, but in a moronic way. I'd say watch it if you have a taste for really odd comedies or if you're a gadget lover. Otherwise, you're probably going to find it a waste of time.

These are by far the worst headphones I've ever heard. I compared them to my ten year old son's $30 Skull Candy and was blown away. Now Skull Candies are not, in my opinion, Sennheiusers or Boschs but they made the Sony's appear tinny and remote by comparison.

I loved the raw, electric chemistry between Elec and Greta. Their feelings for each other was all consuming, intense and complex. My heart broke when fate constantly intervened to keep these two soul mates apart. It. Broke. Me. I found reading part two of this book gut wrenching and absolutely heart breaking!

What a gorgeous hard cover book."" and even now with the second book in my hands - I am still amazed at the quality of this book!

This is not your typical journal where you have a blank page with lines (or without lines) and you have to come up with something to write. Those are fine for some people, and even for some of the time. But for those of us, like me! who never know what to write and need a head start, these books are perfect!
Each page gives you suggestions of what to write, some drawings to color or doodle on, and some prayers, Bible verses etc.

This is really such a great idea for a journaling series - so much fun and room for some creativity. I just love these books!

And... With our first Grandbaby on the way!!! Yes, I just said that! Our only daughter is pregnant with their first - a girl! I am thinking that these would be great to do with your child or grandchild!

909,"What should have been a gripping thriller was dull dull dull.  The idea of the story sounds fantastic.  The author did a poor job executing it.  I didn't care about a single character.  None.  Throughout the entire book I just didn't care about their issues, love life, problems whatever.  The author can't write well enough to make me care.  So Mom is kidnapped. Daughter is distraught.  I don't really care about the daughter.  Next we meet Mom who is being tortured.  How I can listen to a person being tortured & have no feelings about it other than boredom is beyond me.  There are no emotions.  Nothing gripping.  It just isn't there.  Another character, the poor tortured soul good guy (who apparently is sexy though I never felt the sexy).  Then we have our scary bad ass bad guys - um right.  Not scary.  I don't worry about Mom, daughter or anyone else while they deal with these so called bad ass criminals; not the cops, not the neighbors, not the kids, nobody.

Then the grand finale!  The explanation behind EVERYTHING!  I just didn't care.  So that's why this that & the other thing happened.  That's nice.  So what.  Are we done yet?  I was happy when it ended & I will likely never listen to the book again.  Nor do I have intentions of bothering with any more of Karin Slaughters novels.

51,"""The Art of Racing in the Rain"" reads like an earnest student's best effort in a creative writing program:  The writing is polished and grammatically correct, but it lacks rhythm and soul.  Writing from the perspective of a dog also rings false, disingenuous, and silly -- somehow the dog narrator has emotional maturity and the intelligence to string together a novel yet he's constrained into acting like a dog all the time?

The ending is emotionally charged, and that's the highlight of this novel.  But the way over there was stilted and boring, as were the characters themselves.  We cared little for the characters, although we grieved for their tragic lives.  But perhaps the plot was much too contrived and manipulative?",2,"[0.9010003867928783, 0.6481351385022549, -0.14714908809239557, -1.0476984385995294, -1.5131727608678136]",0.9010003867928783

1391,"I never wanted to give up on this book, so that's a point in its favor. I wanted to know whodunit and why, and how all the characters ended up. BUT I agree with other reviewers that it was too long, that the computer aspects of the plot were implausible, and that certain actions of the characters involved didn't seem fully motivated, i.e. some of the twists in the plot seemed too based on chance. On the other hand, the psychology of each character is pretty well fleshed out, and I applaud Turow trying to represent some growth and change in the main characters, particularly the PA, Tommy Molto. I liked the way the nemesis relationship between Tommy and Rusty played out, and the fine line it walked between respect and disdain. I also didn't mind Nat, Rusty's son, the way some reviewers apparently did - he seemed a reasonable outcome of the type of parents he had.

So a decent, but not great, recreational read, in my view. But much more about unearthing the psychology of each character than truly creating suspense through both psychology and plot.",2,"[0.898197001478218, -0.15642182528535242, -0.32514152840883526, -0.9961586140286395, -2.2272368229890764]",0.898197001478218

3042,"This story had one of the worst beginnings of any book that I have ever read. It was very odd in the sense that the introduction started off with an unknown woman discussing her relationship with what I assume was a therapist. The ramblings were I think meant to be like something of stressful or perhaps even shock but it was all over the place. The conversation was rushing back and forth between the two parties involved and honestly I would not have any idea what was involved had I not read the book blurb. Overall this book was a complete fail.

I can't help but to be extremely disappointed with the outcome of this book. Judging by the synopsis I thought this going to be a fun romance about a dragon hero and the woman that falls in love with the hero for both the monster and the man that he was. There was hardly any romance in this book and Kostya was completely outshined by the childish-like antics of Aoife, the heroine.

As for the romance it was absent in every sense minus the conversations and the memories of the heroine discussing her former relationship. The plot was dried out-like the author didn't know the direction that she wanted to take both the books and the characters.

 I want to include that this book was extremely difficult to push through into reading it. It was not a book that I wanted to finish.

I am so in love with this series, and Im seriously in love with Ryder Brooks. Theres just something about a bad boy, especially when he isn't nearly as bad as he pretends to be. He doesnt want to care about people, about Mia, but its very obvious that he does. He cares what people think. What Mia and the guys think. Their opinions matter to him, even if he pretends they dont, which is what makes Ryder so endearing to me. Hes a bad boy with a poets heart that he does his best to hide.

One of my favorite things about this book is the fake/pretend relationship aspect. Ryder needs to get his G.E.D. to save face in front of the rest of the band, and the world, because he lied and led everyone to believe he has his high school diploma, and he doesnt. Instead, he has plans to take his G.E.D. in a month and he got the bands tour manager to find him a tutor. Who he finds is smart, straight-laced, far too interesting and tempting, Mia.

Mia is a somewhat sheltered girl, a secret Seconds to Juliet fangirl, who had a little bit of a crush on Ryder, before she met him and found out what a jerk he is. Still, she agrees to be his pretend girlfriend so he can save face in front of the rest of the guys, but she wasn't expecting to find depth beneath his bad boy exterior, depth she actually begins to like.

If you are a boy band fangirl at heart, do yourself a favor and buy this book. Its so good. So fun and heartfelt. And so very well-written. I couldn't put it down!",4,"[0.8866262220555202, -0.5945399077504312, -0.9278805648784222, -1.0021329886419748, -1.4795771556111705]",0.8866262220555202

You understand the fears of Lennon wanting to start relationship just as they all graduated. But once the Grad night commences and the mayhem that follows Jade and Lennon's night you just hope he finally just jumps. After 4 years of fighting his feeling for Jade I love how it all goes down. I love how you get a little bit of Fynn and Bray in this one too. These friends are amazingly supportive of each other. I laughed out loud with this one and got the awe feeling along the way.

Picking up where book 1 left off, Santana's past is told in several flashbacks interspersed throughout the story. There is so much more to the sweet girl we met in book 1 than I would have guessed. She had led such a tragic life before Maddox took her in. He saved her and in some ways, she saved him too.

Santana's feelings for Maddox, and his for her, are apparent to everyone except the two of them it seems. Finally, they clue in and the rest is history, more or less. Then, the secret that Maddox has kept from her is brought to light and the s**t hits the fan...but don't blink or you might miss it!

The speed and ease with which Santana decided to forgive and forget Maddox's missteps made me question whether I was more upset than she was! The same was true for Ash in book 1. For such strong women, they certainly lose their fight quickly! I want to see them make these guys work for it! Instead, they get a halfhearted apology and they cave. What's worse is that every time Maddox screwed up royally, or was acting like a jerk, it was portrayed as Santana's fault. About half the time SHE actually ended up apologizing for causing his behavior!

Overall, I thought the story was good and I liked it. My dislikes are pretty similar to my gripes about book1. Ms. Jewel does a wonderful job of building anticipation, but when the ""big event"" finally occurs, it feels anticlimactic. I have been left feeling a bit let down more than once in this series. Seriously! Major conflicts between the H/h should not be resolved with a simple conversation or two covered in a few pages of content, when 1/2 the book was leading up to that moment.

I don't think this book is a 3.
Why? It seemed to drag on & on with no end in sight! Oh. My. God!
I was getting bored.

Faye is seriously messed up in the head. The games she played, she took everything too far. I wanted to believe it was because it happened to her, but she just got off on her own sick perversion.
She kept saying how beautiful it is to look inside ones poo hole, seeing one crying because it hurts is beautiful, I just didn't get it. Faye would get in these evil moods once she had control, and things would turn sinister almost, without the others permission, using the excuse, ""it's freeing"" .

I don't get the getting off on blood & pain ( and other stuff I can't say ) It was not BDSM, it was just sick. Nasty sick. Why do people think its such a turn on to lick, suck and drink the waste the we expel from our bodies? For pleasure? No.
It's just wrong! I don't get the whole drinking other people's pee, but what is just insanely sick is... I'll stop there. That is not a turn on!!
Plus, pulling my hair out!
I was tired of all the fighting, it just went on and on. Faye is a runner & is the one always crying poor me, just wanted to slap her! But she would have liked it! LOL

It is NOT a standalone though, so if you haven't read part 1, be sure to read that first.  I like these two characters and I enjoyed the tortuous path they are going down, even though Layla's insecurities near the end are a bit much  (don't want to put in spoilers) and the plot, which had been interesting and different up to the 75% mark suddenly became a bit too ""traditional"" :  the author used plot devices which were old and overused, but still I was willing to overlook that because I liked the characters.  I wasn't able to read this book in one sitting and I was found myself thinking about these two and wondering where the author would take us next.  That in and of itself is a feat but it made the sudden series of cliches at the end a bit more of a let down.
That said, I do wish romance authors would quit writing books in installments.  If I had come across these books before the trilogy was complete I would never have finished them (or bought them.)  There is too much to read out there, we are not in the age of Dickens when installments--and waiting for them to come out -- were the way to go.  There was much less competition in the bookstores then.  If too much time passes between installments I forget the characters and by the time the next one comes out I've forgotten the characters, am no longer empathizing with their emotions and just don't care anymore.  A few romance authors have tried this format and I am NOT a fan and strictly stay away from them.
