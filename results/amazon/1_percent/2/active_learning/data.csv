936,"This novel is the closing book in the quartet that Mr. Shaara wrote about the largely ignored (at least in historical fiction) western theater of the American Civil War. I believe that the series is worth your time to read if you have a preexisting interest in the subject.
The Fateful Lightning is really General Shermans book. It begins with his leaving Atlanta after its capture and concludes with the surrender of Joe Johnstons army in late April of 1865. Per his usual style, the book is written in alternating viewpoints from a few character's point of view. Each chapter is a first person account from its narrator. Other than William T. Sherman, no other character really registers consistently in the novel. I think that General Sherman is one of the better characters (in terms of how he is written) that Mr. Shaara has created so I did not mind this.
A quibble with the text, Mr. Shaara clearly cannot write woman characters. When they show up and speak it is not very authentic or interesting. Oddly enough, the second book in this series did have a compelling female character as one of its alternating narrators. Not sure what happened here?
There are also a few moments where slavery appears to be whitewashed, but stick with it. The evil of slavery is not whitewashed at all; Mr. Shaara is just presenting it in its historical context without judging. I appreciated that approach. It speaks for itself, and the author does not (and did not) have to condemn it in modern terms. As the novel progresses, it clearly condemns itself.
The book bears out the enormity of the Civil War with an unexpected subtlety in its final chapters that is quite good. It is appropriate and well done.
Overall, the books in this series are not great. They are good, at times very good, and I read them all quickly. I am glad that I did.",3,"[-2.938870213336613, -0.8751134204907175, -0.8668878885801592, -0.9983863989200072, -1.1769204675659548]",-0.8668878885801592

793,"This novel explores the vulnerable imagination of thirteen-year-old girls still clinging to innocence but on the verge of the knowledge the world bestows, stripping away the fragile cocoon of childhood, where magic is still possible, but demons lurk in the darkness. Best friends and neighbors, Lizzie Hood and Evie Verver share everything until the summer before high school in their Midwestern suburban community when Evie disappears. Refusing to relinquish Evie to the terrors that the adults have already assumed, Lizzie clings to hope, drawn to Evie's family and the unfolding emotional drama of a handsome, loving father, a goddess-like older sister and a ghostly mother, even more insubstantial since Evie's disappearance. Lizzie desperately wants to help as she slides smoothly into Evie's environment, dredging up memories, searching for clues the police might have missed. A girl in crisis who cannot find traction in her own fatherless home, Lizzie is lost without Evie- and the family that has welcomed her throughout childhood.

While Abbott captures the intimacy of friendship and the often unreliable impulses of young girls' hearts, the beat of disquiet thrums, secrets bloom in the dark and emotions collide even before Evie's disappearance. The shining family, repository of Lizzie's happiest memories, shatters more the further she is drawn into an emotional vortex beyond her ken, both rapturous and vulnerable as her discoveries aid the search for Evie. This novel bridges the chasm between childhood and reality, Lizzie vaguely conscious of what she knows but cannot bear to acknowledge. This tough novel is filled with horrors, perhaps too slight to bear the weight of its terrible revelations, the truths that fill the shadowy places of the Verver's home. Vacillating between seduction and brutal frankness, Abbott holds a mirror up to society's faade, Sleeping Beauty staring into the eyes of evil, poison apple staining her lips.

It wasn't easy to get to the relationship stage and it won't be easy to remain.
Both have a past. Brody comes face to face with his past while Delilah doesn't quite know how to begin again. Their situations gave us a deeper understanding of the characters.

2087,"I've been included in another September Blog tour with Revell Books, a division of Baker Publishing Group folks! Today's post is on Justice Buried: A Memphis Cold Case Novel by Patricia Bradley. It's book #2 in the Memphis Cold Case series, but the story itself was definitely of standalone quality. (I can say that since I haven't read book #1 yet.) I have read other Patricia Bradley books - they were in the Logan Point series.

The main female character in this series is Kelsey Allen, a woman who has been very careful in guarding her heart for years because of her past. As Kelsey's story is revealed, her father disappeared decades ago and was suspected to have been involved in a robbery at a Memphis museum when artifacts went missing. Kelsey is in the process of building her security consulting business and is hired at the same museum to go undercover and pose as a curator. Due to the fact that Kelsey's mother married a man who adopted Kelsey when she was young, she has a different last name than her biological father, so no one knows her true identity.

Her undercover job suddenly leads into a murder investigation, and soon everything becomes tied to the cold case of Kelsey's father's disappearance. This leads Kelsey to the realization that she will need to get the assistance of the police in order to solve the mystery. Detective Brad Hollister, a homicide detective from Kelseys past recently assigned to cold cases, so it's no surprise they had romantic sparks flying.

I really thought plot was great and my only regret was that I hadn't read the first book. I loved that I kept thinking there were several different characters who could have been the suspect for this crime, and I had no idea until I was probably through 3/4ths of the book. It kept me on my toes and kept me guessing. It wasn't easy to figure out or see where the story was going, and there were even a few surprises along the way that I didn't see coming.

3100,"I'd seen this book around the blogosphere and thought the premise sounded interesting - what would you do if you were ageing a year for every day that you lived? How would you cope with ageing faster than your peers, becoming physically older than your parents, knowing that instead of having another 60 years to live, you would only have another 60 days. And how much worse would it be as a teenager, with your whole life ahead of you, knowing your dreams and plans would never eventuate?

For Cameron (who I have to say is a bit of an arse in the beginning of the book), he decides to continue living his teenage life as normal - despite being ridiculed and ostracized by his former girlfriend and basketball team-mates, the pressure of his father and the fact that every day he wakes up looking and feeling a year older than the day before.

The characters of Happy Birthday to Me are interesting - Cameron is a self-assured brat at the beginning of the book, but as he rapidly ages he comes to realize some important things about life - as well as having a few creepy and surreal experiences as a 17 year old in the body of an adult. His parents and sister struggle with watching him age before their very eyes, and the adults around him begin to treat him differently, despite that he is still a teenager on the inside.

Happy Birthday to Me is well written - the story is clear and moves at a good pace, is engaging and raises some interesting questions about the restrictions we place on people when they reach a certain age, a family dealing with a medical anomaly and a little bit of supernatural thrown in for extra entertainment.

I did have one niggle with this book, and that was Cameron's relationship with his girlfriend, Charisma (the name just grated on me!). I didn't feel it added much to the story, only made me grind my teeth a little.

As this book is part of a trilogy, I won't say much about the ending (although I did tear up a bit!), but it did definitely make me want to move on to the next book as soon as possible.

1538,"Nick Jans does an excellent job in telling the true story (at least from his perspective) of his six-year friendship with a wild, yet gentle black wolf and the people and dogs of Juneau, Alaska.

Rather then reinvent the wheel, so to speak, in describing what A Wolf Called Romeo is about, I'll just extract parts from the jacket cover which should tell you what you need to know in deciding if this book will be of interest to you: ""A Wolf Called Romeo is the story of a lone black wolf who returned again and again to interact with the people and dogs of Juneau, living on the edges of their community, engaging in an improbable awe-inspiring interspecies dance and bringing the wild into sharp focus. At first the people of Juneau were guarded, torn between shoot-first-ask questions-later instincts and curiousity. But as Romeo began to tag along with cross-country skiers on their daily jaunts, play fetch with local dogs, or simply lie near Nick and nap under the sun, they came to accept Romeo, as he was called by those who came to know him. For Nick, it was about trying to understand Romeo, then it was about winning his trust, and ultimately it was about watching over him for as long as he or anyone could.""

For me, personally, I found A Wolf Called Romeo to be both a very educational read about wolves (although some will argue that Jans, being a wildlife activist, is somewhat biased in the writing), as well as being a very emotional book. The book made made feel that I wanted to be, as were many residents of Juneau, a ""Friend of Romeo"", as well as making me feel that I was right alongside Nick Jans as he lived through his remarkably fascinating and, ultimately, sad experiences with Romeo.

I agree that some of the points of view Jans presents in this book are biased in favor of Romeo and of wildlife in general; but since I, for the most part, hold similar views as the author, I consider A Wolf Called Romeo to be a very compelling and inspiring read. As such, I would highly recommend it to anyone other than those who consider any type of wildlife to be ""fair game.""",4,"[-2.746656891879332, -2.2672497963429286, -0.8726639804932262, -1.0063738463381657, -1.0470438937537807]",-0.8726639804932262

AJ and Brian had a lot of issues in this book. They weren't able to have that HEA or even HFN in this story. Brian is going through a lot BUT so is AJ-she has found out that she is adopted, her adopted parent knew but never told her, her older sister has always known but was probably never going to shareNow Brian, he too is having a lot of issues afters his dads death and a new girls showing up claiming to be his half sister. OH her showing up is all full of twists and turns..I kid you not.

If you do this, Bailey Jenkins, I will hate you forever. And Ill call on my great-grandmother to curse you. She was a Gypsy witch, you know"".

Bailey left Marietta shortly after and she had no plans to come back home but 15 years later and Bailey is back in Marietta to help her mom with her dad after his leg had to be amputated and she is in a very bad place in life, her husband died in a car accident which also killed her beloved horse and she was also hurt her ankle and she is not back to herself not physical and not emotionally so going back home when she is in such a low point in her life sounds like a bad idea.

Paul is divorced with 2 kids and he's not looking for love but when Bailey comes back home it's very hard for him to forgot about her and how strong his feeling for her was 15 years ago. Paul is trying to show Bailey that is still care for her and that he's sorry for the way he treated her when they were in high school.

Bailey and Paul are trying to get to know one another again but family drama comes in the way, Bailey has a very complex relationship with her alcoholic dad and Paul has to deal with his kids, parents and most of all with his older brother and the fact he doesn't like Bailey at all and he keeps trying to make Paul stop seeing her.

A young, sexy-looking, powerful guy breaks in and manages to take out the singer and his companions. Maggie tries to take pictures but the guy takes away her camera and erases the photos. She's annoyed but drawn to this guy who brooks no disagreement. Her friend reminds Maggie of her own present problem and how she might want to connect with this guy after getting his card and phone number. It's not too long before she receives a frightening message on her phone machine that makes her quickly decide to try to engage his help.

Nothing is simple in this multi-layered-plotted story. Trace quickly decides to help Maggie, although his stronger instincts tell him he should walk away and stay uninvolved. He learns she's got a secret that is obviously an obstacle in her inability to get police help and protection for an obvious stalker. Add to that he finds her ultra-sexy, having a penchant for attractive red-headed women. At a certain point, he's sure he's had enough when he learns she's lying to him, plus his ex-girlfriend keeps showing up at the wrong times and always begging for more of what he's left in the past.

Meanwhile the phone messages and written messages inside her apartment heighten the suspense and Maggie's fear. It seems strange that her half-sister and baby appears in the middle of all this chaos and Trace learns one of his former clients has met an untimely and very suspicious end. The pace quickens as does Trace's decision to forgive Maggie; the passion quickly develops along with the threats. Trace is no dummy and while sharing his love of the ocean and ranches manages to solve the prevailing two mysteries of the novel, with a most satisfactory ending that is both surprising and thrilling.

Reese suffered at the hands of selfish boy friends previously and was expecting Jarl Eirik to be the same as all of the previous men in her life. She was pleasantly surprised that he was a totally giving lover who was willing to fight and die for her, even if it meant going against the King Haakon, his selfish half brother, even if it meant traveling though time. The goddess of love Freya, felt sorry for all his sacrifices he'd made in his life and transported him through time to find his lady love after she was sent back home to her time after doing Loki's bidding.

4089,"What an unexpected treasure. As I was perusing one of my favorite reviewer's reads, I came across this book and knew I had to read it. I wasn't sorry. It's such a refreshing change from the bestselling historical romance novels that I've been reading. Well, let's just say, I was ready for a break.

Jerusha (Judy) is an orphan who was raised in an orphanage and winds up being gifted with a college education by one of the trustees of the orphanage. She caught a glimpse of him as he was leaving the orphanage - but only a glimpse. He appeared to be tall and as his shadow is reflected against the wall, his legs looked unnaturally long - hence the name - ""Daddy-Long-Legs."" From her college dorm, she writes to Daddy Long Legs for four long years, but she only hears from him through his secretary, for this was the agreement put in place by her patron. He's a very generous benefactor and has helped orphans before - previously they were boys, but he has made an exception for Judy.

The book is comprised of the letters Judy wrote during these years and amazingly, they held my interest. A very simple life, led by a young woman during the early 1900's who had never even been in anyone's home that she could remember until she finally receives some invites from her college roommates.

Yes, there is a romance and we kinda figure out who the hero is long before Judy does, but that's okay - everything in its season. I'm really glad I read this little book.",4,"[-3.0617178785928454, -1.639322947805074, -0.876640001815685, -1.0154987517489686, -1.540820775084144]",-0.876640001815685

It is short - I read it in about three hours but I found it well written and entertaining. It definitely has the `feel good fact' without being overly soft centred.

Lena has just been released from prison and has decided to make a fresh start somewhere she isn't known. On the long bus journey she starts talking to Moira to whom she mentions that she has just been released from prison. Moira still carries on talking to her and Lena starts to wonder whether she will be able to make a new life for herself. She has somewhere to live - a boarding house - and makes friends with Sally and her little girl Jemima. She has been promised a job in a department store. Moira wants her to go to church with her the Sunday after she arrives - things are definitely looking up.

But Lena will have to overcome a great many problems - not least her lack of money and clothes - before she can start to rebuild her life. Lena is a sympathetic character who refuses to give up in spite of everything that life can throw at her. Through others learn to see life in a different way and Lena herself must learn to trust and be open to the good things which life can bring her.

I shed a few tears over the story and there were many amusing moments so if you think you may have become too cynical or world weary then try this heart warming story - even if it doesn't happen to be Christmas.",3,"[-3.4013581825326265, -1.6154873370968328, -1.0215762569301754, -0.9948898676108816, -0.8766781055747848]",-0.8766781055747848

The  hero, Alexander, starts out as the son of a minor noble thinking his life will be one of peaceful living off the land while being fairly well to do. Things turn ugly for him when his older brother is murdered and he is thrust into the spot his brother was supposed to have.

1422,"NO SECOND CHANCE, a stand-alone thriller by Harlan Coben is well worth the read. This is my ninth Coben novel and it is by far the author's best. In most of his novels Coben highlights some current social or moral issue. In No Second Chance he illuminates the lucrative baby kidnapping, smuggling and selling racket. This gripping novel opens with Dr. Mark Seidman, father of six-month-old Tara, waking up in the hospital after 11 days of being in a coma. He is told that he is the victim of a shooting and lucky to be alive. He has no recollection of the shooting. He is also informed by a local detective and an FBI special agent that his wife died in the brutal shooting and his daughter is missing and believed to have been kidnapped. As in all Coben novels the venue is the New Jersey/New York area. Dr. Seidman is a trained pediatric ophthalmologist who, along with his partner, Zia Leroux, specialize in facial reconstruction in poverty stricken countries in Asia and Africa. Coben, known for his multiple and complex plots grabs the reader's interest from the very start and doesn't let up until the end. While local law enforcement and the FBI have pretty much given up on the case, Dr. Seidman weaves a path of death and destruction over the next 18-months while searching for his daughter. The writer makes sure Marc Seidman is surrounded by some interesting characters. His life-long friend, Lenny, who is also his lawyer; ex-girlfriend and ex-FBI agent, Rachel; and country-boy, Verne, to name a few, all make for a wonderful and supportive cast of friends. Even the bad-guy characters are well developed. Coben, known for his multiple and complex plots grabs the reader's interest from the very start and doesn't let up until the end.

Older, fatter, smoking and drinking no less when hes not working or listening to music, Rebus has been contemplating the possibility of rejoining the force now that the retirement age limit has been amended. The woman and her story intrigue him. The latest missing person is the 15-year-old daughter of a woman in a relationship with criminal connections.

Rebus uncovers enough to convince former colleague DI Siobhan Clarke and her boss the cases are related and gets himself attached to their investigation.

As a civilian, Rebus has no authority but also no restrictions keeping him from applying his normal unorthodox methods to the case. Needless to say, his disdain for authority and his tactics land him in trouble and again under scrutiny by Complaints and his old enemy, Malcolm Fox.

Rebus goes off on his own along the highways and byways of northern Scotland, interviewing an assortment of people and assessing the significance of a photograph sent to family of the missing persons until he sorts it all out for the by-the-book coppers.

1809,"I just finished this amazing novel, Brush of Angels Wings by Ruth Reid last night. These characters will live on in my imagination for a long time. Rachel and Jordan are typical young adults dealing with the hard issues of death of a sibling/parent, regrets, parent relationships and faith. The part that made this novel so amazing in my mind is the addition of Nathaniel and Tangus, both angels, one (Nathaniel) the bright angel, and Tangus the dark one. Some authors would direct the words of the angels to thoughts of the characters, but when used in this way I think it makes more of an imact on the reader that there is another world out there, without coming across as paranormal (though in a sense it really is). If there was a genre called divine intervention, I believe this would be in that category. As such it will likely be a favorite of those readers that like their paranormal novels, but also those of us that don't really enjoy all the elements of that genre.
As well, though the novel takes place in an Amish setting, I would consider this predominately Christian, not only Amish, though some things are mentioned as being not Amish such as electricity, phones, trucks and so on.
I was a little disappointed in the abrupt ending to the novel, as well as the fact that there were numerous issues not resolved.  As this is book 2 in the Heaven on Earth series, I expect to  read more about them. I think it would also be of considerable help to have read #1 first.

565,"About 10 pages into this book, I thought I was in for a great treat. Ms. Leguin is a beautiful writer, and has a rare ability to write about the supernatural without seeming hokey. As a result, I really enjoyed Lavinia's visits to the sacred forest.

The book as a whole, however, did not live up to its early promise. Lavinia was given short shrift by Vergil in the Aeneid, and really, despite the number of pages, she doesn't have a much bigger life in this novel.
First, she doesn't have much personality, unless you count passively acting as a vessel through which fate can operate as personality.  Once she learns what destiny has in store for her, she acts only to comply with it. Thus we are not privy to many personal thoughts about her future, including her husband-to-be.  I would have liked less resigned acceptance and more participation.

Second, as noted by other reviewers, the story still revolves around Aeneas, not Lavinia. The first part of the book leads up to his appearance, the middle part is about their marriage, and the last part about the years after his death.  But the portion of her life after Aeneas, which is portrayed as lasting at least decades, is squashed into a quick recap of some events.  I would have preferred something that was really about Lavinia, and what she did in all that time.

There are a few more minor issues, such as the fact that all the prophesy destroys any suspense for readers not very familiar with the Aeneid, but overall, I think the story was thin, and the context a bit sketchy.",2,"[-2.022789181211736, -1.0796434222663773, -0.8791529884398763, -0.9944079551682171, -1.3624497807993736]",-0.8791529884398763

Once upon a time there was civilization. Something called ""The Damn Stupid"" happened and that civilization was destroyed. What people that remain revert to a technological level of hunting and subsistence farming. The weather changed also, producing something called a Thunderhead, a sort of tornado.

The setting is quaint and the characters are varied and colorful. The development of the characters throughout this series and in this concluding book is commendable. Ann Gabhart has a wonderful talent for creating a great cast of characters and making the reader a part of Hollyhill and sharing all of the activities therein.

If you're looking for an engaging, satisfying and unpredictable story of family and love, mystery and intrigue, wit and comedic events, Summer of Joy will satisfy your quest. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and felt very much a part of the story as I traveled back in time to my own high school years along with Jocie. Grab a copy of this book and relax with a pot of tea. You're in for some great surprises once again. Ann Gabhart is a specialist at creating a warm and sensitive novel.

One reader gave it one star because it, gasp!, began with a painful point in one of the lead character's life. The story revolves around the lives of half sisters, touches on their childhoods and points out how easy it is for children to see things in an entirely different light than the adults around them. I've experienced this in my life and know how difficult growing up can be for both parents and children. The story flows seamlessly between the two women who discover they have more in common than they realized, and their growth both together and individually. I could not put this down and hated for it to end. Ms Higgins also brought to life the secondary players, parents, In laws and friends, and, as her husband is a firefighter, was adept at bringing to life the stresses they live with. Living in a town not far from her's in Connecticut, having grown up in NY, the surroundings in several of her books are familiar and that's always fun.

2180,"I am purposely not a political person. I do not like studying history. Yet, I see the purpose in these as a participant in American culture. I vote, therefore I need to be informed about the vote I am casting.

Dr Lee gives an overview of American history and what lead to the formation of our government and explains some of our laws as they were intended by the authors. A vast number of Americans are upset with the ""change"" we received from the last Presidential election. I don't think many realized how that change would infringe upon our lives.

Dr Lee describes what he sees as a mandate for change, back to what our country was supposed to be about in the first place. There is a lot of history and a lot of current facts which are used to support this view.

This book is deep, yet it all makes sense. I think it's interesting that he even uses examples from Lenin and Marx to support his views. He sites battles over the definition of family and marriage, the health care dilemma, problems in our schools and the basic dignity of human life as the major areas where a growing number of Americans want change. Or at least to get rid of the change we just had forced upon us.

The last chapter is ""What You Can Do' and it really spells out steps you can take personally to start making a difference.

1599,"When the Hogarth Shakespeare series strikes a home run -- as it did with Hagseed by Margaret Atwood -- it's a thing to behold. But when it misses, it misses by a mile. New Boy transfers the story of Othello to a a 1970s grade school in suburban D.C., and reimagines Othello through the story of three 11 year-olds -- the Ghana transfer student O for Othello, the popular girl Dee for Desdemona, and the nefarious school bully Ian for Iago. The handkerchief is eschewed for a strawberry pencil case.

 Othello is one of my favorite Shakespeare plays and this book has been on my radar for some time. The original Othello is complex, a military success whose Achilles heel is his jealousy; his insecurities stem from his darker skin color and bouts with epilepsy.  Here, there are few nuances (for the longest time, it seems like O has no flaws) and the racial tension becomes cliched and sometimes even pedantic.  Take these lines: ""Life is not easy for anyone. If anything, he has it too easy. He'll grow up and walk right into a good job, thanks to affirmative action. A good job that someone more qualified should have done."" Or this: ""Go back to Africa, my little brother...where being black is normal and white skin is made fun of.""

Characters and plot lines are over-simplified and the 11 year olds just don't have that sense of verisimilitude; sometimes, their thoughts seem well beyond their years. It doesn't help that the action, which is spread over months in Othello, is here confined to a single day. Tracy Chevalier is a fine writer that could and should have done better  I remain a fan of this Hogarth series and its ambitious vision of proving the relevance of Shakespeare to new generations of readers.",1,"[-1.5228209707575724, -0.8814188839330058, -1.1537957966890817, -1.0247534188068572, -0.8840419128278352]",-0.8814188839330058

1133,"American Rust is a very bleak tale that takes place in current-day Western Pennsylvania. The plot is set early on in the book - two of the protagonists find themselves in a situation beyond their control - and the aftermath and repercussions of their actions are what drive the very minimal story-line. The narration bounces back and forth between a connected set of characters, each with their own set of dreams and problems as they try to escape - figuratively and actually - the dire circumstances they find themselves in. This book received much praise when published; I didn't think American Rust lived up to its billing.

Consciously or not, I felt the writing was an attempt to emulate the novels of Cormac McCarthy- dark and brooding. Unfortunately where McCarthy's books are terse and concise, American Rust is verbose, rambling and repetitive. The combined narration of each of the story-tellers becomes a collective self-flagellation. Their inability to make decisions - and the few circumstantial ones they do make - becomes paralyzing and the story becomes dismally predictable, i.e. one bad outcome after another. Understanding that such phenomena do mirror real-life, they are not all encompassing; there is no balance here. By the end of the book I had lost both empathy for the characters and interest in the - I repeat myself - minimal story.

Dark stories are one thing but pitiful is another - pass on this one - extremely tedious reading.",0,"[-2.619571756271094, -0.9641413432879204, -0.8819169999448575, -0.9781845158750831, -1.3232265949439728]",-0.8819169999448575

It is so unknown, that one of his biggest fans, didn't even realize that this film was based on a story by Dick, until I saw it in the credits. As usual, the story is out of this world, as it takes place in the distance future, a future where the Earth is at war with an alien species. This species has the ability to clone humans in such a realistic way, that it is nearly impossible to detect them. Special military investigator, Hathaway (Vincent D'Onofrio), is tasked with figuring out who has been replaced. On the eve of a big announcement by the President, Hathaway intercepts a transmission claiming that her top military adviser, Dr. Spencer Olham (Gary Sinise), has been replaced. When Hathaway confronts Olham, he claims to have no knowledge of this, and unlike previous replicates, he has memories. As Hathaway prepares to eliminate Olham, he escapes to the surface, where he teams up with the exiled citizens who live there. Together they try to prove Olham's innocence, while avoiding being captured by Hathaway. Vincent D'Onofrio stars as Hathaway, and much like his role in Law & Order: Criminal Intent his intensity and determination are infectious. He's paired with Gary Sinise, an actor I'm always disappointed to see in a leading role, and whom always manages to surprise me with a great performance. He isn't what I'd call an action star, and may not have been ideal for the role of Olham, but he was very believable. Impostor was only one of Dick's short stories, but it is every bit as good as his better known works, which of course include; Blade Runner, Total Recall, and Minority Report. If you want to see a unique story that blends Science Fiction, Drama, and Action, look no further than Impostor.",4,"[-3.221136146653741, -1.3892298026236038, -1.256215507992874, -0.9946553917845888, -0.8831133221529174]",-0.8831133221529174

When it looks like they might be closer to their destination than anyone thought, she becomes excited and will do anything to get off the ship.

I absolutely loved the first book, Across the Universe. I seem to read a lot of YA fantasy but not a lot of YA science fiction and that's part of my strong affection for this series. The other part is that the idea of leaving earth in Godspeed for another planet, hopefully a better planet, is such a fantastic idea and I've loved watching this play out.

For me, A Million Suns was even better than the first book. Across the Universe  set up the story and it really developed into a fast-paced thrilling story in A Million Suns.

Scared that his world might taint Evie, he selflessly lets her go. What Kick never understood was that Evie loves him unconditionally and she would have endured every bit of his darkness just to have him by her side.

The saving grace of this book had to be Evie and Kicks childhood love. Add in Kick's knowledge in the pleasure department and you'll definitely be in for a treat.

The keyboard is approximately 13 inches by six inches. This gives me much more flexibility when I am working at my desk and have a bunch of papers in front of me. I can move the keyboard around my desk with ease.

My only complaint is that the keyboard does not have little pullout legs that allow it to be raised at an angle. If I am resting the keyboard on my lap it is not a big deal but I am usually working at a desk and I am used to a keyboard at an angle.

2810,"This start to a brand new series from an author who knows just what a reader wants, is most definitely worth the hype.

The story started off hooking me right away, but slowed down almost immediately after Feyre was taken captive. Much of the first half of the book moves at a slow pace as the reader gets to know Tamlin, Lucien, and their home. A lot of in-depth world building brings Prythian to life and takes the readers imagination on a sensory-overload journey, whilst the same amount of time is spent on the slow-burn romance between Feyre and Tamlin.

The second half of the book was more to my taste as Feyre was given three harrowing tasks to prove her love for Tamlin. Enter Rhysand, the High Lord of the Night Court, and things really start heating up for Feyre.

I didn't always like Feyre and found her too proud and headstrong. She seemed to make a lot of purposely stupid decisions, risking her own safety for nothing. But she really redeemed herself in the second half of the story. She was put to the test again and again, and with every blow she had to endure, my liking her increased.

I think Rhysand was a great addition to the story, and although Im not a fan of love-triangles, this one had me undecided whether I want Tamlin or Rhysand to be the winner of Feyres affections. Oh, well, I guess Ill just have to wait and see whats going to happen in book two. The best I can hope for is that the sequel won't turn out to be an angsty tug-of-war emotionally for Freya when she has to make a choice.

If it wasn't for the hype and the persistent glowing reviews everywhere I turned, I probably wouldnt have read this book, even though I enjoyed Throne of Glass immensely. I am tired of these types of stories that stick to an over-familiar formula, and therefore was wary to read this.

2141,"Frankly, if it wasn't for one nagging thing, I'd give The Technologists by Matthew Pearl a full-on five star review. It was (nearly) everything I look for in a mystery/suspense book - fascinating, documented historical happenings, lively characters, strange and unusual events, unsympathetic treatment of the ""bad guy,"" twists and turns, and a push against the stereotypical treatment of women of the times.

So what is that one nagging thing keeping me back from full-on ranting and raving? Well - it's a simple thing really...

The story took forever to gain momentum. Seriously, 150 pages in and I was wondering when something, anything, was going to start to pull together. I understand that a good mystery needs a solid foundation, for all the bare bones to be put together in a way that will make for an explosive ending, but I couldn't figure out what the heck was going on until the Technologists club was formed.

Now, once that club was formed things began to make sense. Marcus Mansfield was a fantastic lead character. He had a sympathetic background story, set in the Civil War (which makes it doubly interesting). He wasn't a ""rich boy,"" rather a guy that was making it on his own. He was inquisitive, insightful, and an all around great character.

Hammie, the clueless rich kid was also great - I never knew where I, as the reader, was supposed to stand with regard to his placement in the group until the end of the story. Bob Richards showed remarkable growth in character, Edwin Hoyt fulfilled his role perfectly, and then there was Ellen Swallow.

Oh people, how I loved this character. A chemist, Ellen Swallow attends MIT in the company of a school filled with men, and she keeps to her own for very good reasons. However, she might just be the smartest one in the group and how I loved the wit and wisdom she brought to the group.

I do recommend this one, but understand that good things take time to mature. The end result is worthwhile (it surprised me, I didn't see it coming!), and most of all, the afterward by the author about the history of MIT is worth the read in and of itself.",3,"[-2.1702049838881834, -0.9619533340685258, -0.8887632029294633, -1.008592846606544, -1.6118336677381158]",-0.8887632029294633

Binchy transports the reader to a small, quiet Greek island of Aghia Anna, where she introduces us two a group of four young people, each from a different country, and all of whom are running away from something back home.  There is Thomas, the American, who is leaving behind a divorce and trying to escape his fears that he no longer has a place in his son's life.  Next is David, the quiet, thoughtful young man from England, an only child burdened by his parents' expectations that he will take over the family business.  Elsa, a beautiful German girl, seems to have come to Greece to hide from someone who she is desperately trying to avoid, and finally, Fiona, a sweet Irish girl, has left home to be with her boyfriend, Shane, despite the objections of everyone who cares about her.

These four strangers form strong bonds of friendship around tragedy:  a fire on a tour boat disrupts the peaceful island village life.  They become close not only to each other but also to several locals, including Andreas, the owner of the taverna where they meet, and Vonni, Thomas's mysterious landlord, an enigmatic Irishwoman who has lived on Aghia Anna for many years.  As the story unfolds, each member of this unlikely group shares his or her history with the others, and slowly, their fortunes begin to become mingled with each other, causing them all to question their expectations for the future.

I enjoyed this story, but I was a bit disappointed in the ending.  Compared to the other three, Binchy seemed to leave David's story rather unfinished, or at least not in a very good place.

5962,"Stay by Sarina Bowen and Elle Kennedy

I'd been eagerly awaiting the next book in this duo's WAGs series and Stay did not disappoint. Matthew Eriksson is the 'sniper' for Toronto's hockey team and is left heartbroken and jaded after his divorce. His ex-wife took his twin daughters and micromanages every moment they spend with him. He's a rare species of (fictional) male that doesn't turn to manwhoring the minute his wife is out of the picture and I wholly respected him for that. Matt uses a service called Fetch - essentially a virtual assistant provider and when he voices his concerns over his recent dog-walker, the co-owner of Fetch herself walks the dog. Evidently, Matt likes what he sees on the doggy-cam and makes his moves.

Hailey is the co-owner of Fetch, a business she owns with her ex-husband. She gets the feeling that the man she's communicating with online is her crush, the one and only Matt Eriksson but she can't be sure until he leaves her a gift on one of her dog-walking sessions. She's not your typical bitter divorcee but she is heartbroken. Perhaps more at losing her best friend than losing her husband.

Matt and Hailey had a lot to work through and I enjoyed their journey to the end. Matt's ex-wife left invisible scars and he really had to work hard to get through it. It was almost as though he was waiting for the other shoe to drop with Hailey but it never did. She was the perfect woman for him.

The only problem was me reading Good Boy before getting stuck into Stay and expecting that same level of humor. But really, how can one expect that same humor when the main character isn't Blake Riley? I loved the presence of Wesmie and Jess and of course, Blakey himself (I freaking love that guy!) - it's like visiting family again which is always lovely. This book can easily be read as a standalone, however reading Good Boy first would only enhance your enjoyment of Stay and if you really want to go all out, you should go and read Him and Us first!

2880,"I had the most fun with this one. This was the way to start a new series. Willful, strong, independent, capable, sassy, witty, and a princess. Gun toting, knife wielding, bandit hunting, feisty little sister Gillian was a bit more than the Duke of Leverton was expecting. Gillian grandmother needed help with getting her granddaughter caught up to what she should have already known.

Immediate dislike between the two was clear. A perfect match for each other was even clearer. The instata love and hop right in to bed was not this one. Thank you. Gillian carries this story all the way to the end. Not to discount Charles presences. She was everything a heroine should aspire to be. She was a peoples princess. She could ride with the best of them. She could shoot, fight, hunt. She was all that a free woman of strength, courage, beauty, lineage could be.

Charles found all her quality appealing to him but not suitable for the ton. She need work and polish. She was going to make none of it easy. She was who she was because of what she was. Confusing but true. If she would have been raise in the home of her father she would not have been the heroine that I love. She gave it all and then some. She didn't back down. She stood her ground. Charles has rarely found any one that could change his take on the world. Gillian made that change in small increments but she proved that she was more than just a female in breeches.

V. Kelly brought me a heroine that will be held on to and revisited just for who she was and the strength of character she displayed.

They will all be favorites for me, because they're set in my birth place and home town of Seattle.  The stories seem so much more real when you can see the scenes in your mind.  But that is certainly no distraction from Jance's great writing abilities.  It's just an added attraction for me.  I really love the way her books are so smoothly written.  Everything is so clear and characters' feelings so easy to understand.  I almost never have to reread a passage to get the meaning, when written by Jance.

5258,"Aria Rose is 25 years old and on her way to becoming a critically acclaimed actress when she finds nude photos of herself online. She wonders how someone could be so cruel to take photos of her unknowingly and post them for the world to see.

Ben Lawson is the new CEO of Shepard Film Studios and has finally managed to get his life back in order after his split from his ex-wife Marion. He knows he shouldn't have feelings for actress Aria Rose but there is something about her that draws him in and he can't seem to get enough.

But one day there lives are turned upside down when the photos are released and when Ben realizes his part in it he vows to do whatever he can to make it up to Aria, although the damage has already been done.

This was such a great book on finding the good through all of the bad.

I thought Aria was such a great character and one thing I loved was her dedication to her family. She had very few people close to her but those that were close were very dedicated, like Steele. She was a caring girl who realized she got in over her head with one of her relationships and knew that she had to get out of it.

The attraction between Aria and Ben was intense right from the beginning although both were scared to get involved as they didn't want it to affect the release of Aria's latest movie. They didn't want it to appear like she only got the job because of her relationship with Ben.

Ben was also hesitant about getting involved with Aria due to his relationship with his ex-wife and what he went through with her. But he knew that Aria was different than Marion and he didn't want to let her go. When he realized how bad he messed up he truly did everything in his power to make everything right and was willing to at any cost.

Although I absolutely hated what happened to Aria with the pictures I loved her response to it and how she was truly able to turn it around in a positive manner. I absolutely loved the message of the author in embracing ourselves and loving our inside and outside.

This book had a truly empowering message and the author did such a great job at having that come out. Loved it!!",4,"[-2.880942701326207, -1.9182432028081198, -1.1839454380651107, -0.994090800392763, -0.891319498551086]",-0.891319498551086
1444,"It's post Civil War Texas in 1876.  The Leigh brothers, oldest Dallas, Houston, and young Austin, lost their parents some years ago and should be a close-knit trio, but, unfortunately, the relationships are a bit strained.  Their problems (Dallas' and Houston's) go back to the uneasy relationship with their father and their traumatic experiences as very young teens fighting in the Civil War.

Houston, the brother featured in this first book of Heath's trilogy, was not only damaged emotionally by the war but also physically, with half his face disfigured and scarred, one eye lost and no hearing in one ear.  He's withdrawn from most social contact, content to live in his small cabin and work with wild mustangs.

Dallas, the oldest brother, has a much bigger cattle ranch and big ambitions to go with it.  He wants to create a bustling metropolis out of the small town near his ranch, once the railroad comes through.  And he needs a wife so that he can share all this with the children they will have.  But women are mighty scarce.

So he gets himself a mail-order bride.  Now Amelia Carson is on her way to Texas to marry him.  Dallas, unfortunately, broke his leg just days before he was to meet her at the train station, so he enlists Houston to pick Amelia up and escort her on the 3-week trip back to his ranch.

Well, that 3-week trip turns into the adventure of a lifetime and a bonding experience for Houston and Amelia.  This is quite the emotional ride for them and for the reader.  Lots of action and adventure, angst, anguish and self-denial and also, unfortunately, a lot of failures to communicate on the part of the brothers and on the part of Houston and Amelia.

If you can forgive Heath for all her characters' inability to express their feelings to each other, you'll find this to be a darned good book.  Written in 1997, it's a better read than most of her more recent Regency and Victorian romances.  Maybe she should go back to writing Westerns.  Her stories set in England lack authenticity.",3,"[-2.5201452604131704, -1.1119559279529285, -1.0276534338982468, -0.9978203464011309, -0.8917373867168071]",-0.8917373867168071

It is not your usual MC. They have a different mission than most clubs. Leon has quite a past and wants to put that behind him. There are some pieces that he is more interested in remembering.

There are lots of surprises in the story and I am not going to spoil them. It definitely is an interesting journey for them. Cherry and Leon have chemistry from the beginning and they make a great team. I enjoyed seeing Cherry go for what she wanted and not be limited by her past.

9494,"Days after finishing the film, I am still haunted by the themes of survival and desperation and longing. Glenn Close plays Albert Nobbs, a butler in a small hotel in Dublin where he works quietly and efficiently, keeps to himself and hoards the coins he receives as tips in hopes of someday escaping the life of service and opening his own shop. When a painter is hired temporarily and ordered to share Nobbs' room, he panics at the thought that his secret will be revealed. The painter does discover that Nobbs is actually a woman but is not shocked and agrees to keep quiet about it. We also find the reason why Nobbs is masquerading as a woman. The painter reveals his own secret, which gives Nobbs hope for the future and a new way to find connection with another person in spite of the duplicitous life he has lived for decades.

The film is centered around the workers at the hotel and the relationships they form with each other. They never suspected that Nobbs was a woman, but found him to be a very odd little man. Nobbs lives a joyless, friendless, desperate life, but there is a scene where he (she) breaks free and runs on the beach with a childish abandon, smiling broadly.

The setting in Dublin provides a beautiful backdrop to this period piece. ""Albert Nobbs"" is an interesting and evocative character study, with a terrific performance turned in by Glenn Close.",4,"[-4.281499366771692, -0.8927136048589983, -1.1919165281311694, -1.0005348400075373, -0.9395450646782963]",-0.8927136048589983

The play between her and Jared was just perfect. You could actually *see* Jared being just shocked to be up against such an admirable foe. And you could see him loosen up the longer they were together. But it wasn't all just funny. There were some serious issues dealt with here and there too. There were a few plot twists that I was surprised with and maybe didn't enjoy as much, but really in the end it was fabulous.

359,"Responding to a domestic disturbance call, two Yorkshire police officers stumble into a killer's lair. One ends up dead, the other, Janet Taylor, finds herself facing possible murder charges. Detective Superintendent Alan Banks arrives at a scene of bloody carnage to find his serial murder case solved.

The horrific, atmospheric opening scenes of Edgar award-winner Peter Robinson's ""Aftermath,"" set up the whole story - the themes of abuse and psychological damage, police accountability and politics and a host of nagging questions. How does a handsome, popular teacher like Terry Payne end up as serial killer of young girls and how did he lure them so easily? What did his beautiful, abused wife, Lucy, know about the atrocities in the basement of her own house?
The lines of the murder mystery interweave with the private lives of Banks and his team. Banks struggles with the news that his ex-wife is pregnant while Banks' on-again, off-again girlfriend, the ambitious Annie Cabot, is assigned to investigate Janet Taylor's culpability in the death of the serial killer and troubled psychologist Jenny Fuller profiles Lucy Payne, rekindling her attraction to Banks. Another victim of abuse, a neighbor, desperate to help Lucy, uses and is used by the media, garnering possibly dangerous attention. Meanwhile, one of the missing girls is not found in Payne's macabre basement graveyard.
Robinson draws the reader with his superb characterizations and thoughtful pacing. As always, his novel is as much about the world we live in - everyday realities and aberrant fringes - as it is about a particular murder. The tension builds to an explosive climax of split-second timing but the more leisurely twists, turns and missteps of the investigation and the investigators create a human drama that lingers in the mind.",4,"[-3.702085402812563, -2.170870855201484, -1.0272710265403038, -1.0207198316698454, -0.8941365614339649]",-0.8941365614339649

We have come a long way with these characters and in this installment Clydes sister, Grace, and her husband, Paul, come to Crystal Haven for a visit. This is the first time in fifteen years that Grace has returned. She didn't want anything to do with the psychic abilities of her family even though she has an ability herself that she uses daily. That ability may be why she has come home. Of course, seeing her son Seth, is always a bonus.

They quickly get caught up in a town celebration that includes a Zombie Fun Fun. This is the 2nd book I have read recently that has included a zombie event in a town celebration. Zombies aren't really my thing but since these were costume events and no actual zombies were featured so I enjoyed it quite a bit.

When the fun run ends, the partying begins for all but one of the participants. One of the runners didn't show up at the party and was found murdered in the woods. Grace has only been in town a couple of days and someone decides she or Paul could be the murderer/s. With Mac on the police department Clyde knows he will prove their innocence, but it doesnt stop her for doing a little investigating too.

This story is absolutely fantastic! So much happens within these pages and I don't want to give anything away.

Dawn Eastman has written a very captivating mystery featuring the characters we have grown to love. I have my reservations about Grace and Paul but their situation is pretty precarious so that may tilt the scales more in their favor. Clydes family is a little over the top. I love Aunt Vi. Sometimes I want to hug her and other times I want to lock her in the basement and throw away the key. Mac handles her much better than I ever could. The Fortune Family is not your normal Midwest family but Mac loves Clyde so her family and all their shenanigans are part of the package. Yes, even when they find a dead body or try to find some lost diamonds.

The paranormal aspect was a little more present in this story as Clyde tries to refine her gift. It has become more interesting as she learns her capabilities.

Each of these stories is even better than the last. This is one of my favorite books I have read this year. I highly recommend the entire series.",4,"[-2.71049102583177, -1.152509793416192, -1.168377395465888, -1.0072528467758595, -0.8943754164713702]",-0.8943754164713702

Since she was a child, Tamara Posts mother has drilled into her that looks and money are everything. Forced into competing in beauty pageants and being with sugar daddies, Tamara has created and maintained an ice queen persona to keep her feelings at bay. Now, with the death of her sister, Tamara is thrust into survival and protection mode when her niece's father tries to sell her off to the highest bidder. There isn't anything she wouldnt do to make sure her niece is safe, even if it means blackmailing her ex-husband.

Isaac Camacho believes himself to be a lone wolf. Hes running from and haunted by his past. This former Marine always tries to do whats right. When Tamara tries to blackmail her former husband, Isaac is tasked with looking into her life. When he discovers her brother-in-law is the leader of a cult and that theres an arrest warrant out on Tamara for kidnapping, the good guy in him has to help her out.

Tamara never expected to find an ally in Isaac, in helping to protect and rescue her niece. Neither expected to fall in love with each other or find a home with B-Squad, the company owned by Tamaras ex-husband and his fiance.

I'm a huge fan of Melissa Cutler's ICE Black Ops series and the B-Squad series reminds me of that series. Bang is really good. Avery did a wonderful job of putting in details that allow the reader to visualize what's happening. I just wanted more shoot em up, bang up action that I know Avery is capable of giving. While the members of B-Squad make appearances, I wanted more time with them.

The characters of Tamara and Isaac surprised me with their depth, heart, passion and true personalities. They made it extremely easy to lose myself to the book and their story. I cant wait for the next book in this series.

2819,"Revival is the sort of book Stephen King would inevitably write, and I mean this in a good way. Its classic King of the 2000s: not an outright horror story, but definitely with some terrifying elements that give you shivers, some memorable Kingly characters, and a story that just makes you wonder.

Revival is a coming of age story for Jamie Morton, unsurprisingly, in a small, quaint New England town where everybody knows each other, and expects to see each other at church on Sunday. And at the Methodist church theres a new preacher in town, one Reverend Charles Jacobs. Jamie met him the other day and instantly took a liking to him, and soon pretty much everyone is a fan of the new preacher, making Sunday School now a well-attended event, while Mrs. Jacobs soon becomes the apple of a many a boys eye.

Revival also features magic, of a sort. The Reverend Jacobs has some interesting hobbies that Jamie gets to see in his special shed where he invents unique devices that seem to use a new form of energy and would likely be very popular if they were sold worldwide. Jacobs jokes about doing this one day, when his experiment is complete. It is then that Jamie starts to realize that his might be more than a hobby, perhaps more of an obsession. But then tragedy strikes the Jacobs family and when the reverend recants his faith and decries the inexistence of God to his congregation, he leaves town.

Revival then follows Jamies life becoming a guitarist as a teenager and playing in various bands through his twenties, living the life of a nomadic musician traveling from town to town. He also adopts the rock star life and becomes addicted to drugs, because he is a Stephen King character after all. He is at an all time low with his heroin addiction when he meets the Reverend Jacobs again.

Revival is a story of many things and the title aptly applies to many of them. Its about Jamies life and life choices, and Jacobs and what he hopes to accomplish with his inventions. While the eventual reveal of Jacobss quest is somewhat disappointing (as is the case with a number of Kings endings), overall Revival is an exciting and contemplative read that will leave you contemplating numerous things.

512,"Heat Lightning is the second adventure of Virgil Flowers. Virgil is a law enforcement officer working for the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, (BCA) - a special and elite group of cops. For those of you familiar with Sandford's work, this should ring a bell, the author's most ""famous"" character - Lucas Davenport of the ""Prey"" series - runs the BCA, and in fact Virgil works for him. (Davenport slips in and out of these spin-off books.)

I enjoy the Lucas Davenport books - they're quick entertaining reads with Lucas usually on the trail of some psycho-killer. Virgil is a recycled or updated Davenport. There are some differences, Virgil is blonde - Lucas dark; Virgil falls head over heels in love on a regular basis and he's fisherman; Davenport is tad bit more subdued and likes computer games - but Virgil's attitude, dialogue and mind-set are the same as Davenport's. So if you like Lucas Davenport, you'll like Virgil Flowers.

Where the books differ somewhat are in the plots. The Flowers' books are more complicated. Davenport is usually tracking a murderer; Virgil gets involved in conspiracies. For instance in this book Virgil's sleuthing takes him all the way back to the Vietnam War. There's a little too much of Virgil traveling - be it by car, truck, boat or plane - which gets tiresome, but otherwise, just like the Davenport ""Prey"" series, Heat Lightning is a quick, entertaining read - perfect for the beach or airport.",3,"[-4.106127689570774, -1.7411724475894133, -0.8960622562966657, -1.013407811434727, -1.3599178373446685]",-0.8960622562966657

Her job is to make a sketch of a serial rapist. But this is no simple task, as all of the victims have disappeared. Soon after she is joined by her teenage daughter, she accepts a second assignment- going undercover in a serpent handling church. She is motivated by a large reward if she detects any illegal activity, which she desperately need since it appears that her cancer has returned. But as she soon discovers, danger can come from anywhere, even from where she least expects. Can she find out what is going on, and convince anyone else of the truth, before she becomes a victim herself?

I really liked the snake handling church part of this book, I thought it was interesting, and I learned a lot from that aspect.  I had never heard of something like that, so it was pretty weird to learn about that part of Christianity. I had also never read a book about a forensic artist, so it was neat to learn a little about what they do.

I also enjoyed the characters in the book. They drew me in, and held my attention the whole time. I found myself suspecting some people who were actually in the right, and I enjoyed the interaction between Gwen and her daughter. Their interaction was one of my favorite parts, as they learned to respect each other.

In the end I definitely enjoyed the whole book. I loved the story line, and the storys setting was a well thought out one in my opinion. There was a definite Christian theme through out, but it was not too over powering. There was a little bit of romance, but being a guy, it was my least favorite part.

Margaret is drawn to Henry, even though all he sees of her are her freckles and plainness.  But as he spends more time with her, he is drawn to her and her sister.  I found Margaret a difficult character to get to know but by the end I felt such sympathy for her rough road.  At one point she completely reminded me of Martha in the Bible  always serving.

1928,"What a beautiful story. There is something to be said for authors who use their imaginations for good rather than evil. With so many dark books on the market filled with murder and mayhem, finding a great book where the bonds of friendship and family ties are the center of the novel has gotten increasingly hard. Don't get me wrong, I like action and adventure in my books as much as the next person, but when I want to settle down for the day and enjoy a cup of tea next to the fireplace, it is this type of book that calls to me.

  This engaging book is set in 1841 and is about a woman who operates a boarding house. I will not give away too much of the story as I would hate to ruin it for prospective readers, but there are so many layers to this story and so much to love about the characters that I found it impossible to put down.

  This book has no foul language or anything offensive and would be perfect for an afternoon of Christian reading. What I found most captivating about this book were the author's descriptions of Hill House and the property that surrounds it. You can imagine sitting on that porch watching the sun fade into moonlight with Emma and her guests. I loved the romantic feel of this book. I felt like I was transported back to a time when life was not as complicated as it is now; a time when people worried only over things they needed to.

The bad side is that some paranormal creatures spend time with her so they can go back to living as a human and not some mythical creature.

The story starts with the vampire Dashiell calling Scarlett into a crime scene in a forest. When she gets there late, she is stunned at the level of destruction. Unfortunately, that is when newby detective Jesse Cruz gets there. It's bad enough that Scarlett if found at the scene like she had something to do with it. It's even worse when a wolf charges the area and changes into a naked man right in front of Jesse.

Jesse becomes obsessed and hunts Scarlett down. This leads him into finding out about the Old World and places a contract on his head. Now Scarlett and Jesse have to find the real killer or they will take the punishment. But they are not alone. There is also Eli, Scarlett's prot&eacute;g&eacute; that hates being a wolf and makes Scarlett feel like she is being used when he spends time with her.

I liked this book. It's the first story that I have read with a character that is a null. This is a great idea and I love how Scarlett's character is used and used to save the paranormal community. I am not a fan of the love triangle. But it done really well and hinted at instead of having the story wrapped around it.

This is the first book in the series and could use a little fine tuning. But I have really gotten into the characters and I can't wait to read the next book. I hope it is released soon. This is a great paranormal story with a fresh perspective. This is one book that you will not want to miss.

Knoah is a widow who trying to find a way to move on and be happy after the lost of her husband Dylan; then one day she meets Garrick and her entire world changes.

1062,"""Ava's Man"" is a loving tribute to Rick Bragg's maternal grandfather, written in his trademark spare, elegant prose.  It is also a paean to the rural South and to a vanished way of life. In the southern tradition of looking to the past, Bragg has reconstructed the short, difficult, meaningful life of Charlie Bundrum.  He must have relied heavily on the memories of his mother, Margaret, who was perhaps the neediest of Charlie's brood, and thus the closest to her father.
  Charlie was a man who was fiercely protective of his eight children, and a hard-working father who would do just about anything to provide for them.  He died at 51, worn out from long years of labor, and suffering from a liver ailment caused by decades of drinking moonshine.
  Having just reviewed ""...and Ladies of the Club"", this reviewer cannot help contrasting the southern culture Bragg describes with the midwestern, community-minded society of that book.  Few men of Charlie's era in that society died so young. The midwest is filled with long-lived descendants of the Germans and Scandinavians who first populated the area.  This is just one of the many north/south differences which will become apparent as you read Bragg's book.

  Charlie was a proud, independent man, in the Jeffersonian tradition.  Family came first in his hardscrabble life, although he was charitable, taking in an outcast older man who lived with the family for many years. Bragg has done a wonderful job of fleshing out the grandfather he never knew. In ""Ava's Man"" you will find it easy to look beyond the southern stereotypes to find
the real man, Charlie Bundrum.  Highly recommended!",4,"[-1.9113595494290463, -0.8978467217913646, -1.174743768744686, -0.9987262654194948, -1.0841818490343333]",-0.8978467217913646

It's always fun watching them fall in love and seeing all their stories intertwine, and this series is no different. JLA brings the same flair and style to this book as she does with all her books, so if you like that, then you'll enjoy this. She kind of straddles the line of Paranormal with this book, and I often wondered if it was going to turn into that, but the book is Adult Romance at its core.

I will say that the mystery was pretty obvious, so if you're clever like that and can easily figure these things out, just keep that in mind. It's not hard. That usually doesn't deter me from a book, but one of these days I want to be truly stumped. In any case, it takes quite awhile for things to be revealed, as it is with most books, so also keep that in mind. Most of the book is focused on the growing attraction between Lucian and Julia and development of their relationship. The only thing that bothered me about their relationship was the whole ""Ms. Hughes"" thing. While I thought it was funny and cute at first, after while, it was just overkill. Besides that minor issue, I liked watching their story progress.

I am definitely curious to learn more about the other brothers and their family dynamic. That's probably the most intriguing and captivating thing about this series. There's just something about them and who they deal with that makes me wonder and keeps me coming back for more.

You will see a botched job of detective and police work done which contributed to the monster staying out of jail, despite committing gruesome crimes.
The book is about the crimes and investigations that are still ongoing.  The detail work by the writers is fastidious, but very frustrating, both to the writers and the readers.
Ultimately, one wishes for a resolution that didn't happen.  Knowing the monster is on the loose is disquieting.

Maverick comes back home after a decade being a professional bull rider.
He left his family behind to fulfill his own life dream. Although it was probably his father the one who pushed him away. But he left behind someone else.
Leighton had a crush on Mav ten years ago. She is his little sister's best friend. And they didn't part on good terms.
But things were much more complicated back then. Mav's family life was not easy and he needed to escape, even if it meant leaving Leighton, and his love for her, behind.

Setting: Terra Haven

Sexual Content: none

Tense: Past

Point of View: First Person

Although its only 97 pages, its jam-packed with action and excitement. I really enjoyed reading this novella.

The story is about a young woman named Mika who has magical abilities working with quartz. She is asked to help a baby gargoyle save her brother. Mika learns that her abilities are greater than she knew. Mika is thrown into a very dangerous situation.

I liked that the story began with Mika using her abilities. It set everything up so the reader wasn't wondering what her abilities were or how they worked. I also liked how the author came up with a lot of new kinds of magical skills that I have never read about before. For example, Mikas friend is skilled with air magic. She can send rumor scouts to gather information. I thought this was cool

Another great thing about this story was how Mikas goals conflicted with one another. She was trying to start a business and had to get work done for that, but she also had to try to help save the baby gargoyles.

The story had a happy conclusion, but it was easy to see how the story could evolve into more books. I would like to read more in this series.

Emma is a scientist who believes in the paranormal and suspects there is more to her family than she knows. She is very correct and discovers she is a Princess and can shift into a bear. Her mother wants her to be ready to take the throne but she has to find her mate first.

Second chance romance novels are difficult for me to read as the couple is dealing with past hurts that have withstood time.  There are so many  shoulda, woulda, coulda moments that cause me to cringe.
That being said, I thought the author does a good job outlying  Hawke and Vale's younger self.  The carefree, self-absorbed nature of this couple was brilliant.  It encapsulated their youth.

It was sad that Vale needed to break free from Hawke to become a better person.  She needed  to break the chains .

2109,"The work of prolific, award-winning novelist Joyce Carol Oates spans a wide spectrum of controversial topics.  Her new novel, Jack of Spades: A Tale of Suspense takes a lighter approach than some of her other work.  Andrew J. Rush, a successful, best-selling mystery novelist, has a secret.  He has been called ""the gentleman's Stephen King"" but, unbeknownst to his fans or even to his family, he writes noirish pulp fiction under the pseudonym Jack of Spades.

When a local crank takes Rush to court for supposedly stealing her work and publishing it as his own, Rush's Jack of Spades alter-ego leads him down a path of obsession and uncharacteristic behavior.  Oates gives some insight into the life of a writer, the things that inspire and bother him, and the way his fame and success puts pressure on him.  I can't help but wonder how much of Rush's story is autobiographical, as Oates herself has published under a couple of pseudonyms.  Are the pseudonymous works a reflection of the writer's true character, a whimsical side entertainment, or an important complement to his well-known books?

Oates builds the tension of Jack of Spades as Rush lets his obsession with his literary accuser take over his thoughts.  She includes some humorous nods to Stephen King and other mystery/horror writers, and ends up turning the story into a plot with a resolution worthy of Edgar Allan Poe.  It's a bit dark.  OK, plenty dark, but in a dark comedy sort of way.  I think King and Poe would approve.

As in, they're officially one of my all-time favorite couples in the world of M/M romance and that's saying something because that list is exclusive for those men who I was fully invested in and still obsess over. Ezra and Dae may be opposites in more ways than one but it's those differences that make them so darn perfect for each other. It's like one fills the gaps within the other, and in the end, they make one another whole, though it's clear that Ezra has more issues than Dae does based on Ezra's past relationship and his upbringing alone. But Ezra is also the one who makes Dae see that he is open to commitment...with the right man.

Now, there was some apprehension on my end when the whole Catholic angle was brought in. I'm a lifelong Catholic--albeit a liberal one--and while I can readily admit that the Church has an antiquated way of thinking on many touchy subjects, it's also been more progressive as of late, thanks to Pope Francis. So, I was wary about it being made into a scapegoat of sorts, but lo and behold, it wasn't. I should have had more faith in the authors because they took it in a pleasantly surprising direction. As an aside, the term ""pastor"" threw me off since it's one I've never heard used in Catholicism but Google informed me that it is used in the US for parish priests. Go figure.

Three books into this series and I still can't tell who between Christina Lee and Nyrae Dawn are writing which parts, and that's a testament to how seamlessly these two seem to work as a duo. Just like the two before it, their third endeavor tugs at your heartstrings when it comes to the personal back stories of the main characters while giving you romance and sex that are super swoon-worthy. But I must say, this is probably them at their best together. The prose was enthralling and the story with a balanced mix of dramatic angst and lighthearted witticisms.

Joelle is escaping an abusive relationship by jumping in a box car on a freight train.  She arrives in Tanglewood with nothing but the clothes on her back.  Its cold and rainy when Zach spots her stealing his brother Jesse's coat outside their house.  They catch her and can't help but want to help her after she apologizes and they hear her story.  They offer her help, clothing and a room to stay in.  They are both attracted to her but have an unspoken vow to keep their hands off her.

1032,"I discovered Marie Force's Fatal series last year.  While in some respects the series reminds me of J.D. Robb's Eve Dallas series (strong, independent female cops as heroines who both work homicide with drop-dead handsome, powerful spouses, both hero and heroine with a vulnerable side), each series is unique and stands on its own.  (I do love the fact that Marie Force has allowed Sam to bring a son into the family unit!) In this book the heroine Sam has been suspended for punching a fellow cop (a swarmy b------ who totally deserved it) when an unexpected encounter with a young man outside of police headquarters drops a new case in her lap -- when police work is supposed to be off-limits.  She initially attempts to look into the young man's concerns on her own to see if there's any truth to his claims, but the situation rapidly grows to epic proportions because of the powerful personalities who might be guilty of kidnapping.  This one picks right up where the last book left off, and all the favorite secondary characters at the police station are present.  The plot is fast-moving and suspenseful.  You just have to keep reading, trying, along with Sam, to figure out exactly what is going on and how the puzzle pieces fit.

All the major cities of Europe are where the refugees of the Africa and third world European and Asian third world countries head towards.  Like in America, they drift towards the jobs that no one else wants.

Okwe (Chiwetel Ejiofor) drives cabs during the days and is the night clerk for a tourist hotel at night.  Okwe is a doctor from Lagos.  He is a political fugitive and was framed for the murder of his wife.  He is sharing a flat with one of the maids, Senay (Audrey Tautou).  She is a refugee from Turkey.  Her hope is to eventually immigrate to New York City.

One night the hotel hooker, Juliette (Sophie Okonedo) reports to Okwe an overflowing toilet in the room that she just used.  Okwe goes to the room and dislodges a human heart from the toilet.  He report it to the hotel manager Senior Juan (Sergi Lopez).  But he is not too concerned over it.

Complications begin to occur.  First immigration goes to Senay's apartment and finds evidence that she might be working.  That night they go to the hotel but Okwe is able to warn her.  Now she must find another job.  When Okwe goes to pick up her final pay from the hotel, he runs into a Somolian man and his son in the manager's office.  The son has an infected wound from a kidney removal.  Okwe puts it all together that the manager is in the black market organ business.

With immigration after her, Senay cannot get a job and agrees to sell her kidney for a passport.  Okwe agrees to perform the operation for a passport for himself.  But he has something more in mind.

This is a film of unusual insight and passion.  This is a great film that shows what immigrants must do to have a better life.  What it really shows is that the people who prey on the immigrants are their own.

Both Chiwetel Ejiofor and Audrey Tautou give compelling performances and director Stephen Frears gives up one of his truly personal films that demands to be seen.

5774,"I am so discouraged... a perfectly sweet and wonderful story was corrupted with a totally unnecessary explicit sex scene. The additional one, of the marriage night, may have passed as slightly explicit but still unnecessary.

With that said, this was a well-written story of the struggles of a gallant man, Radford Grayson, who daily struggles with post war distress. After his three year old daughter is abused by a nanny he goes back home to raise her near family and friends. He pledges her safety to her and himself.

He was raised very close to his three brothers. They owned and built a saw mill with their father. After the father's death right at the end of the Civil War, Rad could not settle because of the trauma he was living. Now, three years later, his younger brother cannot seem to welcome him back. He assigns Rad to help build the livery of their close friend and father of the brother's fianc, Evelyn.
Readers will relate to post war syndrome, many of the every day struggles of individuals to succeed and still be able to have life outside of work.
The story flows in a manner which 'pulls the reader in'. One can feel the intensity of emotions, thoughts and feelings.

The past book cover was more applicable to the story than the new revised one. It was also more appealing to the eye.

The characters in the story will become alive to the reader. The development of supporting scenes are very well-portrayed.

Jack Lonergan (played by Daniel Craig) wakes to find a metallic cuff/weapon on his arm and no memory of who he is or how he got there. As he struggles to remember, he finds that he has to protect the world from an unknown threat. Along the way, he must align himself with Woodrow Dolarhyde (played by Harrison Ford) a greedy cattleman whose sole job seems to be protecting his spoiled son, some superstitious Indians who blame the white men for this new threat, and the beautiful/mysterious Ella (Olivia Wilde) to defeat a new threat, aliens seeking gold.

The pros of this movie: There were some amazing and established actors involved. The setting (in the Old West) was extremely compelling. After all, what more could you ask for than a battle between the aliens and the earthlings......laser-like weapons against Old West weapons (i.e., arrows and guns)? There were plenty of gunfights....some you simply got lost in the battle scenes and scenery. There were even men on horseback fighting aliens in fast moving space vessels. The special effects were great and in and of themselves worth a 4.

The cons of this movie: With so much talent available to this director (Craig, Ford, Wilde, and several more), it was the plot that lacked real bite.  I felt that gold seeking aliens was (for lack of a better word)... pretty lame. Why would aliens who have access to any and everything, want earth's gold? I mean I would have rather the aliens wanted us for food (which isn't original but more likely) or the desire earth's most valuable resource, water like a lot of other movies and novels. Really I would have appreciated them wanting anything but our gold. It seemed that the aliens could have arrived on earth and taken secretly what they wanted without snatching humans and turning them into mindless beings. I don't know, I just thought that while I didn't expect this movie to win an Oscar, with the caliber of actors involved, it could have been better.",1,"[-3.3525473166775415, -1.7310597827244112, -0.9088958328340225, -0.9838991207731329, -1.5928709566090435]",-0.9088958328340225

The main character of the present-day story, genealogical detective Jefferson Tayte, is a bookish, quiet man who binges on bags of Hersheys to alleviate the stress of flying or the intensity of his research. His clients come to him because of one thing: he finds people. In this story, his female client discovers at age 60-something that she was adopted & asks JT to find her mother, Mena. So half the novel is Mena's story, who was a teen in Britain during WWII. The odd thing is, one day Mena left home & was never seen again.

I'm just now getting into Mystery/Crime/Thriller novels.  This book did not disappoint. After reading The Accounting, I will make it a point to back and read other William Lashner novels.

A teenage crime that everyone had long forgotten comes back to haunt Jon and his friends. A true tale of what is done in the dark, always comes to light even if its twenty-five years later. As the body count rises realizes one should never come between a drug dealer and his money. Jon finds out if a change in identity can save him from his past.

Poor Josephine. Her life is a cautionary tale about the importance of financial planning, Wyatt's rootless existence as a saloon-keeper and gambler left her as a lonely and practically penniless widow, relying on the kindness of relatives to survive.

9650,"I decided to add this to my arsenal in trying to catch the river rats that have been hanging around our cars and building nests in the engine compartments -- and eating the wiring.  Our property in Southwest Florid is bordered on two sides by wetlands, protected areas that must be maintained as wild habitats.  Unfortunately the snakes, hawks, and owls can't seem to keep up with the rat population.  I have used various Victor traps, sticky boards, and poisons with some success.  But even though the poisons are most effective, I am aware of secondary poisoning and therefore limit their use as much as possible.

So I decided to try this Havahart.  I ALWAYS put on a new pair of surgical gloves when handling any type of rat catching tool since the little buggers have an excellent sense of smell.  I put bird seed on the catch platform and also dribble some bird seed outside the front of the trap.  Then I arm the trap and check it the next morning.  The first day I had no success, not surprising to me since rats seem to be a little leery of anything new in their environment.  Of course there may still have been some human scent in the area.

The second day I was greeted by the squeaking of a pair of river rats in the trap, and on the third and fourth days I captured another one.  The biggest problem I have in this heat and humidity is keeping the trapping mechanism loose and fluid without using any type of oil.  Even though it is ""rust resistant"", there isn't much that won't rust in Southwest Florida.  So I rub the arms of the working mechanism with peanut oil or olive oil, something that smells natural to them yet keeps the mechanism working smoothly and effectively.

Asher is an up and coming congressman who is on the ballot to become a Senator.  Asher is also the older brother of Jennys best friend, Molly.  Although they have been friends for years, dangerous events develop that influence a significant change in their relationship.

When Asher comes home from campaigning, he finds a recent picture of Molly and Jenny taped to his refrigerator that indicates that someone had been watching them during their trip to Disney World.  Someone has been threatening Asher for weeks and now they have set their sights on his sister Molly and his secret crush Jenny.  He rushes to their side along with the FBI and decides that he wants to take an active role in keeping them safe.  More importantly, he decides that he can no longer hide his pent-up feelings for Jenny.

As the stalker amps up his threats, Asher and Jenny increase the heat between them.  Its clear that their attraction to each other had been suppressed for far too long.  The mystery behind the stalker is just as intriguing as their journey to become closer together.  It is great to see that there is a good balance between all the drama that ensues.  More importantly, Titan also gets involved.  If you don't know anything about Titan, you need to read the previous books/novellas to truly understand whats going on.  I highly recommend them all.

I have found a new author to follow.  I love it.  This was a well written with a unique storyline and characters that were perfect together.  It was a emotional story and with each scene you read,  you can fell the torture that Sam and the other shifter went through and the torture that Layne is going through to find a cure, not for herself, but for other people who have that same generic diseases.  I want to read more by this author.

3726,"The Crown of Stones: Magic-Price, by C. L. Schneider, is the first book in a three book fantasy series and the debut title by this author.  This piece of work is completely spellbound and hypnotizes the reader immediately within the start of the story by drawing to the forbidden that is difficult to deny.

Ian Troy is a Shinree  slaved people who have an addiction to magic.  He was bred to be a slave, with his magic suppressed.  His life is not his own and he relegated to serve as a soldier within the Rellan army.  Ian decides to defy orders and turns to magic, the Crown of Stones which is a Shinree relic.  In utilizing the Crown of Stones, Ian pays a horrid price for its use.  Years later, Ian is now a bounty hunter in exile and his past is about to make a crash right back into the present.

This type of book is not one that I typically read, but I was captivated by the storyline.  Upon beginning to read the first chapters, I do not know why I was hesitant.  C. L.  Schneider has a fantastical writing style that speaks to the readers and draws in other readers who may not necessarily be keen to this type of story.  The story line is unique and masterful with an elaborate adventure interwoven within the pages.  The characters grow as the story progresses adding more dynamic into them.  The world here is an escape from reality in a magical and mystical journey. This is a book I would recommend to any individual that reads this genre or anyone is considering.",3,"[-2.002357233538632, -1.22680855213932, -0.981167196338981, -1.0044787445315808, -0.9117711117397417]",-0.9117711117397417
6877,"Stand & Deliver (Men of Haven #5) by Rhenna Morgan
4.5 stars
M/F romance
I was given this book for an honest review by Wicked Reads.

This is another great story about the Haven brothers. I really would suggest reading the previous books in this series, as there are several characters and relationships that will make more sense if you have a background.

Beckett is a guy who takes what he wants without really question...however, he has found his match in his co-worker, Gia. She is a tough, independent woman who can hold her own in their business of protecting people. He has lusted after her since she first saw her, but because Gia was firm in her no dating co-workers, he's lusted from afar. He also has a revolving door of women than he brings to their get togethers after work, so he has never truly left that open for Gia to consider, since she didn't want to be part of his harem.

Gia is a woman who is amazing at her job. She has lusted after Beckett for the whole time she's worked with him...three years. But, she is a firm believer that you don't date co-workers. On a night when she has had a little too much to drink, she reveals a more vulnerable part of herself to Beckett and despite not really remembering that, Beckett shows her that he's not willing to wait any longer.

When trouble starts brewing for Gia's career, Beckett and his brothers band together to show her what a family truly is. Gia's family life definitely leaves something to be desired, but when she sees Beckett's family, how much love they have for each other, she knows that being a part of that isn't bad.

The mystery behind this story was much more satisfying for Gia and Beckett. The catharsis in this story is amazing and I felt vindicated for Gia. I wish that we would have known more about the fall out of that, but maybe if there are going to be more books, we will see a little more in to that aspect. Let's just say that I do hope that there are more books to come as they are entertaining, hot and have a lot of action.",4,"[-3.8193205031483686, -0.9118082499785933, -1.2849185115983903, -0.9637137048090028, -1.1244294392390786]",-0.9118082499785933

When Jordan left the Marines he got a job with Pierce Securities. But since he's a newbie, he's given the worst assignments. Because he had been on so many missions in the military, he thought these menial jobs were a waste of his experience. When he finally got a missing persons case, he hoped to show his boss how good he was. But he knew it wouldn't be easy since the police hadn't gotten anywhere with finding the woman who had been kidnapped from her apartment.

Mia and Jordan lived across the hall from each other and while Mia thought he was hot, she didn't do relationships. So a night or two with him is all she wanted. It looked like a couple of nights wasn't enough for either of them though. When he saw Mia being taken, he'd do anything to find her.

Jordan was not happy being out of the military and working at the security company. He really thought he was too good for the jobs he was given there. That made him hard to like and I wanted to slap him upside the head to knock some sense into him. But he was hot and that was all Mia was looking for. Mia was working hard to save enough money to bring her sister to live with her, leaving no time for a relationship. Both Jordan and Mia were surprised that their agreed upon casual sex turned into more. It didn't take long before I liked both of these people.

The book chronicles the rise and fall of the Irish gang of the same name that was every bit as bloodthirsty as John Gotti's more famous crew.  The gang occupied New York City's since regentrified Hell's Kitchen neighborhood.  Mystery author Lawrence Block effectively used the Westies lore in creating the character Mickey Ballou in the Matthew Scudder private detective series.  The fictional Ballou could be Jimmy Coonan or Mickey Featherstone, the real life chieftans of the gang, who were known for dismembering victims and dumping their bodies in the East River.

I loved how that phone connection enabled them to tell each other things they haven't (couldn't) tell anyone else.

I know a lot of readers of this series have issues when the author gives too many details of other characters, but I love that aspect of her books. It really makes me feel like I know the whole town and shows that the main characters in each book aren't living in a bubble. In this story in particular, I enjoyed the side story of Charlie and his mom. Of course, it's a great set up for the next book, too.

This book was just an okay read for me. With all the teasers and the blurb of the book, I have been waiting to read this story for a while. The story did have a nice flow and good chemistry between the two main characters, as well as the secondary characters. The other books written have dark issues, but there are those moments that are funny, which lighten the mood up and break up the darkness. I do not feel like this story had those moments.

When I went to visit my mother-in-law in Florida, I discovered that she had purchased a medical alert bracelet that required an Internet connection. The main unit for the medical device, required that the single Ethernet cable she had, be plugged into the back of the unit. Since I wanted to use my laptop computer, and there was no wireless connection available, I wasn't sure what to do. My brother-in-law, who lives in the same condo complex, let me use his computer to search for something on Amazon that would solve the problem. After searching for a while; I came across this Ethernet switch made by Lynksys and made the purchase.

Setting it up couldn't have been easier. First I plugged the Ethernet switch into a wall outlet. Than, I removed the main Ethernet cable from the medical device and plugged it into port number one on the switch. Next, I plugged the medical device into port number two. Finally, I plugged my laptop into port number three. The only extra items that I had to purchase were two 6' Ethernet cables which I used for the medical device and my laptop computer. The entire set-up took less than 5 minutes and the results were exactly what I had hoped for. I'm able to use my laptop computer at the same time that my mother-in-law's medical device is in use.

OMG, the descriptions/nightmares here were vivid--just a heads-up), twelve years later. This one deals with two of the survivors, Liv and Finn; the only other survivors we meet are all women (Rebecca, Kincaid, and Taryn) so presumably their SOs will not be fellow survivors...? Though I could be wrong--time will tell.

Anyway...

The four women, who hadn't been particularly close before the shooting, came together afterwards and at one point before graduating and going their separate ways, wrote letters to be opened in ten years in which they each pledged--to themselves and to honor their classmates who didn't ""get away""--to do certain things with their lives. They all missed the decade mark, but when they are brought back to town for a documentary about their experience, the woman who had custody of the letters brings them with her. Over drinks, the four of them read their letters out loud and decide what they have or haven't accomplished (with not a little bit of justification and hedging on some of their parts--and a teensy bit of cringing, too ;))

Liv's pretty sure she doesn't actually need to go through with her younger self's plans--and absolutely sure that she doesn't need to pick things up with Finn where they left off (she was from the wrong side of the tracks, and his father was very controlling and not terribly nice, to put it mildly, so theirs was a secret relationship) but of course fate--and Ms. Loren--have other ideas. I loved watching Liv and Finn as they reconnected, came to terms with their pasts, and figured out a way that they could move together into a future--second chance romance at its best :)

I'm not sure how this managed to be my first book from Ms. Loren, but it absolutely won't be my last! Rebecca's story is next--can't wait!

30,"For years, I have heard reviews and raves about this book, referred to as the Yoga Bible. I finally set out to read it. The first chapter, the overture to the book, is very deep - B.K.S. Iyengar's view into enlightenment and freedom of all earthly possessions and desires. It certainly is not something I plan to pursue or practice any time soon, but it is good knowledge to have. He then proceeds to break down every yoga pose - or as many as can fit in this book - describing the technique, the benefits, and a rating of easy-difficult (1 to 60). Most semi-difficult poses are about an 8 so he is very ambitious. I do disagree with him on no inversions during menstruation, esp. when he provides absolutely no proof or reason. For a long time, I observed this as most yoga teachers preach it too but without any reason. My current teacher told me simply that it was a chauvinistic idea and to disregard it altogether. Inversions during menstruation are just fine, and unless proven or advised otherwise for a reason, I plan to do them.

A pure pleasure to read;  even though I found some parts emotional at times, this in no way distracted from the overall story.  Tyler and Katie have to battle a lot in their relationship.  Both have gotten over a recent drug problem, but they have more heartache to bear;  this throws them both into relapses for totally different reasons.  Rob, Tyler and Sarah become separated as children and are put into foster care;  their lives up until that time being unimaginable.  The three eventually reunite, and Rob and Tyler become famous as part of the same band, Trouble  but they have to keep it a secret that they are siblings.  They have an image to maintain, which would be destroyed if knowledge of their past, or their family, is revealed  their secrets are too horrific.  Catherine, Robs ex-wife, is out for revenge and eventually their past secrets are revealed to the world;  as well as some even they know nothing about.

I can definitely see where quite a few of the storylines for certain episodes came from and it was a well written, interesting read.  In the end though, I found myself thankful for the life I've led.  Some reviews have stated that the experiences related in the book are just 'real life' and for some people I'm sure this is true, however, it's no life I've ever been a part of.  There is a lot of sadness, loneliness, and not very self aware individuals showcased in this book.  I found myself feeling badly for so many of them.

1190,"Three teen killers on a rampage in Minnesota. Law enforcement unable to find them. Locals roiling with fear and outrage as the murder spree continues to claim victims. No doubt about it, Minnesota authorities are furiously engaged in the pursuit of unpredictable killers, both officers and citizens enraged by the bold crimes, everything pointing to a bad ending for Jimmy Sharp, Becky Welsh and Tom McCall. The only calm voice in the middle of chaos is Bureau of Criminal Apprehension agent Virgil Flowers, who liaisons with notoriously hardcore Sheriff Lewis Duke of Bare County, where the parents of the killers live. Virgil wants to keep the young miscreants alive, working concurrently on a murder theory that triggers another, more complicated investigation dependent on the collaboration of the most impulsive of the youths, Jimmy Sharp. Jimmy's homicidal impulses are enthusiastically applauded by girlfriend Becky Welsh, Tom McCall a participant in the trio by convenience, dragged into the drama by the lovers.

Flowers is cast in the same mold as Sandford's popular Lucas Davenport, albeit a younger version, Davenport the star of Sandford's ""Prey series"" and now Virgil's boss. Like his mentor, Flowers is tall, handsome, rugged and familiar with the part of the state where the murders take place. His prose as vigorous and entertaining as in the Prey novels, Sandford builds the tension of a final confrontation through chapters describing the young killers and their victims and the unfolding conflict between what Virgil needs to happen when the three are caught and Sheriff Duke's intentions for the spree killers. With a little romance on the side- a common Virgil Flowers stress-reliever- the plot remains tight and focused, the author skillfully avoiding an anti-climactic ending while delivering non-stop action to the last page. Written with the same energy and imagination of his early novels, Sandford has a surfeit of material for future installments, the BCA lawman following the large footsteps of his storied supervisor, embellishing the thriller with his own skill set and idiosyncratic behavior.

His world crashed  that night ten years ago and he felt as though he did not deserve any personal happiness and to punish himself, he became a recluse devoid of human contact except for a few trusted employees. So when one became gravely ill, the woman who became like a mother to him, he was forced to allow her daughter Brynley Winters on his palatial compound.  Her quick tongue and twisted sense of humor  was what Weston Wilcox needed to have the incentive to come out to just the real world.

433,"In his terrific speculative thriller, Fatherland, Robert Harris plopped us down in  the middle of an alternate reality where Nazi Germany had won a stalemate with the United States and  Hitler was about to celebrate his 75th birthday in 1964.  The book was plausible and very exciting,  but best of all it confronted readers with the similarity between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union  and implicitly asked why the west fought one and aided the other.  Now, in Enigma, he shows that he  can work equally effectively against the backdrop of actual events and still broach big ideas.
It's February, 1943 and Tom Jericho, a brilliant young Cambridge mathematician and protg of Alan  Turing, has already suffered one nervous breakdown under the pressure of working to break secret  Nazi codes.  Now he's summoned back to Bletchley Park because the U-boat code, known as Shark,  which was previously decrypted due to an epiphany of his, has suddenly been changed just as an  enormous supply convoy from America is setting out for Britain.  Despite his delicate mental state, it's  felt that he'll be valuable just for his totemic value and to reassure the higher-ups that all the best men  are working on the problem.
Complicating matters is the disappearance of Jericho's ex-girlfriend, Claire Romilly, who it appears  may have tipped off the Germans that their codes had been cracked.  At any rate, some must have  betrayed this vital secret, and, even as the supply convoy sails towards one of the biggest U-boat  wolfpacks ever assembled, Jericho sets out to discover who the traitor is and where Claire has  disappeared too.
The author too manages a difficult feat as he balances the mystery plot with healthy dollops of WWII  history and cryptographic technique.  Jericho's quest for Claire is exciting enough, but it's the details  about the Enigma machines, which produced what the Nazis believed to be an unbreakable codes, and  the British success in breaking them anyway, which really make for fascinating reading.  Then, as if  that weren't enough, when Harris introduces the reason that someone at Bletchley would assist the  Nazis, he returns to some of the troubling moral and geopolitical questions that he first raised in  Fatherland.  It all makes for a thoughtful thriller that entertains, enlightens and provokes the reader.

As she tries to sort out her life and come to terms with her ex-boyfriend now engaged with her mortal enemy, she stumbles upon the dead body of tv chef, Chef Zoltan Farnsworth. Chef Zoltan waa unfortunately one of those that she nearly poisoned in Atlanta and it looks like the police are seeing Andy as a person of interest. In order to clear her name Andy starts to investigate with the help of sexy newcomer, Malcolm Jones, half-brother to her enemy, Lizzie.

Ive read two of Jennifer Harts other books (Skeletons in the Closet and Final Notice) and have enjoyed her combination of mystery, humor and romance immensely. In her newest novel, she shows why she is one of the best new cozy mystery authors. She introduces readers to the Buckland family, an Italian family that loves to cook pasta so much that they run a Italian restaurant. This family puts the fun in dysfunctional and they are a laugh a minute. I particularly loved Andys Great Aunt Cecily, whose answer to everything is we make the pasta! Add in a murder to the mix and the result will be a cozy mystery that you will be remembering fondly long after you turn the last page.

As with most cozy mysteries there is a subtle romantic element. In between solving the murder, Andy has her hands full with the sexy Malcolm Jones, a photographer with a interesting history and complete with a sexy New Zealander accent. The only catch is Malcolm is the half-brother of Lizzy, who Andy has been in not-so-friendly competition since their school days together.

Murder Al Dente was a fabulous debut in this new series. It hit all the right notes with me, and the pasta recipes are to die for. I cant wait to get into the kitchen and see if I can make the pasta just like Great Aunt Cecily and Andy! If you're looking for a new series to read this summer, I highly recommend this one.

7078,"Maggie's dream is being an Olympic swimming champion and she's willing to do anything for it. That also means she's giving up most of her regular teenage experiences. Maggie has never has a boyfriend and she also never hooked up with someone, something her friends have all done. She's interested in boys, but it doesn't seem to happen. That's why she has a plan, she'll ask her best friend Levi to give her some lessons, so she'll have experience next time she's with a guy. Is this a wise thing to do and will their friendship survive this idea?

When Maggie starts to develop feelings for Levi she knows she's in over her head. Levi is also on the swimming team and has the same goals when it comes to his career. Maggie isn't good at shutting out her feelings when she's at a swimming match, so her moods influence her results. Will being with Levi have a positive or a negative effect on her swimming? Will she be able to swim fast enough to be able to go to the Olympics and will her heart remain in one piece in the process?

Coming Up for Air is a great story about love, lust and swimming. Maggie can swim really fast and reaching her goals is incredibly important to her. When she realizes she's missed a lot of experiences others her age do have because of chasing this dream she asks her best friend Levi for help. They're really sweet together and their friendship is deep and meaningful, so this is quite a risk. I was anxious to discover what would happen between them and couldn't turn the pages quickly enough to find out.

Miranda Kenneally has written a fantastic honest story. I love the open way she writes about feelings, sex and not wanting to be the only one without any experience.

I love how she describes the thrill of being in the pool and fight for that desired time while true love is blossoming.

9224,"Ah......, how could you not miss the fifties with all those sci-fi/horror films about mutant bugs - animals - or - people genetically altered into something monstrous by over exposure or ingestion of radioactive material.

Such is the plot in the '57 low budget bugfest 'Beginning of the End.' An immense swarm of grasshoppers get into an experimental site using radioactive feed to enhance plant growth in order to increase the size of fruits and vegetables. An altrustic scientific project to provide alternative food supplies in the event of any future food shortages. However good intentions don't always produce positive results, as in this case.

You guessed it, the grasshoppers chow down on the plant food and before long begin to grow to the size of a school bus. Fortunately their wings don't develop in keeping with their new body size so they can't fly, but unfortunately with their ever increasing need for food they decide to focus on the nearest human for their next meal.

Imagine tens of thousands of gigantic grasshoppers covering the landscape as the march towards the next population center in search of fast food to go. Pretty scary don't you think? Who can ever forget that impressive battle scene when the U.S. Army take on the thundering herd and get wiped out. I can still hear the field commander on the walkie-talkie discribing the onslaught to General Hanson (Morris Ankrum), ""Still they come from way back! We're being cut-off!"" Chilling last words which seem to indicate that the 'Beginning of the End' really was upon us.

Great stuff, so push the start button on your DVD player and let the invasion begin! Starring; Peter Graves and Peggy Castle.

It seems to take the whole small-town-everyone-is-connected-somehow bit just a tad too far.

The author has effectively created images of this futuristic planet and its characters through both word and illustration. The diverse character development was done quite well. The Title was very well chosen and the Book Cover eye-catching and appealing.

The only problem I had with this story was a couple of brief moments it felt slightly confusing when intermingling the other dignitaries into the plot and I felt it abruptly ended prematurely. The tale led up to the monumental impact of the upcoming Magnolia festivities then ended before the occasion. It would have been much more effective to end just before the finalization of the event.

But as the authors say, this model no longer fits. (See especially pages 50-51). The world isn't static anymore. Passion alone isn't enough to create a career.

More important, we no longer have linear careers that go from A to B to C. We have what the authors all ABZ careers. Plan A is happening now; B is the backup; and Z is where we'd like to be.

We usually get there by a roundabout pattern, often with a component of serendipity. As the authors explain (p 151) serendipity can be proactive; it's about motion.

We also need to stop thinking of networking as strategic transactional interactions. It's about creating genuine relationships, helping and allowing oneself to be helped.

People on my opt-in list are probably saying, ""Cathy's been saying this for ages."" They'd be right.

At the end of book1 Katya makes a heartbreaking discovery that sends her into a tailspin of more unpredictable and sometimes impulsive decisions.
At the heart of this story is  a very young, inexperienced, woman struggling with the consequences of her behavior.
Does she continue her alter ego persona or return to her goody 2 shoes character!
The 2 men in the center of her dilemma had their own issues, and frankly I'm surprised by the outcome of this story. I felt one character got a a more positive characterization over the other one and he was just as bad.
Can trust be regained after a terrible betrayal?
Who was really playing games?
Why can't she have it all?
Why are the roles so different for men than they are for women?
As she tries to self develop, grow up, and mature we learn how critical she is of herself and I never really learned why.

2140,"""American Ulysses"" is a captivating and thorough biography of one of America's greatest and often forgotten heroes. As an amateur, Civil War historian, I appreciate the author's vivid detail and the historical accuracy of Grant's accomplishments during the war. Going beyond simple prose, the book is packed with informative maps, period pictures, and illustrations. However, for myself, the real treasure of this biography is found in the details of Grant's personal life, and the periods both before and directly after the Civil War.

Ronald C. White Jr. based this biography, in a large part, on all 33 volumes of ""The Papers of Ulysses S. Grant"". Even though I have read countless other Grant biographies, and Grant's own wonderful memoirs several times over, ""American Ulysses"" was full of surprises and new insights. Grant's relationship with his wife, Julia, and his entire family, is depicted in great detail. The author's in-depth treatment clearly reveals that Grant's marriage, family, and loyal friends were his anchor during the personal and professional challenges he weathered.

Mr. White's description of Grant's accomplishments (and frustrations) while serving under President Andrew Johnson was eye-opening. And both terms of Grant's presidency are given vivid, accurate, and (thankfully) unbiased detail. Likewise, the section on Grant's world tour was a treasure, and I found myself grateful that fate had finally given this untiring servant of the people a gift for himself.

Near the end of the book, there were tears in my eyes when reading about Grant's last day.  Mr. White not only brought Ulysses alive for me, but, more than that, helped me to see him as if he was my own friend. For that, I am extremely grateful. Surely, however, the author's greatest accomplishment is that he has given present and future generations of historians and scholars the definitive tome on the life of Ulysses S. Grant. And for that, the world is extremely grateful.",4,"[-4.389673095023714, -1.7923741726554168, -1.2548603741162023, -1.0041545566179244, -0.9238093454891407]",-0.9238093454891407
6824,"A well done treatment of a complex situation involving infidelity in marriage.  A plot that keeps the reader guessing about who is doing what to whom and what the ending will involve.  Natasha is a young lady living at the low end of middle class and eking out a living working in a coffee bar. She has no car because she cannot afford one and has to ride a bicycle to go anywhere.  One day on her way to work she is struck by a car doing damage to the bike.  The driver of the car - Nick quickly gives her a large amount of cash in order to settle the situation.  He also asks her out with her accepting.  It develops that Nick is married to Jennifer (Jen) but professes to not be in love with her any longer.  Natasha begins to fall in love with Nick since he claims that he wants to leave Jen and marry her.  To force the issue Natasha becomes pregnant and not too surprisingly Nick comes right out stating that he is very happy, he will divorce Jen and marry Natasha and acknowledge that the baby is his.

  First question is why does Jen accept the situation so easily?  And also why is she continuing to involve herself with Nick and his family.  She freely comes over to the home that Natasha shares with her husband.  She is also quite vocal in giving advice.  In a party for Nick's sister Jen is invited and while there seems to get along with the family while Natasha is treated as an unwelcome outsider.

  Nick professes to love Natasha but is away on business quite frequently.  He hires a driver to take Natasha around.  After a while the driver comes out with very broad hints that Jen is still in the picture involved with Nick.  The real force seemingly to keep Nick around is his absolute adoration of the baby born to Natasha - a little girl named Emily.  Ms. Ryder tells the story via alternating dialogs from both Natasha and Jennifer.  The reader is grabbed immediately and continually changing opinion about what will eventually happen.  The ending will satisfy almost everyone and allow the reader to feel that they have read a very interesting and challenging novel with the expectation of more of the same from Jess Ryder.",4,"[-4.381032973891116, -2.149349004749842, -1.1140480157303998, -0.9844237385546347, -0.9239919168141659]",-0.9239919168141659

The cast is excellent.  With the first episode in Series 1, your not certain what to expect.  You've the experienced, hardened sergeant and the fast-track, inexperienced DI with OCD.  You also have a case based on Jack the Ripper, which made me groan a bit as I'm very tired of that theme.  Not here, however.  Miles, the sergeant, believes in the job enough to give the DI a chance and, over time, trust and support him.  However, as every good sergeant should, he also guides him and brings him up short when he should.

Then there is Ben, the crime expert who starts as a nuisance but becomes an integral part of the time.  The show is extremely well cast, well acted and well written.

It is dark; there's no question about that.  The first series is four episodes dealing with one case; the second series is four episodes dealing with two cases and the third season is six episodes dealing with three cases.

9248,"Pretty much everyone that is likely to read this by now knows about the show.  Many probably watched it when it was originally on TV in the early 1990s.  It is the story of a doctor from NY (played by Rob Morrow) who , in order to pay for medical school, took a scholarship that required him to work for 4 years in Alaska.  He thought that he would be working in Anchorage, only to be shipped to the small town of Cicely.

The first season only had an 8 episode run (being a mid-season replacement show).  Most of the episodes in the first season dealt with the fish out of water aspect of Dr Fleischman living on the edge of the Alaskan Wilderness and his trying to get out of the contract keeping him in Alaska.  Toward the end of the season the show begins to focus on the quirky residents of the town.

The cornerstone of the show was the quality acting and writing.  The cast was truly ensemble, mainly comprised of relatively unknown actors and actresses.  It does have the feel of an early 1990s series, so some of the references in it are somewhat dated now (sharp viewers will get the dig at Twin Peaks, probably the most popular show on TV around that time) but overall the themes of the show hold up well almost 25 years later.

As for the DVD set itself, unfortunately Universal went the cheap route.  There are two double sided DVDs with 2 episodes on each side.  There are also deleted and extended scenes for each episode, but unfortunately no making of or behind the scenes features to speak of.  Also be aware that there may be discs out there that were burned incorrectly.  When I originally bought season 1, the first disc had the same episodes on both sides.

Thank you Delilah Marvelle for pushing past the boundaries and taking your readers into a story that is unique, powerful, intense, emotional and a joy to read.  For most of us we do not associate pleasure and pain as going together.  Our hero Malcolm does.  Just a warning, the prologue is very graphic and parts obscene, but it is an intricate part of the story and explains why Malcolm feels the way he does. He believes that he cannot never have a normal life with a woman because he is afraid of losing control of his desires and hurting her with obesession with pain.  He keeps tight control over himself at all times and even though he has been tempted over the years, he is still a virgin.  Then he meets Leona the heroine when he rescues her from a group of ruffians who have confiscated all her belongings to pay a debt.  She is an unwed mother who is trying to support herself and her son in a world where she is considered unfit for any employment or way to improve her son's life.  She is strong, intelligent, and feisty and will not give up.  They seem to be made for each other, except she doesn't understand why he wants her to hurt him during sex.  In steps Madame de Maitenon the orginal Mistress of Pleasure sent by a friend to help Malcolm understand and control his dark side.  This story is simply an amazing, deeply personal look to into a side of pleasure that few know about and even fewer write about.

FIVE STARS
Angie Smith is for all intents and purposes hiding from her past.  She has let go of it all and decided to move on to bigger things and left everything and everyone behind, or has she?  This story is full of erotic sex scenes and is not at all recommended for anyone under the age of 18.  Dual POV/ MF/ MFM/ BDSM .  Lots of sex and kink.  Love Triangle
When her boss at the law firm Kamii and her husband asked her to keep an eye on their club while they were on maternity leave, Angie had no idea what she was getting herself into but the thought of sex, and sex with no strings with strangers really turned her on.
Some of the other main characters in this book have things that they are hiding and running from as well,  Cole is a law instructor by night and a law associate by day.  Carter is a pedatric doctor, who is running from his own memories and past.
When they all collide, Carter recognizes the person that Angie used to be.  Can he walk away from her?
This book is full of twists and turns and the more the back story unfolds, the more sucked in you get.  Will Carter get his girl?  Has Angie gone too far with Cole?  What will happen with she realizes who the masked men are?
Awesome book.  Keeps you guessing what is going on in their minds.

When her best friend goes missing, she ups the moving date by two weeks and goes to the small town. Sunny doesn't know it, but she's moved into a community of were-shifters. They don't want humans in their small town. Especially one who arrives a couple of days before the full-moon-the only night of the month the shifters take their pure animal forms.

He is under the care of Vee, a woman with enough of her own problems who takes him in in large part for the meager financial benefits that come with caring for him.

Crooked Hearts is a lovely book filled with heart and a love story involving this very odd couple. They are not also strictly ethical in their approaches to the many, many problems they encounter, but they are indeed creative and innovative, and they grow stronger for each others influence. The story is deeply human, and the characters of Noel and Vee are truly attractive (in the sense that I think most readers will be rooting for them). Moreover, the book has a sense of heart and survival, even if it is tinged with acts of mischief and a sense of (sometimes) dark humor. Ultimately, its about two downtrodden people claiming some small measure of happiness amid unfair and uncertain times. Others, I see, have compared the book to Paper Moon, and I see the similarities.

3758,"It has taken me way too long to get back to the simple world that Chris Philbrook has created for Adrian. By simple I mean pretty straight forward as far as a zombie apocalypse is concerned.

Beware that this is book 2 in a series, so it might do you some good to listen to the first book first. Even thought I believe that Alone No More can stand by itself if need be.

At first I was taken aback, because this book started in the past. With things that we did not know about from book one. I had to double check that I was listening to the correct audiobook. After this initial shock I found myself getting wrapped up in the added story lines.

If you thought that Dark Recollections was missing the back story of Adrian, you will be pleased to know that Alone No More will quench some of that thirst. Not only with Adrians story but the story of several other interesting characters.

I did find it quite oxymoronic that the title is Alone no More and Adrian was alone for the majority of this story. However when people started showing up in his life again the crap hits the fan. As we all know the most dangerous things in the zombie apocalypse are the other survivors.

Philbrook ended the book at the perfect point to make you need to listen to the next in the series, something that I will be doing soon.

James Foster is simply amazing in this series. There is something magical that happens with his performance when he is Adrian talking, I mean writing, in his journal. True chemistry, he creates a real conventionality, a sincere joviality at times and disparity at others.

Now I am not sure how these two got connected, more than likely random fate or coincidence. I will choose fate because an author needs a stellar narrator to bring his vision to light. Even though Foster is a relative newcomer to the narration world, I can not think of another that would give the listener the same experience.

2097,"Not typically a reader of romance novels, particularly if there isn't some sort of mystery or suspense story to go along with it, I'm not sure why I chose to read ""Under a Summer Sky"" by Melody Carlson, other than the fact that I like Carlson's work and it takes place in Savannah, one of my favorite cities. It didn't take long to dive into Carlson's summer romance story. Nicole Anderson is a high school art teacher looking forward to a relaxing summer in Savannah, house-sitting and managing an art gallery for a family friend.

Instead of the relaxing summer she imagined, she finds she must deal with a difficult employee, a runaway teenager and two brothers vying for her affection. But, in Savannah, between the historical and incredible architecture and ghost stories, anything, even romance, can happen.

Love, love, love. I love reading stories about places I've been. Carlson's descriptions were wonderful and her story was appealing. Nicole's personality and charm was just enough to make me want to meet her in real life. She was compassionate and wise and she had a way of bringing people together in spite of themselves. I absolutely loved this story and wish it never had to end. It made me yearn to visit Savannah again.

It's the story of young love and so much more.  Rune is the new boy in town and moves next door to Poppy.  They instantly become best friends and soul mates.  Poppy is given a jar from her dying grandmother and told to fill it up with kisses from that special boy.  Her first kiss put in the jar is from Rune but will all her kisses be one with Rune?  When Rune's father is called back to Norway for his work, both are devastated but decide they will somehow find a way to stay connected.

When Rune arrives in Norway, he and Poppy continue to talk until one day Rune stops hearing from her.  Silence, no explanation, letters, texts, and phone calls go unanswered.  Rune is devastated and becomes sullen and refuses to speak to his family and little brother.

Upon the family's return to Blossom Grove, Georgia things don't return to normal.  Rune is still angry and Poppy won't tell him why she was silent for two years.  As he finds out the truth, a truth that leaves not only Rune devastated but me as the reader it becomes clear that Poppy may not be able to fill her jar up.  Rune though, decides to make sure that jar will be filled.  He learns he must forgive his family for uprooting his life and move on to a future that may or may not be with Poppy.

Aleksei and Kate's story is a quick fun read.  The transformation of the characters from the beginning of the story to the end was very satisfying.  Both had their insecurities and vulnerabilities, but grew from them due to the other person giving them what they truly needed.  It was a beautiful hinge to read as Aleksei grew to love and see how important Kate was to him.  And it was nice to see Kate mature, get a little self-confidence and go for what she wanted.

Henry's father has a new family now and Henry hasn't got the feeling that he's a part of it. He belongs with his mother. She doesn't leave the house very much, sometimes it takes weeks before she even goes out to buy groceries. She tells Henry stories about the past and about life and he patiently listens to everything she has to say. He knows his life isn't standard and that he isn't a great sportsman and thus not very popular, but he doesn't mind. The only thing he wants is for something to happen and his wish does come through when he meets Frank. Frank needs help and Henry and his mother are the people who are giving it to him. Frank teaches Henry a lot of useful things in the few days they are spending together. He changes Adele completely and she finally comes out of her shell again. In the few days before Labor Day Frank makes both the lives of Henry and his mother a lot better. Henry has a lot of very important lessons to learn that summer and some of his actions have grave consequences.

The atmosphere in the house where Henry lives with his mother is tense. Henry has to be the responsible one as his mother clearly isn't able to be there for him in the way she should be. He knows that and because he loves her he accepts her the way she is. His relationship with his father is a difficult one and they aren't very close even though they see each other regularly. Frank understands Henry and Adele which is wonderful. Even though he's got a troubled background Henry and Adele don't judge him and let him tell his own story. I liked that a lot. Labor Day is such a beautiful story with special people in it. They're all broken in some kind of way, which makes them even more interesting. Love plays an important role for every main character, which is such an important message. I also liked seeing into the mind of Henry, it gives the story something extra.

3883,"This book hooks you right from the start when Josie Blairs mother wants her to go to Dorset Falls and take care of her great uncle who was injured in a car accident that also killed his wife. Not only does Josie have to take care of her uncle, but she needs to settle his wifes business affairs which include a knitting shop.  She has her work cut out for her.

As soon as she arrives, she is made to feel like an outsider starting with her ornery great uncle. Everyone in town makes sure she realizes shes not welcome. They want her sell the knitting shop and go back home to New York City. Josie does manage to find a couple of friends along the way.

However, things take a nasty turn when a dead body is found in the knitting shop and members of the town council make it clear they want Josie to sell the shop immediately. It's obvious to Josie that someone is hiding something and she intends to find out what that something is.

Josie Blair is the newest amateur sleuth to hit the cozy mystery genre and she makes a great first impression. I loved how she stood up to her great uncle and never backed down even when he clearly didn't want her help. In fact, she didn't back down from anyone, not even those who wanted her to leave Dorset Falls immediately.

The pages flew bywell, I read this on my Kindle so the pages were swiped by. LOL I couldn't put this down until I found out whodunit. It wasn't a total shock, but it was interesting to see how the story unfolded.

The author has given readers an excellent beginning to a great new cozy series. Shes given cozy lovers everything they could want  a strong amateur sleuth, mystery and even a bit of humor woven through the story. Im looking forward to another visit to Dorset Falls.

2597,"Tortured Skye: A Hawke Family Novel (The Hawke Family Book 2) by Gwyn McNamee 5 stars

Please, please, please read Savage Collision (Book 1) first. This is one of those series that you really want to read in order. Also, please note that in my first review I said Savage was my new book boyfriend, well Ive moved on. Gabe Anderson is now my book boyfriend (Sorry Savage).

Skye Hawke has had some tragedy in her life and has worked like the dickens to overcome and move on. Its not easy and everyone looks at her just a little differently. Skye is a grown woman who still has some bratty tendencies. She is a professional in the work place and is still trying to find her new place in her family. Her new reality is a little hard for her to take sometimes because of guilt and part of her soul being missing.

Gabe understands about soul connections because he and her brother Savage have a similar connection. Herein lies the problem. Skye is Gabes best friends little sister. Ruh roh - you see where this is going, right? Gabe served several tours of duty, suffers from PTSD as well as a few other issues and tries really hard to work on himself and move on in his life. He knows right from wrong and struggles with decisions.

I was so excited to read this book. I just knew there was a story behind Gabe and what makes him tick. I was not disappointed in even one page of this story.

Once again, I go on record as saying Gwyn McNamee must be a pen name. Her sophomore book does not read as someone who is still honing her craft. If this really IS only her second book as a writer, I cannot imagine how awesome Stones book will be. I will wait patiently for the next book in The Hawke Family Series.",4,"[-2.8357592153570925, -1.424406708663967, -1.1624170787275676, -0.99804882769636, -0.9371329361156294]",-0.9371329361156294
1985,"Elizabeth Vaughan crafts a satisfying conclusion to her Chronicles of the Warlands trilogy, with this installment that brings the Warlord and his Warprize back to the Heart of the Plains.  This is definitely more engaging than the last book, though the original Warprize holds up as the strongest installment.  This is not a standalone new readers need to start at the beginning of the series.

What I like about this book is that it gives Lara a chance to fight for her man. You see, we find out here that there is much Keir has kept to himself about what awaits them in his homeland. He and Lara must be separated, so other warlords have the chance to court her. And if that weren't bad enough, she must stand trial before the Elders to see if she is a worthy Warprize.

Its hard for Lara to be apart from Keir, but this really gives us a chance to see her adapt once again to a foreign environment. We get to see her weave her magic over new strangers and it reminded me why I liked her character so much in the beginning. In fact, its the fantastic character development across the board that really make these books so good. Yes, I cared about Lara and loved my her warlord, Keir.  I also loved Marcus and her relationship with him. I loved the return of Simus. And Iften makes for a great villain.

The worldbuilding continues to expand as we get our first look at the Plains.  We learn even more about the culture and, later, Laras impact on it. We slide a little more into the fantasy realm with a little bit of spirit culture, but it was a touching scene and made me cry a little.

The ending definitely gives a satisfying HEA, though not every single loose end is tied up. There is a fourth book in the series, though it doesnt feature Keir and Lara as the main couple. Ill probably still read it just to get one more taste of this series I have enjoyed so much.

Would recommend this series to fans of fantasy romance.

PS  The sex gets a little steamier with each book. (*wink*)

I read the first book of this series and enjoyed it but then it sorta fell off my radar, now I have to go back and get the books between that one and this one because I have enjoyed the ones I read so much! In this book we are back in River Bend with Jenny who seems to struggle with relationships, always the friend with benefits never the girlfriend. Shes just been dumped by Reed (again) and has decided to make some changes, not settle for just sex again. Of course thats when she meets Brody who just happens to be sex on legs (I mean hes a tatted up, pierced bad boy, come on now thats just not fair). Brody has his fair share of issues too. Hes a Marine who is suffering with PTSD and who has no more experience with real relationships than Jenny has. These two are amazing together, they build each other up and make each other stronger. I loved watching their relationship develop and I loved watching both these characters grow and heal. I also enjoyed the secondary characters, both those weve seen get their HEAs and those who are yet to come. I have to say though that Reed continues to be a selfish douchebagthe author says that his story will be next and his girl makes him work for it. I personally hope she tortures him for a good long time, itll be good for him and very interesting to watch his reformation. Like I said I really enjoyed this book, it kept me turning pages and I had t read it twice already.

450,"Bernard Cornwell at his best is terrific.  He has a wonderful ability to reimagine what is not merely familiar, but rather stale.  The Arthurian Legend is a daunting task to recreate, but one definitely deserving of re-imagination.  When Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot devolve into a Lerner and Lowe musical, it's time for an extreme make over.  To be clear: I really admire the author, but not without reservation. He can drag a three part story out to seven (see the Uthred/Alfred the Great series).  Here, Cornwell actually benefits from the restrictions of the Arthurian legend, not being able to stray too far or natter on endlessly.  The Arthurian Legend also benefits from him: Cornwell pares back the overly Romanticized shlock and focuses on actual events or on events as they might have actually been.

In The Winter King Arthur's not yet king. He has no knights and he's not yet fashioned a round table.  Chaos reigns.  The Romans are gone, Britannia has disintegrated into turf warfare and Celts, Picts, Anglos, Saxons and Danes are more gangsta than government.  It is in this setting that one can imagine the yearning for security, calm and order.  Knights of the Round Table are more wishful thinking than reality; Gawains and Percivals a projection of what you're looking for from the man in charge. The idea that an unfaithful wife can disrupt the natural order of society is Romance (and misogyny)  in overdrive and has no place in this world.  Cornwell makes us understand that legend and romance are born from a riotous reality and need for security.

Whether it's what you imagine, this telling of Arthurian legend is entirely plausible, very entertaining and well worth reading.",4,"[-2.0210199530163417, -0.9891044803657668, -1.2023629417635922, -1.0405079117644376, -0.9379999018339654]",-0.9379999018339654
3268,"Adam Mitzner presents an engrossing story revolving around Jonathan Caine, a brilliant and very successful currency trader.  Jonathan has made himself a fortune trading currencies for a huge hedge fund.  He has a beautiful wife,  a multimillion dollar condo in a prestigious part of Manhattan and nothing but expectations of continuing in the same vein.  A problem crops up when a big customer suddenly gets edgy and demands that he be paid off on his investment.  The fund at that moment does not have the liquidity to pay and Jonathan has to resort to what is actually an illegal move in order to get the funds.  He is caught, fired from the fund and possibly subject to prison for the crime.
  When circumstances become bad for him Jonathan finds that he is sitting on a house of cards.  His wife leaves him, he loses the condo and he is forced to flee to his home town where he intends to care for his ailing father.  He also decides while there to attend the 25th anniversary of his High School graduation.  At this affair he meets Jacqueline Williams who was the prom queen at his graduation and did not give him a tumble at that moment.
  This time there is a mutual attraction turning into love between the two spoiled only by the existence of Jackie's husband.  The man is abusive and jealous of every movement Jackie makes, and she has thought how to get rid of him for a long time.  With nothing presenting itself and the husband refusing to let Jackie go thoughts turn finally to murder.
  The last half of the book is about what becomes of these thoughts and how Jonathan and Jackie work things out. And of course, the prison sentence hanging over Jonathan's head due to his illegal actions at the Hedge fund. The ending is very far from what the above circumstances might be in other novels causing the reader to find that he or she has been reading what is a brilliantly worked plot.

5543,"Sean Duffy has nothing going right these days.  Hes just been dumped by his girlfriend, Beth, who is ten years younger than he is.  Hes just been assigned to the protective unit for a Muhammed Ali visit to Ireland.  The story takes place in Carrickfergus which is close to Belfast.  Its the time of the Irish Troubles when the IRA is dropping bombs left and right as a protest method to gain Irish independence.  Its a bit of a far stretch to imagine how these bombs could be an asset in their goal but for now it is what it is.  So for now Detectives like Duffy check under their cars for bombs every time they set out to travel somewhere.  Ali during his tour actually turns around and confronts protestors, winning them over with his charm and panache.
But the day isn't done before there are two problems, one minor and one major.  A Finnish delegation has come to the area to check it out as a potential site for a large new business and of course the town officials want and English government want everything to proceed ultra-smoothly.  However, one of the Finnish delegation members wallet is declared missing and a young woman is found dead from a possible suicide in Carrickfergus Castle. The first is a joke; the second turns out to be a complex mystery.  Why did this young journalist kill herself?  Why did the night guard not know she was still in the Castle after closing hours?
The plot becomes quite complex when it turns out that the Finnish delegation was not as innocent as it appeared to the public.  Add to that another policeman is killed from a bomb under the car and of course everyone assumes its just another IRA plot, nothing new.  It turns out thats not so either.
Duffy for a long time keeps receiving false leads but if its one thing Duffy has a reputation for, its persistence, relentless.
Rain Dogs has many other twists and turns that keep the reader flipping the pages and rapidly reading.

The story starts off promisingly enough with Cromwell reeling in his former protege with the promise of more time for a client's defense.  The addition of Cromwell's cohort Jack Barak is a welcome one, offering ""assistance"" to Shardlake as he wends his way through London's seedy underbelly.

In fact, the addition of Barak is the best part of the story--a fine counterpoint to the more proper Shardlake.  Unfortunately, that's all the good news.  The story about Dark Fire is a bit contrived and the plot of undermining Cromwell by duping him seems rather farfetched.  The guy didn't get from nowhere to the pinnacle of Tudor power by being anyone's patsy. The parallel mystery of the Wentworth family is okay, but hardly difficult to figure out.

The best part of the series continues to be Sansom's depiction of  Tudor England.  It's dark, dangerous and all-together convincing.",2,"[-4.488959375687053, -1.8403178319661908, -1.1418107589030795, -1.032842391040778, -0.9392362463820962]",-0.9392362463820962

So its fun to read, though the plot (such as it is) turns sluggish at times.  Our astute private eye, named Sherlock of all things (and that should tip you off), fumbles his way through as complicated a plot as can be found in any murder mystery.

Sherlock isn't really intent on solving the crime, since his job is to keep the insurance company from having to pay off the multi-million-dollar policy on the victims life.  To help him in his endeavor he has the insurers daughter to help him in his task, and she provides more than a few sharp comments to aid in the investigation.

Oh, yes.  He also has partial custody of his two, very precocious pre-teen daughters to also help him along, and a bitter ex-spouse to add more color to the story.  Then finish it up with a plot so complex that only a truly dedicated mystery fan will ever have the courage and patience to try unraveling all the skeins.

The ending is very traditional, however, with all the suspects rounded up and the astute Sherlock further muddying up the already murky waters.

Euphoria the story of three anthropologists who wind up spending a brief period of time together while studying a tribe in New Guinea. Nell and Fen are married, but its clear right from the beginning that their relationship is volatile. Fen is brash, selfish and jealous of Nells success in the field of anthropology. Nell, on the other hand, is calm and thoughtful. She values freedom above all else, and would practice polygamy if she had it her way. As you can expect, when Bankson enters the scene, tensions quickly escalate.

The themes in Euphoria are fascinating and intellectually stimulating. It challenges us to wonder, for example, if its truly possible to observe or study anything without imposing our own subjectivity. It forces us to contemplate Nells hypocrisy: She doesnt want possession in her relationships, and yet she speaks about the tribe as if it is hers. It reminds us of the harmful effects of jealousy and power, both inside and outside of a relationship.

A Daughter's Dream follows A Sons Vow (which I read and liked earlier this year) and spotlights a different Kinsinger sibling, Rebecca, in a delightful romance. Now, Rebecca has the opportunity to pursue her dream to teach, which proves to be a bit more challenging than she expected, and encounters Jacob Yoder, who also faces his share of unexpected problems. Naturally and sweetly, amidst lessons of following dreams and seeking Gods will, romance develops between Rebecca and Jacob, and their story will bring a smile to any readers face.

I can easily say that A Daughters Dream offers exactly the kind of quick and heartwarming read expected from Shelley Shepard Gray. Again, I really enjoyed it and recommend it - and cant wait to see more of Charm in A Sisters Wish.

This is my first paranormal romance starring a werewolf. Logan Black is a former Marine and werewolf hired by his best friend, Jake, to protect human wedding planner Veronica Vale. Veronica is the younger sister of Leah, who is engaged to marry Jake.

Veronica has been receiving letters from a secret admirer who also happens to be a werewolf. She isn't a fan of werewolves. In fact, her sister was attacked by a werewolf about a year ago and is now a werewolf herself. Veronica loves her sister but she despises any other werewolf even though her sister is marrying one.

Logan's job is to protect Veronica from a distance but that doesn't work out so well. His attraction to her causes him to get much closer than he expected. Their relationship heats up and he doesn't get the opportunity to tell her that he is also a werewolf. Veronica's interactions with Logan and other pack members help to change her perspective regarding werewolves and she has to do some soul searching of her own. Ultimately, her journey becomes a lesson in love and the age old issues about judging a book by it's cover. I really enjoyed the book. It is part of a series but definitely stands alone.

1959,"Roseanna White is skilled at penning historical fiction! I enjoyed the Scottish elements of this particular story. The haunting setting...the clash of classes and loyalties...the interesting discussion of curses and whether or not they truly pose a threat. It's a good blend of intriguing descriptions, a compelling and varied cast of characters, and a fairly unique topic and backdrop for the genre.

The poor heroine endures some awful trials and difficult changes in this story. But the Duke of Nottingham makes for a very tender and caring hero, which makes for a happy romance reader! The depictions of patient love as the story goes on are simply lovely.

As for the plot, my first impression was that the climax was a bit of a letdown, perhaps a bit rushed compared to all the build-up. But the build-up makes for an engaging read for the most part, and I feel like the conclusion is still satisfying, even if I got a bit bored toward the end and looked ahead to see what was coming.

The Reluctant Duchess is a well-written historical romance that's both sinister and sentimental in turn. And the finale definitely stirs up some curiosity for the third book in the Ladies of the Manor series, A Lady Unrivaled.

She was professional and considerate in her chosen career even though she suffered from discrimination being a female police officer. Even Marc had his really strong and not particularly supportive opinion on the topic. It was entertaining to read how the mighty has fallen though. He just couldn't fight love. I liked how Marc was every bit of a protective alpha but let Leah take charge sometimes thus bringing them both to new heights in their relationship.

Kara, after her first day as an intern in the Mayors office returns home and cries that she had been raped by the Mayor.  Catherine who accompanies Calvin is convinced that Kara is telling the truth, but Galvin is unable to act because of the stature of the Mayor and lack of support evidence to the crime.

985,"I'm not yet sure how to take the new Harlequin KISS line. It advertises ""fresh, fun, and flirty"" yet neither of the books I've read so far really fit my definition of those terms. However, this one I did like--it just wasn't at all what I was expecting given the cover (I know--don't judge a book yada, yada; but honestly, who decided on this one? It's all lighthearted and fun, but the book is not--though in a good way.)

I ended up liking this book quite a bit--both Evie and Logan are great characters, especially once we figure out just what it is that scared Logan off so many years ago. I was pulling for their HEA, and would even have liked to have seen Logan's brother (and Evie's business partner) Max get one too. He was a lot of fun. Chances are good I'll look for more from this author, based on this book.

However, at first it was hard to get past the let's-get-married-to-save-our-company-and-divorce-later idea that Max had. It just seemed like too much of a stretch in a ""modern"" romance. However, that idea thankfully went by the wayside once Evie and Logan met up again, and then the story focused on them, as it should. I liked the reunited lovers troupe here; though it was a bit frustrating that we don't really ever see what it was that made them separate in the first place. I also was never really quite sure how to take Logan and Max's mother--sometimes she was incredibly insensitive, especially toward Logan, other times she was great. In the end I had a really hard time deciding between three and four stars.

I received a copy of The Bluebonnet Betrayal from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for my honest review.

Description From the Publisher:

Pru's life in England is coming full circle. A Texas transplant, she's married to the love of her life, thriving in the plum gardening position she shares with her long-lost brother, and prepping a Chelsea Flower Show exhibit featuring the beloved bluebonnets of the Texas hill country. Technically, Twyla Woodford, the president of a gardening club in the Lone Star State, is in charge of the London event, but Pru seems to be the one getting her hands dirty. When they finally do meet, Pru senses a kindred spirituntil Twyla turns up dead.

Although Twyla's body was half buried under a wall in their display, Pru remains determined to mount a spectacular show. Twyla would have insisted. So Pru recruits her husband, former Detective Chief Inspector Christopher Pearse, to go undercover and do a bit of unofficial digging into Twyla's final hours. If Pru has anything to say about it, this killer is going to learn the hard way not to mess with Texas.

My Review:

The characters continue to grow with this series.  Each new book brings more depth to Pru and her relationships with the other characters, both old and new.  As always Marty Wingate writes a plot that even thought it moves quickly from scene to scene it is not rushed like the rapids on a river, but rather like a gentle bubbling book that soothes.  Readers will quickly fall in love with the Potting Shed Mysteries.  The series is memorable and fun to read.

8778,"Amy Andrews' first book in her Outback Heat series was an easy enjoyable read. Having read several books from her, I have to confess I was expecting a little more steam sooner, but it mattered not as she holds the story together with a likeable cast of characters in a lovely Aussie outback setting.

""Guys do not sleep with their friends' sisters.""

The older brother's best-friend trope is one that forms a staple in my reading diet but the thirteen-year age gap between Cooper and Lacey made this a little different. Grumpy, brooding, sexy and a bit of a knight in shining armour, I liked Coop. Lacey was frustrating with her snap, immature decisions, and I confess she took a little warming to, but she's young, flighty and has three protective older brothers to contend with so she can be forgiven.

""How about you take me home to bed and you can call the shots.""

With a good chemistry, this couple fought their feelings but when they do give in they are sexy together. And with Lacey's three older, single brothers featuring throughout, I'm looking forward to seeing where Amy takes the series. 3.5 stars.

6066,"K. Bromberg has penned a lively and sexy novella filled with playful repartee, a vivacious heroine and a dreamy, tatted hero! Sweet Rivalery is a spin-off of Sweet Cheeks, the hero, Ryder Rodgers being Saylors older brother.
Since their college days, the heroes of this story, Ryder and Harper, have been rivals and challengers. In theory, they do rivalry well but there is a fine line between love and hate. Harper Denton has always been a thorn in Ryders ego, she is resilient, driven, ambitious, not to mention that she has a sharp-tongue and a red-hot temper. Ryder is a shrewd strategist, in control and charismatic but with Harper he loses his edge.
Harper and Ryder are once again in competition with one another, to win a corporate tender. Losing is not an option, but their rivalry is based on mutual respect and they both intend to play fair.

Despite the short format of this story, the characters were well developed. The focus of this novella is on their relationship. They have history and some baggage. But despite their incredible chemistry, things are complicated, there is a lot of push and pull and the sexual tension between them is at its highest point. Their competitiveness is laced with distracting lust and they both revel in their battle of wits.
I really enjoyed this short story, told in dual POV, and I will definitely read anything K. Bromberg comes up with next!

But I was immediately drawn into it. The leading character, Changez, is addressing an American he meets in a Lahore teashop (and by extension you the reader.)

Changez begins his narrative when he was a student in the US. As an outstanding Pakistani youth he got a scholarship to Princeton. Here religion doesn't seem to feature in his life at all- he aims high, mixes with his classmates, drinks, holidays, falls in love and ultimately lands a prestigious job.

This novel had a bit of everything I love and Im so pleased that I found it. This story will capture your heart with beautiful romance, keep you interested with glorious details and steamy tension, and have you pleading for more of the amazing storyline.

Ellie Bell has a history of dating the wrong men so she created a goal in order to make better choices in the future. Luckily she hasn't been tempted to break her pact at least not by anyone in person. The soldier from her brothers unit was there for Ellie when no one else was. His messages meant the world to her and she feels an intense longing wondering what happened.

Charlie Johansson is planning a relaxing leave with no drama but plenty of fun. His recent decision to change his old ways gives him hope for the future. The fiery redhead he meets in a parking lot has him second guessing these choices. Of course fate has other plans when she turns out to be his best friends younger sister, the same woman he spent months thinking about after they correspond through email.

Charlie believes she could be the one he can start over with, be a new man for until Sam introduces him as Hunter. Big Game Hunter was Charlies past and he wants to leave him there, especially after seeing the look on Ellies face when she realizes he is the player her brother warned her about. Charlie knows winning her over will be quite a challenge, especially when it seems everything is against him.

Ellie cannot help but be attracted to Hunter. The more she gets to know him, the more she believes his reputation really is the past. Thoughts of Charlies messages still linger in her mind but she slowly forgets him as she spends time with Hunter. They work so well together and appear very compatible. Ellie cant fall for another bad boy but she cant seem to stop their connection.

I loved the descriptive storyline of this book. The journey I experienced page after page was fantastic. The two identities of Charlie were exciting and added a pinch of drama. Ellies personal goal proved the pure truth of their bond. Discovering secrets and hidden elements made it like putting a puzzle together. Any romance lover will enjoy this read!

When she stumbles on a dead body, Stormi comes up with a new idea. She wants to write a romantic mystery and what better way to start then by investigating the murder she literally stumbled upon? You cant get better research than investigating the real thing.

Stormi quickly learns that investigating murders isn't all that easy. To top it all off, her mother, sister, niece and nephew barge into her new home. They move in and fast become fixtures in her house, which is now theirs. Then, she meets Detective Matthew Steele who isn't happy with her interfering in his investigation to say the least. It doesnt stop Stormi, although shed much rather date the handsome detective than argue with him.

With the help of her mother, Stormi sticks her nose in all her neighbors business and fast becomes the communitys number one nuisance. She, also, discovers that many of her neighbors had a reason to kill the victim. Now, someone seems to have a reason to want her dead. Obviously, shes making someone very nervous with what she uncovers  most likely the killer.

This is a LOL cozy mystery meets chick lit and romance. The romance is very sweet and the murder mystery has no blood or gore. The characters are lovable and the story is not very complicated, although it does take many twists and turns until we learn whodunit.  Stormi and her mother make quite a pair. I kept thinking of Lucy and Ethel from I Love Lucy. Stormi even has the red hair to match.

2946,"This is the story of Canadian, Amanda Lindhout and about how she and her Australian friend, Nigel Brennan were held captive in Somalia for 15 months. The book was both a fascinating and terrifying read, and it allows us to see how she ended up in this situation.
The book starts off with Amanda's life as she grew up in a dysfunctional family, in rural Alberta without a lot of money.
To keep herself sane Amanda would buy National Geographic magazines, from the thrift stores and daydream of taking trips to the wonderful places she would see, and read about.
Once she moved away from home and went to Calgary, where she found a job that would make her good money and afford her to travel, she would do so, until she needed to go home and save up some more. She first started in the Americas and then India, the Near East and Middle East, until deciding to go to Somalia in Africa. On one of these trips she met an aspiring photojournalist,  Nigel, with whom she fell in love, yet years later as just friends she calls and asks him if he wants to join her in Somalia to do a story and take photos, he agrees and they meet in Kenya, excited about their journey, until the fateful day that they were kidnapped by an extremist group, who wanted money.
It is amazing what the mind and body can endure when one has the will to live. You will see what they do to try and make their lives a bit better, and their copping mechanisms.
This book was very well written, and the co writer Sara Corbett did a wonderful job at helping Amanda  bring her story to life.  You will be glued to the pages.",4,"[-3.5519234252578986, -1.0248032498108635, -1.3495929234606614, -1.0072746895272136, -0.9453295246312352]",-0.9453295246312352
9245,"Stalker takes place in an unknown worldly region in a post-apocalyptic future where a meteor's impact has formed a puzzling area called the Zone.  The Zone is suppose to have mythical properties as it has forces that can lure people to their demise, but also uncover our deepest desires.  Stalkers are the only ones who can sense mysterious forces and avoid the dangers within the Zone.  Many courageous people come to the Zone with stalkers as guides on quests to fulfill their wishes.  In this film the audience is to follow three characters, Stalker, Writer, and Scientist, as they venture into the perilous Zone.  The party's venture becomes a breathtaking journey through armed guards, obscure traps, and  psychological horror.  The journey can symbolically be interpreted as a pilgrimage in order to restore ones faith and hope, which have been lost.  This pilgrimage develops into a psychosocial battle between rationalism and abstract thought as the travelers attempt to reason with hope, faith, and love.  Tarkovsky brilliantly blends his philosophical messages with visually stunning cinematography that encourages thought and analytical growth in a science fiction story that provides an enlightening cinematic experience.",4,"[-3.4277624602472327, -0.9454710107748205, -1.2001694571569232, -1.0272868987863966, -0.9782077797311013]",-0.9454710107748205

The queen uses magic to make the people of Ravenspire obey. She usurps the land and poverty and hunger are the result. Irina wants to have what she thinks is rightfully hers. Power is what she craves.

Kol is from Eldr, a neighboring kingdom. After a terrible incident he's responsible for saving his country all of a sudden. He's got a dragon form and a human form, but no magic. Because vicious ogres are attacking his country by using magic he has to find help. He wants to make a deal with Irina, but he doesn't know what she's capable of. He makes a huge mistake and Lorelai is the only one who can fix it...

The Shadow Queen is inspired by Snow White. There are some similarities, but mostly the story is original. I liked the world building. There are several kingdoms, there's magic and there are all kinds of interesting creatures. There are three different points of view, Kol's, Irina's and Lorelai's. These main characters have their own distinctive voice and background and being able to see inside their heads makes the story versatile and interesting for the reader. I loved the result, wonderfully organized chaos. There are so many fighting scenes and both magic and battle skills are being used. The Shadow Queen is an action packed rollercoaster, something I definitely enjoyed.

Irina is the typical bad queen. She's found a way to have power and she isn't afraid to use it. There's a reason behind her behavior, but I don't think anyone will have much sympathy for her. She's cruel and ruthless. It was fun to see part of the story from the point of view of the villain. I liked Kol as well. He's in over his head, but he's fiercely loyal and he's a good guy. Lorelai has to deal with a lot of guilt and a lot of power. She has to grow up way too quickly to be able to do what has to be done. It was great to witness the progress she makes. It's the tension between the main characters that makes this story so good.

2700,"""If I Forget You"" brings to mind many other stories I have read or movies I have watched. Poor boy meets wealthy girl in college. The fall in love and her wealthy parents break them up as boy is just too unsuitable for words.

I will say that I did enjoy reading ""If I Forget You"" for the most part, but I do feel that the author forgot to put some heart into the story. I could not connect with either Henry or Margot, they seemed to have no depth of character, they just were not that interesting to me.

The story was told from the perspective of both main characters and moved from present time to the college years which provides readers with the history behind their love story. While reading, I wondered why Margot decided to travel to New York to find Henry in the first place. After all those years, why now? I never did find an answer to that question and perhaps it was the intent of the author to leave the reader wondering.

It is not the most exciting read, nor is it the best love story I have read, but I did finish reading it. Perhaps the only reason I did, was to find out if Henry and Margot ended up together again. So, I can't highly recommend this read, but will say if you are looking for something to read while traveling that doesn't require a lot of attention, then pick up a copy of ""If I Forget You"".",2,"[-2.5146409849155535, -0.9468761120754385, -1.003382768556788, -0.9805667576985087, -1.4534860066361919]",-0.9468761120754385

Based on a true 20th century account, 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' chronicles the unfortunate tale of a young college girl who had the misfortune of being too sensitive and caring. Traits that apparently attract spiritual evil and can leave one vulnerable and susceptible to demonic attack and ultimately possession.

Well, when he finally had that confidence, he uses it to dig his own grave and says something completely crazy. What in the world are you saying to her???!!!!

Their chemistry is undeniable and overwhelming, they were totally meant for each other if we took all those crazy insecurities they have instilled in themselves.

Dana and Claire decide to spend their last night together at Club Zing before entering the Grown up world after College.
Claire is more reserved when it comes to men, unlike Dana.
Tyler Sterner, the owner of Club Zing and a yummy dirty talking bad boy.
Claire stumbled in to his grasp, literally and the games begin. He has had his eye on her all night, and now he is making it known.
After he offends Claire with his off the wall invites to participate in a little party of his own upstairs, she walks away agitated yet intrigued.

So imagine Claire's surprise when she is surprisingly introduced to her new stepbrother. She had no idea her mother was even dating anyone let alone, married. When she walks in to the new family home and finds Ty standing in the living room shirtless and just as yummy as the night before, she hits the floor.

Ty is crude, rude and vulgar. He had no issues with speaking his mind and dropping the F-Bomb right and left. Together Claire and Ty fight against the tension building within them, after all they are now off limits from taking it any further. I mean their parents are married which should keep them from taking things further...right?

OH MY, the heat...
As the tension continues to build and a few little hot encounters between the two take place, the final straw is drawn and Ty proves to be the tiger he proudly wears on his chest.

When things fall apart for Claire, Ty comes to her rescue and makes everything seem okay. The solution to her problem seems crazy at first but then how could she honestly resist him and his comfort. He makes everything seem better. Yes the bad boy foul mouthed boy, has now become the one person she can and has grown to rely heavily on. He may not be the jerk she had him pegged to be from the beginning he just needed to have a reason not to be such a jerk and she may be that reason.

We know him as the man that road at midnight to warn about the invasion. Paul Revere was truly a fascinating person he was lived in highly turbulent times that were difficult, and he was at the center of the difficulties with his activities in the Revolutionary war. He was active in the colonial tax fights and riots.  He was part of the Boston Massacre, Boston Tea party, the battles of Lexington and Concord, and don't forget the ratification of the US Constitution, and he did all of this while being a busienss man, and was a father to sixteen children, this man didn't do anything in a small fashion.

Miller writes about Paul Revere in such a way that he brings light to this fascinating man.  The chapters are seperated into different phases of his life.  We are told of the facts, but also the motivations behind the actions.  This was a man who was an entrepreneur that did not have an easy life.  He went through financial difficulties, fought valiantly for a country's who future was not certain, and burried a wife and a child.  The woodcuts in the novel bring charm and character giving us a real flavor of the time.

The Revolutionary Paul Revere is an undersung hero and a man who should have been a greater hero than the story books have him portrayed as.  This book is well written and takes a subject like history that can sometimes be a little dull, and quite simply breathes life into Paul Revere.",4,"[-1.3025386670197308, -1.076392671287979, -0.9494790093457584, -0.9992744837759878, -1.3841808418341235]",-0.9494790093457584

A fantasy political thriller and mystery novel with some great characters, a good plot, and some terrific world-building. The female MC is a smart, strong, but unassuming spy. Her awesome Viking-like sidekick is a larger-than-life bodyguard, assassin, and assistant in one. The book is well-written and intelligent.  The beginning is just a little slow, but the pace picks up soon (once it does, it's hard to put it down). Recommended for fans of fantasy and political mysteries.

Lt. Lucas Young is preparing for his second deployment in Afghanistan when the True Alpha of the Marines, Sergeant Noah Hammond, is put under his command at last-minute.  There are signs of attraction but the men have lots of other things to concern them.  For one thing, Lucas hasn't had the advanced training in handling werewolves that he needs, primarily due to an incompetent superior officer.  So, he's finding out about how werewolves and their hierarchy work in the military as it goes.

This is good, because we get to see things along with him.  And he has to deal with how to be an officer in charge of a powerful were who in their society, outranks pretty much everyone.

My quibbles arise after the setup when Lucas continues to remain at times knowing (by instinct, it seems), but also amazingly ignorant of what's up with the weres and the Alpha.  I bought the ignorance at first, but then there are fellow officers who tell him that he can consult with them, and then it seems as if almost everyone else seems to know more than Lucas (they are helping him out, but somehow he remains clueless until things happen).  So maybe they are all better trained--but Lucas now has the training manuals he was previously denied, PLUS he has a relationship with the Alpha and people keep telling him to have a talk with the guy, but that never happens--even when they have some downtime amidst all the action of the deployment.  Then there's a bit of the old ""I like him but I don't think he likes me that way"" going on between BOTH of them thrown in.  I understand that these guys are manly men and don't like talking, but really???  *Sigh*

Family Blood Ties Series Book One
Tessa is an oddity, what they called a throwback. She just felt like a sixteen-year-old suspended between two worlds and not fitting in either one. A girl in a family of vampires who had human genes. When the guy she likes is kidnapped by her own kind, Tessa finds what she is really made of.

Cody is from one of the oldest pureblood families and Tessa's family is like his own, she's always been like a little sister. The night she goes to rescue her human friend he sees a whole new side to her. Little Tessa has grown up.

It takes a young girl to get the old vampires going out of their comfort zone to help find out what is going on in their world. Beyond humans being kidnapped it looks like evil mischief is happening as well. A well written and page turning story. Warning...it does end with quite the cliffhanger but the good news is that book two; Vampire in Distress, is already out there for you to continue the journey. Sian's Solution is a short story that introduces the series.

While this was quite a long book (20 hours and 39 minutes of listening time), I found it very enjoyable with a great plot that I thought at times I had figured out but was incorrect.

5183,"""Oh Susannah : It's In the Bag"" by Carole P. Roman documents some of Susannah's experiences at the local school. From doing homework to doing poorly on a surprise quiz, Susannah is consumed with the daily drudgery of school, as well as, the parental oversight.

This new book in a series puts a realistic face on typical school day experiences of young children. Life is not always ""peaches and cream"" as teachers hold their students accountable for their academic performance on various occasions.

I'm impressed with the realistic nature of a typical day in the life of a youngster. Carole definitely captures the realism in the daily experiences of primary grade students.",4,"[-2.063110871198237, -1.4012918627849276, -1.3275905426608101, -1.041716709592555, -0.951400978610955]",-0.951400978610955
5061,"Snowed In With The Boss by Lili Valente

Well, this was certainly a sizzling hot little novella! It's the story of Jane and the delicious Mr Tennyson, or simply, Ten. As the title may suggest, Ten is Jane's boss. He's also a Dom with a penchant for spanking and a heart for Jane. Jane has always known she's a sub and has finally decided to actively seek out a Dom who'll train her. Considering she works for a cyber security firm, it's not that hard for her emails to be intercepted and for Ten to take action.

This is definitely not my usual type of read but I've really enjoyed the last few books I've read by this author (RomComs) so I thought I'd just give it a go and was pleasantly surprised. It is a novella so it's a quick read, with plenty of heat. I also enjoyed the romantic aspect of Ten being in love with Jane for some time and just keeping quiet about. Again, not my usual preferred genre but it was a great way to fill an afternoon.

1482,"Rick Hoffman started out as a sharp guy with a great investigative reporter job, a great fianc and plenty of money linked to his job.  It bought him access to search out crime and scandal wherever it existed.  But now his fortune is in reverse mode with no job, no fianc and no money, just a dilapidated home sorely in need of a makeover in order to be sold.  His Dad was a lawyer who is now a resident in a nursing home as a result of a massive stroke that pretty much ended not only his job but any way to communicate with Rick, or anyone else for that matter.
So Rick is out of money and the owner of several maxed out credit cards. Hardly a paragon of success!  However, while talking about renovations with his neighbor, they are wrecking an upstairs wall and come upon a stack of packages.  Rick has discovered way over a million dollars of cash.  He thinks his neighbor has seen him trying to hide it but isn't sure.  So the story really begins with several problems.  Where is he to hide all this money?  Where did all this money come from?
All of Ricks sleuth skills are now in play.  Talking to people who knew his fathers work life and connections, he quickly discovers his Dad was what is known as a bag man. For those not into the criminal world, thats a person who pays off certain public and privately important people to get the job done, usually an illegal or secret job that must never be exposed to public scrutiny.
The tension mounts as its clear the owner or owners of that money know Ricks got the money and are going to do anything to get it back. That includes some very violent scenes that up the tension-riddled moments and Rick barely escapes up to a point.
The Fixer is connected to a scandal once known as Bostons Big Dig project.  Payoffs aren't news to most alert consumers and citizens in contemporary times.  What is never business as usual concerns the extent to which some important or powerful people will go to make sure that payoff plans become finished business.  Its up to Rick to finish the job!  Fairly simple plot but plenty of action  plus a little bit of sexy romance for those that love criminal fiction!",4,"[-3.730901190940738, -1.0037108510935615, -0.9528625803699765, -1.041999784180364, -1.0458649942913207]",-0.9528625803699765

2732,"Mark has dedicated his life to his work. First as a soldier, a spy, and now it his goal to become the Home Secretary. Its all within his grasp until hes informed he won't be considered without proving hes a family man and must present a wife. Thats going to be tricky because Mark already has a wife and theyve been separated for ten years.

Nicole is wild and free. She is not one to settle into what society dictates. For years she has lived her life in France where she is able to live the life she enjoys. However, she waits each day for the letter that will inform her that her husband has been killed while in service to his country. When he suddenly appears at her doorstep, her emotions are all over the place.

I loved this second chance story of a couple that have obstacles to overcome. There was just a tiny bit of misunderstanding that started the rift between them, but at the heart of it is a true separation of trust, beliefs, and wants. Perhaps a long honest conversation might have helped at the time but the fact that Mark was set in his belief of her position could not be ignored. Now, years later with more maturity and the opportunity to truly see one another, they may be able to heal what is broken between them.

Mark had every reason to feel the way he did but I personally thought he was a bit boneheaded. Nicole could have fought harder for him and what they had but she fled instead. Nevertheless, when you take those two decisions away, this story is quite charming with a bit of angst. I enjoyed reading how they reunited, placed conditions on each other, and came together for a common cause.

This is a really enjoyable book and Id love to read about some of the secondary characters as well.

Loved Ben and Olivia, two broken people trying to get over their pasts, especially Ben. Your heart breaks for our military men and women for what they have to endure protecting out country, Ben's demons and what he tries to get past is nothing short of heart wrenching. His disability once he comes back certainly could have been worse, but the emotional damage is what takes time to deal with. Olivia has had her own issues with being given up for adoption at a young age. When she and Ben come together it nothing short of magical, loved the chemistry between these two, the author does a great job with the details in this story. Didn't care for the way Ben dealt with things when he returned, but I guess no one really knows how to get back into society when returning from war after an hororable discharge.

4159,"I am a fan of author Elaine Vietss Dead-End Job and Mystery Shopper series, so I was eager to read the first book of her new series. This book features Angela Richman as a death investigator in a wealthy suburb of St. Louis. Angela must work with an often arrogant, as well as inept, police force while gathering and analyzing evidence at various crime scenes.

The book starts with Angela in the hospital and then goes back 3  months to describe the incidents leading up to Angelas brush with death.  Brain Storm tells a more complex, richer story than those in the authors lighter cozy series, but even with the serious subject matter is still injected with Vietss trademark humor.  I was surprised to learn some of the events in the book are based on the authors real experiences as a survivor of multiple strokes.

Angela is an interesting character and a great investigator as she fights to get healthy and solve a murder when everyone casts doubt on her observations. Angela is often an unreliable narrator because of her health condition and medications, which keeps the reader guessing about what is real and what isn't and I liked the suspense that added to the story. The instigation held my interest and I was pleased by the books conclusion. I would enjoy reading future books featuring Angela and her friend Katie who is the assistant medical examiner.

In pure Jill Shalvis fashion, Accidentally On Purpose, Archer and Elle's story, unfolds with panache. The combination of Elle's sassy and self sufficient nature with Archers all alpha male bad-a$$ery is just so wonderful.

Elle's one of those heroine's that is very easy to rally behind. She's overcome a troubled past, works really hard going to school and as an employee, and is a loyal friend. The decade old history with Archer reflects a time in her life that she keeps under-wraps. She's built a wall between her past and her present and she keeps her guard up for good reason. Archer, privy to her past, a part of her past, just can't seem to stop himself from interfering in her life. There's a camping trip where he teases her mercilessly, a date that he interrupts and a few bad guys to protect her from. Their story is action filled in and out of the bedroom (or office, or woods). He's so conflicted about her and how she fits into his sphere, into this group of shared friends, and this makes him a bit unpredictable when it comes to Elle.

The near constant battle for control made for a very entertaining read. I waxed between a cheesy grin and gasps of astonishment as the mystery came to light and we realize just how much they affect each other. It's not exactly a second chance love story, but it's the chance for these 2 to get it right and stop fighting their connection.

Pike is the leader of a group of undercover soldiers, part of a secret US government sanctioned organization known only as the Task force devoted to taking down America's enemies wherever they may be.  His cover for his work with his group is a business he has in partnership with his girlfriend, lover and member of his elite team - Jennifer Cahill.  Jennifer has a university degree in Archaeological studies and the business' purpose is to go around where needed seeking artifacts of scientific and historical value.
  The Insider Threat is Col. Taylor's first novel concerning the horrific threat of Isis and it's complete disregard for any feelings of humanity towards the people it conquers.  Rumors of an attack in Europe bring Pike and his group to Italy to seek out the Isis group termed the ""Lost Boys"" and prevent them from carrying out their assignment.  Coincidentally they again meet  characters from a previous novel who had been working for the Mossad; Shosanha  and her partner Aaron Bergman.  The two had left the Mossad and were handling independent contracts for other Israeli interests.  They were tasked with killing one of the Isis conspirators involved with the group Pike and his group were after.  The two join with the Task force group agreeing to cooperate as necessary to accomplish both missions.
  The book, as all other Pike Logan novels, is filled with action, military strategy and an attention to logical plot and follow through.  Shosanha and Aaron fit in with the Task Force operation and surely will take part in further actions.  An emphasis is placed on Jennifer's growth in knowledge of what the group does and her contribution with ideas and methods towards the ultimate success of the mission at hand.  Although she indicates at the end of the book that she is tired of the killing and fighting involved with the group's missions it is very likely that she will continue to work with Pike in future adventures.
  A novel moving with lightning speed and action guaranteed to maintain the reader's attention and set the pace for the next Pike Logan adventure.",4,"[-1.5383700811126124, -1.1059757851606273, -0.9568073925834343, -0.9777359833763098, -1.4071388713322812]",-0.9568073925834343

Layla O'Reilly was jilted by her ex-fianc, Jack, to marry her snotty cousin Jessica instead. Family being family she is expected to show up at the wedding and has no intention of doing so without a date. Problem is the friend she counted on to help her prove she was over her ex cancels on her at the last minute.

Seth Murphy, who was once the best friend of Layla O'Reilly's ex-fianc would be the last person she'd go to for help, but coincidence puts him in the right place at the right time and Layla is desperate.  The thing is Seth is a little desperate himself, because Layla has never forgiven him for the part he played in with Jack and Jessica hooking up.  And Seth has never forgiven himself for letting Jack ask her out first and losing her to him years ago because he has secretly loved Layla for years, even when she was dating his best friend. So he sees this as possibly his last shot at the woman he loves.

At the wedding the bride can't resist rubbing her new groom in Layla's face and Seth can't help but defend Layla with the first thing that comes to mind.  He tells them they are engaged and gives a date less that four weeks away. At first Layla is upset, but there are reasons to carry on the charade for at least a week or so and she gives in. Seth is determined to make the most of this time he's been given to win Layla over and make her his permanently. Layla is prickly at first, but she can't help but warm up to Seth's sincerity and obvious true affection for her. Not that she made is pursuit of her easy, he really had to prove himself to her, which made the story just that much more heartwarming to read. The romance in The December Bride is sweet as is Seth and the story was the perfect treat just before bed.

Beau is planning on getting married to an outsider; Lee is faced with dealing with his deep feelings for his female BFF Masyn. This story will grab your heartstrings from the moment the story starts. I don't want to give the plot away for I want everyone to read and find out who ends up with whom for this is an awesome story so what I will say is that I love the dynamic and growth of the characters and the realization that theres more to relationships and figuring out how to get there and make them work. I liked the most was that the story was from Lee's point of view. It tells us how he views things and gives us his insight. Masyn is a spunky, sassy, sensitive woman who really grabs the readers attention from the first page and has you rooting for her  wanting her to find her HEA. I really liked Lee and saw how he truly loved Masyn from the start. As for Beau, I can see how many might not like him but I understood how he can to be the way he was and how he grew up during this story. I loved the secondary characters in this book (Beau and Peyton) and hope there will be a 2nd book with those characters. I loved the heart and emotions this book put out and felt the author did a great job. This was a great read and I look forward to reading more from her in the future.

I tried a few 1"" (3 cm) dry wood branches and cut through them almost instantly. I worked my way up to a 4"" (12 cm) diameter old dry tree branch which I figure is as large as one would wish to saw in a survival or camping context. I got through the larger branch in less than a minute expending very little effort. Duplicating this with the machete saw would take much longer and require many times the effort.

In use this saw is safe - much safer than the dangerous machete saw. However, it takes a deft touch to unfold or re-fold it from or to its storage pouch. The very sharp teeth will bite you if you aren't careful. I used rugged work gloves for these tasks and recommend you do the same.

At first , everything was great, he had a different woman every night and crowds of adoring women every night but soon he was tired of the parade of women and the stripping. Then he meets Allyand he starts thinking of ways to make her his..for good.
Ally Dylan is a good girl, an innocent. She is at her soon to be married friend Brenda's home and everyone is going crazy over the strippers but not Ally. She feels like they are making a scene for nothing, until she meets Matthias and then she lets him teach her how to go a bit crazy.  Between his dirty talk and his dancing, soon they are doing the horizontal mambo. Ally sneaks out afterwards, thinking she'll never see Matthias again but Matthias is determined to see lil Miss Ally again and he went to great lengths to get her information so he could find her again. Ally left thinking she would never see him again or so she thought but what she didn't know is how much of a great impression she left on the Prince of Caspierre.
I loved the magic between Ally and Matthias. There is some angst between the two and the ups and downs of their relationship.  I really enjoyed how this story was told in dual POV and the passion and heat is fantastic between Ally and Matthiasthe twists and turns kept me on my toes and the ending was sweet. I hope we get to see some of the characters in this story in future books.

5069,"""Keep the beauty alive in the ugly.""

Drifter is book one in the Nomad series by Author Janine Infante Bosco.  It is an MC novel and the first book in the Nomad Series.

""He's the guy who enticed the bad girl buried beneath the class, the guy that makes that girl want to come out and play.""

Stryker has seen and experienced more in his young life than one hundred men combined.  Gina is a spitfire.  Her surety and spunk aren't present without reason. She is a strong contender in business and can hold her own in and out of the office.

""We're looking for lightning. We're going to get burned. That's a fact.""

I was in shock and disbelief in the opening pages of Drifter. I know these things happen, I am a bit naive to it. But, reading it is always a jolt to my system.  I knew immediately that Stryker was going to have baggage that he could never comfortably carry. But was caught off guard by the extra burden those around him would be forced to shoulder. I love how Stryker was a sexy, alpha-male, but also had a gentle side that he showed to those he loved.  When Gina was added to the picture, their compatibility and heat was unstoppable, they were such a great couple. The only drawback to this story was the inconsistent editing errors that occasionally caught my eye. However, the storyline kept me invested and the characters felt like long-lost family.

Drifter was a fast-paced, edge of your seat, wipe the sweat from your brows and lust from you eyes read.

While I was aware lynchings did occur, I didn't realize how widespread they were and that people were killed for the most trivial of offenses. ""Trial"" was very moving and informative and because of the subject matter, sometimes hard to read. However, the violence had to be a part of the book to show the horrors people in the town were facing.

The book was suspenseful and the short chapters keep the story moving. I was shocked right along with Ben when he learned who could be trusted and who couldn't in his old hometown. There was a strange scene at the end of the book when he and Abraham's granddaughter Moody are provoking a reaction out of the town's people that didn't seem to fit and that took away from the book somewhat.

Lily Harkness has a past that haunts her.  She proves she can still be tough by working in a men's profession as CEO of Harkness Oil and Petroleum.  She arrives in Dahar seeking exclusive rights of the country's oil reserves.  What she doesn't expect is to have to deal with one very stubborn Sheikh.

It's thinner than a normal cutting board, but still produces excellent results. These types of boards don't dull knives and can be sterilized, which is great when dealing with potential pathogens (meats, etc).

It has four non-slip corners which helps keep it in place. Surprisingly, this is the best feature. I can't tell you how many times a board has slipped on me and I've nearly sliced off my finger. These non-slip pads are an excellent idea.

Luca is a pyromaniac and I don't feel it was fully explained how or why that came to be.  I found their relationship to be very intense and although he was always brooding, you could tell that he wanted to help her.  When he finally finds out what happened to her and why shes there, the desire to right the wrong done to her causes him to make a deal that will turn on him.
Allison is very reserved and doesnt trust easily.  After she gives her heart to Luca, a betrayal causes her insecurities and self-doubt to root deeply in her soul.
Part Two brings us to years later when they meet again and the hurt comes back to the surface.  I wanted Luca and Allison to find themselves face to face again.  I was rooting for them to get together, and although they finally do, I wasn't satisfied with the way it happened.  We are made to understand that Luca explains the reason for his departure from the institution all those years ago, but it is never explained to the reader.  I wanted to know what happened and was disappointed that it wasn't shown.
There are misunderstanding adding to drama and characters that want to see them separated.  The secondary characters, like Ollie and Archer added so much interest to the story and I found myself wanting to know much more about them.

775,"Dante (Danny) Valentine makes a pretty good living as a necromancer. Raise the dead, ask a few questions, and terms of the will or suspicions of murder can all be answered. When a demon shows up at her door, points a gun in her face, and summons her to a meeting with Lucifer himself, though, that's way beyond the job description--even though Danny does the occasional bounty hunting job.

What Lucifer wants is for him to track down a rogue demon--a demon who, according to Lucifer, stole a mysterious 'egg' from Hell. If that egg hatches, Lucifer assures Danny that the Earth just might not survive the experience. To help her, Lucifer sends his personal hatchet-demon, Japhrimel to ensure she survives long enough to confront the rogue. Because, unfortunately, he's given his personal word that neither demon nor man shall harm the rogue.

Danny wants to go alone, but her friends insist on coming along. When their journey takes her to the city where her ex-boyfriend lives, he joins in as well. She needs all the help she can get. The rogue has taken over a Mafia family and has plenty of human resources, as well as his own demonic powers, to call on. Danny doesn't seem to stand a chance, especially given Lucifer's promise. Being a woman just doesn't seem enough.

Author Lilith Saintcrow creates an interesting take on the legend of demons. Far from being unmitigated evil, demons like people--and have manipulated their DNA to raise them from apes to something that a demon could socialize with. Of course not all of the ancient legends are false, either--and the hideous power demons hold is dangerous indeed. Dante Valentine is a damaged but sympathetic character, attempting to survive, dealing with her losses (begining with being abandoned as an infant), and torn between a demon lover and the man who once held her heart and then broke it.

1529,"I have read many of Deepak Chopra's books through the years with great enjoyment. I particularly read his books during the time that he was a spokesman for Transcendental Meditation. He is a great story teller and having heard him speak a couple of times, also a great inspirational speaker. Brotherhood by Deepak and his younger brother Sanjiv added another dimension to the Chopra story for me. This book was set up with each brother writing a chapter without the help or consultation of the other. The brothers write alternating chapters. At times they tell about the same people or experiences, but from a different perspective. At other times the chapters aren't related in subject at all.
Deepak has been publicly involved in more spiritual matters in his previous writing. Sanjiv appears to have a more scientific attitude. Both are medical doctors, though I do not believe Deepak is involved in medicine to a great degree, except perhaps Ayurveda. Sanjiv practiced a more traditional western medicine and is a professor and a dean at Harvard Medical school.
Being somewhat familiar with their backgrounds in India, I found Brotherhood a great addition to my knowledge of India, their families and what it was like to grow up in India. The stories in Brotherhood are extremely well written and very entertaining. They are humorous, moving, and at the same time historical. I found Sanjiv's writing to be particularly good, especially since it is Deepak who has been the one writing books for many years. In Brotherhood Deepak's writing gives the impression of being overwhelmed by the information that he is relaying and becomes somewhat scattered. On the other hand Sanjiv's writing is clear and more linear.
Perhaps, I have been a bit too analytical in this review. Overall the book is very enjoyable, and is a quick and easy read. When Sanjiv was asked how he might live his life differently if he had the chance, he described exactly what he had done and said he would do it again. These are two extremely intelligent and caring individuals who have added greatly to this country and to the world.

On the Street Where You Live uses many of the plot techniques familiar to MHC's devoted readership.

In this book, Emily Graham takes time out from practicing law to get settled in to an ancestral home in a seaside resort town. The description reminded me of Cape May with fewer tourists. One of Emily's ancestors disappeared from the home a century ago. Around the same time, several other young women vanished so a serial killer was suspected. Now in modern times, another woman was missing and turns up buried in Emily's backyard.

As the press begins to talk of a reincarnation of the serial killer, the reader is presented with a variety of prime suspects. MHC scatters the clues widely and provides seven or eight likely candidates with opportunity and possible motives for the recent murder.

Nineteen months ago, Ben, a Navy SEAL, was overseeing a mission with his best friend, Trent, and the rest of his team. Details were methodically planned, always leaving room for possible variables, but Ben could've never planned for what happened. Now he's the Director of Security at Albany Medical Center and his best friend is gone. As he's currently avoiding being his only company, he's enjoying a drink at the local bar when he intervenes, adding his help as the woman he had been admiring tries to shake an aggressively bold man.

Presley, a nurse, recognizes the sexy Ben right away, purposefully making movements to showcase her ""assets"" for his benefit. Unfortunately, he doesn't recognize her, though as she reminded her friend and fellow nurse, Lucy, a lot of people are employed by the hospital. Though Presley did get, and immensely enjoy, the good night kiss Ben gave her after politely offering to take her home.

Two weeks later, Ben is delighted to run into Presley on the Pediatric floor during his last walk through of the day. He may not have recognized her that night, but he hasn't stopped thinking about her, plus he may have driven by her house a few times in the hopes of being able to visit.

As time goes by, Ben and Presley get to know each other during dates and stolen moments together here and there as their schedules allow. While both are falling fast, they can also see that the other is holding something back, not giving of themselves fully to each other.

Will Ben and Presley be able to share their past hurts with each other, emotionally changing ones that have made them who they are today? Can Ben share the secret he's been carrying about what happened to Trent? Can Presley trust that Ben won't be yet another person to leave her? Will they get their HEA?

One-click now to follow these two people as they find some peace with their pasts and look forward to a future filled with love and happiness. While this book tends to go at a slower pace and doesn't feature any of the usual type of conflicts one expects from a romance story, it does feature deep emotional struggles for both main characters and their fight to overcome them and embrace the love they're meant to have.

What I liked about this book:
Ben and Renee--they were perfect for each other. Renee is funny and has the ability to laugh at herself when things get crazy. She has an interesting job that sounds fun. Ben has a great sense of humor, and I love a hero with a sense of humor.
Secondary characters Chuck, Janice and Eve--they are all nice and sincerely cared about Renee.

What I didn't like:
Ben was awfully quick to believe what Tracy said about Renee, so his hero crown got a little tarnished for me.
Janice is a great friend to Renee, but when Renee was wallowing after the outcome of the show (we all need to wallow after a big setback, especially in the romance department, Janice tells her she needs to take a shower. If one of my friends ever said that to me when I was down, I'd be really mad.
When Renee was relesed from the hospital, the author made it seem liked she walked out on her own--I've been in the hospital numerous times and they have to take you out in a wheelchair when you're released.
The show was almost exactly like ""The Bachelor."" I thought the author could have made it a little more original.

On the whole, though, I enjoyed this book.",3,"[-3.9003914261906445, -1.0454570102673009, -1.0404705778834276, -0.968034262804671, -0.9685923560201362]",-0.968034262804671

Review:

I totally enjoyed this story by ""new to me"" Author Stacey O'Neale.

I was very curious by the blurb to this story and picked it up for review.  I like the Earth Girls Are Never Easy part, it reminded me of the older movie.  That is the only thing similar between the two.  This is a more serious, action packed story where the movie was goofy.  To get back on track, this book held my attention from the very beginning.  Now, there are some funny moments, for example when Kaden and Bells go on their first formal date and Kaden researches formal dates online and ends up giving them a prom date.  I liked that the Author made them not totally acclimated to our culture and there is the funny mix up, like their first date, I think it makes it seem more realistic. This story is not super sexy hot, it does have some sexy scenes, but I would rate it a moderate on the hot scale.  I do think when Cam and Hilary get their own story it will be great, I really enjoyed these two characters and their one scene together left me wanting more of them. It did have some predictable moments, such as who the bad guy was, but it did not detract from my liking the story.  The story was interesting and different enough from others of the same genre to keep me reading and I was done very quickly with it.

Can't wait to read the next book!

Alas, reality and fiction only sometimes resemble each other and I will just have to get used to being disappointed.

I won't be giving a blurb about the plot or actions in this book. Just remember that real heroes, sadly enough, are all too often characters in a novel and especially heroes with psychic abilities beyond our understanding. More the pity, that.

Kristin Newman is a comedy writer, who instead of settling down, chose instead to travel.  Not just travel, but travel to the fullest.  Seeing and doing everything possible, and that includes lots of relationships with men.  A sort of vactionship - some of them she wished would last longer and some she just enjoyed for the moment.  At some parts, I cringed, worried  at her recklessness with strange men.

She had a saying and Im probably misquoting here, but it was something like, You must do the thing that you must do in the place that you must do it.  I love that.  I referenced that line several times in our recent trip to California.  Her openness to try everything is inspiring and I really did take away a sense of how I might like to change my life - be more open, experience more (minus the sleeping with all the men!).

Loved Sienas linequit with the pissing contests, and do your goddamn job which, last time I checked, was racing not constantly whipping it out to see whose is bigger.  Ah but then thats part of the fun of the story too.

Its refreshing that Siena and Harrison act like adults and handle their relationship issues with maturity. Like another reviewer posted, there isn't bickering or misunderstandings to create drama.  When faced with turmoil that might cause a less mature character to give up, these two look for solutions to their problems using their skills, talent, and a level head. They have faith in each other and believe in each other despite the obstacles their relationship faces.  The drama in the story comes from outside forces, which keeps you reading to find out what is going to happen next.  This is so refreshing to read when compared to some of the other contemporary romance stories out there.

Faster Deeper is fueled with excitement and a touch a mystery as the blackmailer suspects pile up while being narrowed down. More hot and daring love scenes are a big plus.

Written from the unique perspective of an impartial narrator of Harriet's life, this book reminds me of retrospective documentary.

It was interesting to see how the situation with Hardy was going to play out as he was accused of murder.  I liked how the new minister was introduced and what he brought to the story.  It was very cool to see Hardy's transformation and the minister's influence.  Learning more about what led to World War II was fascinating.  It was also exciting to see Winston Churchill enter the story!  I always love the rich history Michael Phillips brings to his books.  I liked the back and forth of Brogan and Emily's story in 1924 and David and Loni's story in 2006.  It was interesting to learn more about Emily's Quaker faith, and to see that it was as strong as David and Loni's.  I especially liked seeing how David treated everyone so well, even Hardy who treated him terribly, and what a witness he was because of that.  There's a little bit of romance as David and Loni are committed to each other and there's several other people forming couples in their sphere.  There were also several wonderful secondary characters.

453,"The author defines power, its manifestations and strategies.
The use of power can have constructive manifestations and ends. The author attempts to represent power used in a positive modality. He cautions us to disarm adversaries with honesty and generosity. Manipulations can be dangerous. In some cases, they can backfire.

The author suggests that we can pose as a friend to gain trust
and information. This can have positive consequences; however,
it can backfire as a strategy. The idea that absence can increase
respect is interesting. If we are having an important beneficial
impact on an organization,  our absence will surface holes in
the throughput of productivity. As a consequence, management
will perceive value in the absence of a valuable employee
until his/her return. The author suggests that we should
concentrate force for maximum value. This can be beneficial;
however, the tactic can backfire if the group perceives that
it is being manipulated for personal gain. The maxim ""to learn
when to stop"" is important. There are times when less is better.

There are other personal qualities enunciated in this work.
These qualities are as follows:
- nonchalance or unobviousness in execution/implementation
- flattery will get you everywhere
- do not be the bearer of bad news
- be frugal in asking favors of superiors
- master your emotions
- become a source of pleasure rather than a burden

This book contains some good advice, if applied in the correct
context(s). It is well worth the price paid if the precepts are
applied dispassionately.",3,"[-3.072973247180702, -2.263309180457144, -1.5572674412537348, -0.9712651032968435, -1.0051427716775416]",-0.9712651032968435

THE MURDERERS DAUGHTER by Jonathan Kellerman, a standalone featuring protagonist Dr. Grace Blades, a dedicated and intelligent psychologist with a horrific past; two worlds collide  an intriguing psycho-crime suspense, with a strong mix of literary fiction.

Grace, 34, a highly regarded psychotherapist in L.A. Her therapy room is located in a 1920s English cottage serving as her professional headquarters on a quiet corner in West Hollywood. Grace had insisted on the ideal location so patients could enter on one street and exit on the other. She has a gift for treating troubled souls and tormented psychesand her own childhood tragedy.

Flashing back and forth we learn of a five-year-old- Grace in a trailer park, who lived with two strangers on the fringes a desert. Her biological mother and father were alcoholic drug addicts. There was a violent murder  a bloody suicide, and she is placed in foster care and later adopted.

Grace, now a highly intelligent psychologist, has a dark secret life. She enjoys one night stands with strangers. Turns out, one man (one of the hookups), Andrew becomes a new patient, traveling out of state to see her. (using an alias, of course). When she realizes he is from her past, and turns up dead, she now is in danger.

Now her professional life and past collide  a past she thought was behind her. Will her double life be exposed? Now Grace conducts her own investigating, pulling her back into the evil violent past, she thought she had escaped.

Grace, an intriguing damaged character a survivor, brilliant, intelligent, yet cold and dark, at times and detached. She possesses tenacity and is driven to solve the mystery--She has to face her demons from the past in order to have a future.

Due to Graces complex character, felt THE MURDERERS DAUGHTER was more of a deep character study, than a thriller, with seamless transition from past to present- Nicely Done.

Shes been in town for 2 years now and Travis has had an eye on her since the beginning but has never made a move. He has rules and they are stifling, but one by one he breaks the rules because he cant deny himself anymore. Elaine has been trying hard to get ahead and her past is one she wants to forget and move forward but when the two get close while hes running for Sherrif her past may come to haunt both of them and hinder his chances.
What a read of not only some steamy scenes but they were sensual to top it off with the intimacy they shared but not only that I loved how they have known each other for two years so when they fall in love its not insta anything which makes it all that much more when they use the word love. Travis is a good man with a good heart not resorting to underhanded tactics and trying to win on his own merit but not only that he treats Dax like his own, a man you would want in your corner if needed. Elaine is amazing, with everything she went through but stuck it out because of her son when she could have easily went any other way instead of becoming a hard working, selfless, kind woman that she is.
An amazing great read and now I cant wait to read about the others and of course reading about Colton, the long lost brother of Travis who finally returns home.

Eva Lapp is thrust into a life of independence rather unexpectedly, and is somewhat skeptical which direction her life is headed, even at the age of 29. Unsure of herself and concerned about past rumors she attempts to move forward with her life, still hopeful for a home and family of her own.

Numerous characters fill the pages of this Amish fictional tale, some likable, some not so much! Character development is well done, and as in the past this author captures and portrays the settings exceptionally well. I was transported to the countryside of Amish farms, and enjoyed the setting of a locally owned nursery with gift shop and cafe.

Original and fast paced, Starting From Scratch is filled with lessons in living, particularly for one lonely Amish woman. Pick up a copy for a great reading experience, particularly if you love reading about the Amish way of life.

Now hes back in town to attend his brothers wedding to her cousin. But its not the whole story  a troublemaking photo had leaded him back into town. He needed to protect Dusty, and he needed to explain himself. Problem is, where would he start?

It took two years for Dusty to gain Coldens attention  she got what she wanted, and even broke a fence for evidence, but the next day, he was nowhere to be found. Years later, he was back in town but he was no longer the same person as he was. He was no longer the good-cop. Instead, he was sure of himself, more aggressive and certainly hotter. Dusty needed to be careful, or else she was in for heartbreak.

It was tantalizing, hot, steamy, sweet and I so love the chase of the thrill. Both characters are interesting and stubborn to a fault. I wished Colden would just be straight honest to Dusty why he needed to leave. Im sure shed understand. Dusty just wanted to protect her heart, she had issues with people leaving her, and Colden leaving her did not only struck her ego, but her heart as well. It will take a lot of crawling on his part to get on her good terms once again.

These two had a lot of pent-up frustration, the sexual tension was extreme, and every exchange was pure foreplay. I enjoyed reading this novel. This was a book that kept me warm during the storm  thank you Kelly Gendron. :)

Marie has been a victim of online dating in more than one occasion. She finally decides to give up online dating and ends up sharing with her friends the bad experiences that she has had during their knitting times which are always fabulous. When the guy from her last bad date happens to come by. He happens to be Greg and Fiona's neighbor, Matt.
Matt is into robots, he believes he can build machines that can replace human affections and when he sees Marie, he needs her help in order for his latest project to work.  Marie doesnt have an issue with that because she would love to pick his brain for her latest article, which is about dating. They end up agreeing to help each other and the sparks really start to fly. They are each unique in their own way and with them both looking at dating for what is needed ,we get a birds eye view of  todays  modern dating and the solutions to today's solutions to human loneliness. I could relate to this story and what the author was striving to express and its unique storyline which really was awesome to see about how they met and then met again. There was some parts to the story that had me uneasy/angry but other parts that had me smiling and totally engrossed. I cannot lie, this story will have you riding a roller coaster of emotions- thats all I can say without giving away spoilers.

Her daily struggle, the abstract nightmare of it all, while still retaining an indomitable spirit of hope and will to survive against extreme hardships and almost daily set-backs.  The sparseness of the novel (while decried by some with one star reviews), for me, helped make the stark reality more 'real'.  What beauty what meaning can you find when you are worried about the daily struggles for money, food, and even trying to help watch out for others?
As a child of a war survivor myself, the 'reality' faced with determination and hope is probably the greatest lesson that I have from my mother and grandparents who survived WW II.  The characters in this novel, daily struggling to overcome the harsh realities of their lives and trying to make something better for themselves in the future while managing to bring some hope and care into the lives of a few others in their sphere of influence showed the interdependence and strength of community, friends, and family that can happen even in the direst circumstances.",3,"[-4.549854972912324, -2.0774462894470522, -1.2842779867960719, -0.9738647897241912, -1.349743771644459]",-0.9738647897241912
2189,"Take an aging, vulnerable woman who lives alone in an isolated environment.  Add in a less than savory caregiver who gives copious hints that she is not everything she says she is.  It's a formula that has been used by Tatjana Soli in The Forgetting Tree and the Finnish author Tove Jansson in The Unwanted Guest... among others.  Fiona McFarlane revisits it in The Night Guest and places her own spin on it.  And the great thing is - it works, exceedingly well.

The two key characters are Ruth Field, a woman who lives alone in an Australian seaside home after the death of her husband, often commanding up memories of her Fijian childhood, her two sons who live far away, and her first love, a man named Richard.  Into this lonely world comes Frida Young, who claims to be sent by the government as a caregiver.

Yet right from the start, the reader senses that something is off.  Frida doesn't exactly act like a typical caregiver.  Ruth seems...well, some of her actions are called into question.  And the dynamics between the two women smack of a certain sadomasochism.  And then there's the question of the tiger, that Ruth swears enters her parlor at night, and which Frida appears to buy into.  What is true and what is false?  What can the reader believe?

In Fiona McFarlane's capable hands, all this is quite believable.  The writing is assured, confident, hypnotic and suspenseful...and often luscious with detail.  The psychological underpinnings are subtlely rendered and the denouement is authentic and organic.  And the themes are universal: aging and the loss of independence, trust tempered with fear, memory and reality.

Ruth - an ordinary yet extraordinary older woman - comes across as fully-realized;  she is overly considerate, her back hurts, she doesn't want to give up her car, she still has that spark of life, she is able to laugh at herself.  Frida is appropriately menacing and yet...in a strange way, seems to genuinely care about Ruth.  This is a fine debut and portends good things for this young author.

1573,"Eve Duncan is a renowned forensic sculptor who can recreate a realistic likeness from a human skull. Her daughter, Bonnie, was murdered by a serial killer 10 years earlier and the body was never recovered. Her good friend from the Atlanta PD, Joe Quinn, is involved in a case where many bodies are unearthed near the Talladega Falls. One of the bodies is from a young girl who might have been Eve's daughter. Joe asks Eve if she would like to reconstruct the head from the skull and she jumps at the chance, because she still wants to bring Bonnie home and put her to rest.
The killer, who calls himself Dom, has become jaded and complacent and no longer feels any lasting thrill or excitement from his kills. He contacts Eve and reveals to her that he has another victim planned and gives her enough clues to track down Jane, a 10-year old girl in a foster home in Atlanta.
Thus begins a cat and mouse game that increases in intensity throughout the book. Eve knows that she is the bait for Dom, and tries desperately to locate Jane before he kills her. Once she has found Jane, Dom lures them to Phoenix where he claims his most recent victim is buried. They team up with a cadaver searching dog and his owner to try to locate the body in hopes that Dom has left some clues that will bring them closer to finding him and ending the spree of killing.

The book was about Benny and her playboy neighbour Henry. The story sees the two of them developing a friendship between themselves and turning into something more strongly. I really enjoyed Henry, who at the start of the book seemed like a self-absorbed playboy. However, further reading throughout the novel showed how much of a sweet and caring guy he is. Benny was such a fun character that was outspoken and at sometimes awkward towards guys that she was attracted to.

There were many moments in the book that made me laugh out loud. This was an enjoyable read, which I recommend for anyone that enjoys reading a sweet romance story.

I would not suggest these toys for kids much younger than this due to the darts being plastic and they come out fast and hard when they hit.
It does come with a small target that you can use with it. We actually went out to the store to get the BIG target for them to play with though the do prefer to just play games that do not include using the targets. If you do use the targets these darts will stick to them so is easy to keep score.
That being said my boys LOVE these things once they got used to them and mom set up the rules. They have not had any issues loading and shooting these blasters. They now have more BOOMco toys on their wish list for Christmas because they like them better than the 20 some Nerf shooters.

2536,"The unconventional love story between Noah Tate and Olivia Cane continues in Hitched: Volume Two, the second installment in the Improper Love series from bestselling author Kendall Ryan. Things pick up soon after where the first book left off. Olivia disappeared right before the wedding that would have fulfilled one part of what was required both her and Noah to gain ownership of Tate & Cane, the business their fathers started. Noah can only speculate what led to Olivia running off, but when she finally confesses the truth behind her runaway bride fiasco, Noahs protectiveness takes over. Olivia cant help but appreciate Noahs support and help, and she begins to see him in a new light. Can these two adversaries finally find more common ground and forge an actual friendship? However, Noah wants to be more than friends, but will he be able to convince Olivia that nothing about his feelings for her are fake?

I was surprised by how quickly the issue Olivia was facing was resolved and how the story was focused more on the relationship between Olivia and Noah. I did find myself frustrated with Olivia because of how she would be gushing with appreciation over Noahs help with her initial situation one minute and then treat him like a horny leper the next. I felt for the guy, especially since it was clear that he was being sincere and that he was trying his best to show her that he was more than the playboy she pegged him out to be. Clearly my sympathies were for Noah while I was reading this second volume, though I do admit to wishing he would have brought up the whole second stipulation in the agreement their fathers came up with. But hey, after the cliffhanger ending here, I cant wait to see what lengths Noah will go to in order to rectify his blunder and finally claim his wife for real. So far, so good.

This book was a fun read with lots of drama, very steamy sex scenes and love.  I found myself laughing at the back and forth banner that the main characters Bridgette and Troy have with each other.  The supporting characters were all amazing too.

After reading the prologue I knew I was going to enjoy this book.  Bridgette just starting a career and life in a new town has a boyfriend, David, who is just a jerk.  He wants her to himself but is never with her or around when she needs him.  His other friends and poker tournaments are his number 1 priority.  She decides that she does not want to be his girlfriend anymore.  David did not take that well.

Entered Troy, every girls dream man.  He is loyal, sweet, funny, sexy and a fireman.  He has a way with his words too.  He requires completely honesty in his relationships.  Troy learned first hand that being lied too hurts.

As Bridgette and Troy meet, they have an unmistakable chemistry.  When their relationship takes a more than friendly approach the sparks fly.  But David is not done with Bridgette.  He has turned into that crazy ex boyfriend who will not leave her alone.

Events happen to cause both Bridgette and Troy to realize that they love each other.  But can they get over the past and lies that have happened?  Can they find happiness and forever in each other like the sun rises each day?

These characters have a chance meeting and them go about their relationship 5 years later not knowing who the other is and frankly doing it kind of backwards but it totally works. The story line had the bit of crazy and dark thrown in with lots of passion,  hot sex, and some healing of emotional wounds.
Nik and Aimee have kind of an unconventional meeting and start to everything but it totally works for their story. I loved how everything between them unfolded and they heal each other. As a reader its awesome to see a character heal and become whole throughout a story. Nik is a typical sexy alpha male who is determined to keep Aimee safe. He has a lot of guilt and emotional baggage that hes closed himself off from for so many years but Aimee helps him with all of that. She is a great person. Despite what shes had to do for money which lead her to her predicament, she is kind and caring but also feisty and not afraid to stand up for herself or someone she cares about. I really liked both of the main characters and they friends and family were wonderful as well.

2986,"I loved the cover for this book, so I thought I would give it a try. I am really happy to report that the cover did not lie. This is a passionately written novel. The opportunity to look through the eyes of the main character at the world of that time was like nothing I have experienced.

As a young woman with an unfortunate birth mark, the main character was dubbed ""Demon Woman"" by those in her homeland. She grew up under the protection of her father, and when a traveler, Noah, agreed to marry her and take her away from those who wished to lynch mob her, she did not have any idea of the life that awaited her.

An incredible journey, would be the best way I could think to describe this work. The amount of research Rebecca Kanner put into the writing of this book must have been endless. I love stories based on biblical figures, but this one truly topped the others I have read. The imagery is so vivid that you would swear you are there experiencing things yourself.

What made me feel so close to this book, was not just the humble attitude of the main character, but the developing relationship between her and the God her husband worshiped and relied on. As she fights to right wrongs amongst the people, raise her children and be a good wife, she proves that she is stronger than she could have imagined back when she was young.

From beginning to end, this was an enthralling read. The dialogue was so well written I had trouble imagining it was someone from this day and age that wrote it. There are some portions of the book that contain bad language, but I thought they were appropriate for the scenes they were in and added to the description of the people.

I Loved it. I would recommend this book to others who love tightly woven stories with a historical/biblical focus.

Alexandra Hemingway is a detective with a degree from Yale University. She comes from big money. When she was a child, her sister was murdered and this led her to choose the field she is in. She and her partner, Detective Phelps, have been together for seven years and work well together as a team. They are staggered when ten year-old boys start disappearing and turn up dismembered. They try to find a rhyme or reason for this and are led to a fertility clinic where they search for the link.

Adding to the concerns that Alex faces, is that she realizes she is pregnant herself. She is in a good, stable relationship but has doubts about bringing a child into such a dangerous world.

5212,"3.75 stars--FIGHT FOR HER is the first instalment in Vanessa Vales contemporary adult MMA FIGHTER ROMANCE series. This is former MMA fighter and gym owner Grayson Green, and practical nurse/single mom Emory.

NOTE: FIGHT FOR HER is a re-release and former titled 2016 novel Naked Choke.

Told from dual first person perspectives (Emory and Grayson) FIGHT FOR HER focuses on the building relationship between thirty eight year old practical nurse Emory, and former MMA fighter Grayson The Green Machine Green. Having met at a mutual friends engagement party Emory and Grayson were immediately attracted to one another but Grayson didn't want to push Emory too fast realizing that the woman with whom he would fall in love had no idea who he was, or what he did for a living. Emory was a single mother whose only child recently left for college but in the ensuing time our heroine struggled with her new independence. With little experience and even less knowledge about the who and what of Grayson Green, Emory and Grayson would take their time until a series of threats and a break in pushed Emory into Graysons arms. What ensues is the building relationship between Emory and Grayson, a threat focused on scaring our story line heroine,  and the embittered battle with someone from Graysons past.

The attraction between Gray and Emory is immediate but our heroine is a divorced mother of one and wary about what it is Grayson has to offer. Grayson struggles with his attraction to Emory and the possibility of bringing her into his world-a world embattled with demons from the past. The $ex scenes are intimate without the use of over the top sexually graphic language or text.

We are introduced to fellow MMA fighters Reed and Rob (aka Thor) as well as Emorys neighbour (and wingman) Simon, several friends including newly engaged Paul and Christy, and the owners of a local family run restaurant-the Casales.

I do have one issue and that is the fact that our heroine was never gifted a last name by the author. I struggle to accept in todays society that story book characters, especially women in a leading role, are relegated to first name only as though they were second class citizens and never entirely recognized.

Under Umbrellas unfortunately ends on a cliff hanger, but it was nevertheless a really good read.  I have found that Emma Nichols' writing style really pulls at my emotions and this book wasn't any different.  I was upset over Blaine's callous disregard of Martha when she had a miscarriage and his even more callous announcement of filing for a divorce.  I felt all the angst  Martha experienced travelling to a new destination, where the only things going for it were the name, and the warmer temperature. I identified with her uncertainty as she started putting her life together in New Hope.  The love-hate relationship Martha and Joe embarked on was amusing and I could see how Joe was able to motivate Martha to stand on her own two feet.  Incidents throughout the book were hilarious, in particular Martha determination to operate a chain saw.  Joe's significant gifts to Martha were charming and made me realise the importance of celebrating milestones.  The small town mentality of New Hope was typical of small towns the world over.  Everyone knows each other's business, but when the chips are down, people rally together and support one another.

1984,"With BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT Neal Griffin delivers a classic thriller churning with tension and an adversary with a need for revenge.  After serving seventeen years for a murder he insists he didn't commit, Harlan Lee is out of prison and traveling back to Wisconsin with a master plan of retaliation against the folks who framed him and sent him up the river.  No kidding, Harlan is a bad guy who commits grisly crimes however some of his transgressions pale in comparison to those of a few small town officials that put him in prison.  From the current chief of police to a thoroughly evil piece of work in the person of Narcotics Detective Doyle McKenzie it seems that the town of Newberg, Wisconsin has more than its share of villains in high places and Griffins writing demonstrates an excellent talent for exposing the dark, seedy side of corruption in a small town police department.

Caught in the middle of all this drama are Ben Sawyer, a former Oakland, CA. cop whose career has been on a downward spiral since an encounter with a fugitive that left him unemployed, and his wife Alex who have recently relocated to Newberg.  Both are targets in a carefully engineered set of circumstances that have result in life taking a dramatic and potentially life changing turn for the couple.

Griffins years spent in police work are obvious as he intuitively creates a company of seriously vile and depraved characters. There are so many unconscionable bad guys on both sides of the law throughout this novel that it becomes almost impossible to delineate between the good guys and the bad.

I certainly hope that this novel is the result of Griffins fertile imagination and bears no credible authenticity to individuals he has met in his years in law enforcement.",3,"[-5.724615946448407, -2.9421315523189606, -1.3183290855389351, -0.9782441633012273, -1.04502968716518]",-0.9782441633012273

1915,"Kensington Books and NetGalley provided me with an electronic copy of Where I Lost Her, in exchange for an honest review.

After years of infertility treatments and a failed adoption, a fractured marriage threatens to tear Jake and Tess apart.  During a visit with their close friends in rural Vermont, Tess spots a small child in the road.  Dirty and disheveled, the child runs off into the woods when Tess inadvertently spooks her.  The subsequent search by the authorities and civilian volunteers yields nothing, leaving many to question whether Tess was in her right mind.  With few supporters by her side, Tess puts herself into harm's way, to save the child and to be redeemed.

Where I Lost Her is a well paced psychological thriller with a great premise.  My favorite character in the book is Tess, as her struggles, her shattered confidence, and her absolute trust in what she knows to be right help form a complex and totally sympathetic character.  As her dreams were once destroyed, Tess hopes to be able to revived by finding this child.  Although Tess does not gain any support from her husband, she does find out that others believe in her.  The author uses broad strokes to bring to life a very important social issue: false adoptions.  The pain of not being able to bear your own children, then be promised a child under false pretenses, is clearly felt through the eyes of Tess.  Well written and fast paced, I highly recommend Where I Lost Her to those who like psychological thrillers.",3,"[-2.4500660263777583, -1.9193525865440297, -1.186803953033256, -0.989880515286305, -0.9783311694222413]",-0.9783311694222413

The latter takes our hero onto his team and they journey into Montana's Judith Basin on the heels of Custer's disastrous defeat. Despite warnings of the danger of remaining in the field, they make historical discoveries, including the first remains (teeth) of a Brontosaurus.
En route back to civilization, an attack by Sioux separates Johnson and the precious cargo from Cope who believes him killed.

After a series of hilarious adventures, including a gunfight with one of the Curry boys, an Earp-chaperoned passage through a gauntlet of outlaws, and another encounter with Marsh, Johnson makes it home to Philadelphia, a different man than when he left.

2091,"Dan Walsh has become one of my favorite authors, and I would put him at the top of my non-suspense author list, although he did write one suspense novel and it was a great read. I always look forward to a new book coming out from him, and I have been waiting for this one for several months, the fourth and final book in The Restoration Series.

  Book one centered on the parents in the Anderson family, and each book following has centered around one of their three children. This final one is about the youngest of the three, Doug, who is away in college.

  Although this book was not suspense, it was a fast read for me. Part of that was because I had been looking forward to reading it so much. The other reason I got into it so much is because I really enjoy prodigal stories, and this is one. I don't believe the authors call it a modern retelling of the prodigal son story from the Bible, but it very well could be. Son of a fairly affluent couple goes off to college and leaves his faith behind, falling into immorality and the wrong crowd. I knew Doug was going to hit bottom, and it was a bit painful to experience through the pages of the book, yet it was encouraging. The book had the message that even though we wonder from God, we can come back. He still loves us and will forgive.

  This is probably my favorite book of the series. They all resonated with me, as these are not light and fluff fiction, but books that carry a great message and has some great advice all through the pages for married couples and parents...... but I really needed the message of this book. That the same God who loves us and saves us is waiting to welcome us back and forgive us if we stray. I cannot say enough good bout this book and the whole series. Dan outdid himself on these four books, and Gary Smalley's expertise on family relationships is also seen in the plots of the books.

  These do go in order, and it is advisable to read them in the order that they were written: The Dance, The Promise, The Desire, and The Legacy.",4,"[-2.1238113665969873, -0.9788471283800219, -1.00420011085123, -1.0035821301011632, -1.140961241272696]",-0.9788471283800219

2816,"I've always been fascinated by the kind of men and women who decide to become cops. These are the folks who work hard to prevent crime, even to the point of performing daring acts of rescue and self-sacrifice.

But once an illegal act occurs, another side of the cop personality comes out. That's when police officers follow a careful procedure, a series of steps that helps them solve the crime. They fit the aberrations of human behavior into some kind of manageable form, which provides evidence for prosecutors to use.

Actor Jerry Orbach, who played Lenny Briscoe on Law & Order, first won me over to become a fan of police procedurals. More recently, I discovered the Precinct 11 Series by Jerry Jenkins, which features a great lead character named Boone Drake. Boone is a Chicago cop, who has had to overcome a life-altering tragedy. His story begins in The Brotherhood, where he learns that God can change the hardest of hearts--including his own.

The Betrayal, which picks up where the first book leaves off, shares a harrowing adventure. The woman Boone loves is being framed, and Boone's life is in danger. He struggles to investigate in spite of the injuries he received at the end of The Brotherhood. Though he's physically handicapped by his unhealed wounds, his inner man is stronger this time around. His new-found faith helps him win the day against all his enemies.

This series offers fast-paced action, an everyman hero, and a touch of romance, all tied together with a tough cord of faith.",3,"[-3.442106595277885, -1.7865117238944581, -1.3123930924118208, -0.9790813036017477, -0.9817914294810801]",-0.9790813036017477

1269,"Contrary to most reviewers, I see the Breeds as the villains of this book. All of them.

The leading lady, S--, saw her father and brother murdered by Breeds when she was 14. Dad gives her a datachip along with rediculously ambiguous instructions on how to recognize this person. That person never shows up, or perhaps simply never gives her the (never clearly defined) signal. S-- has lived on the run ever since.

The ""nasty"" Breeds from the Council have been hounding S--, attacking her, demand the datachip, attempting to kidnap her, and generally making her life miserable ever since.  The ""heroic"" Breeds from other books knew what happened, and knew where S-- was fairly quickly.  They never lift a finger to help her. They never once do ANYTHING positive for her. Instead, they chase S--, hound her, make her life miserable, attack her, demand the datachip, attempt to kidnap her, and generally make her life miserable.

So basically, the ""good"" Breeds act exactly like the Council Breeds!

Near the opening of the book, the ""heroic"" Breeds kidnap S-- and hold her prisoner for the rest of the book. They accuse HER of being a bigot, which is quite unreasonable. Why should she trust them? What proof has she ever had -- ever! -- that the Breeds are anything other than violent and selfish?  None. Zip, zero, zilch. They make nasty threats toward S-- with high regularity. Her captors inundate her with their own tales of woe, belittling S--'s problems, self justifying their own crimes, and never lifting a finger to help anyone outside of their own community.

The captors brain wash her to convince S-- that she is the unreasonable one, and they are all perfect goody-two-shoes.  By the end of the book, S-- has no will left of her own, and agrees that she was wrong all along.

It's supposed to be a nice relaxing weekend, but when Chyna hears an intruder in the night, plans soon turn array.  Chyna quickly turns into survival mode when she suspects an intruder.  Having been sheparded around most of her young life with a neglectful mother and her mother's abusive boyfriends, Chyna knows how to run and hide to survive.  Her instincts tell her when to hide and when to move and serve her pretty well.  The intruder, Edglar Vess, appears to be a very efficient killing machine.  When Chyna is able to get to the other rooms in the house, she discover the Templetons dead and posed for gruesome effect.  Chyna is determined to find out who the killer is and ensure he pays for the destruction he's caused.  It will take all her courage, strength, and determination to make it through and come out alive.

The book delivered on its promise, it really was an intense ride.  Edglar Vess is definitely a messed up guy.  He likes to live with intensity and doesn't value pleasure over pain.  They are all sensations that should be taken in.  He loves to inflict psychological and physical pain on his victims and appears to be very good at it.  Very disturbing.  There were many times during the book I couldn't believe that Chyna was pressing on.  It was like a horror movie where you scream at the girl to run out of the house, but instead she runs up the stairs.  Chyna kept perpetually putting herself back in danger to get to the truth.  I thought it would really get on my nerves, but ended up not being too bad.

Combe Island is a secure location for the powerful to seek respite. When a famed writer is found hanged in the island's lighthouse, authorities aren't certain whether it was suicide or murder.

Hoping to avoid unwanted publicity, government sidesteps the local constabulary and sends in Commander Adam Dalgliesh and his team to discretely sort out the situation.

Ever responsive to duty, Dalgliesh accepts the assignment even though it means another disruption in his ongoing courtship of Emma Lavenham.

Coping with her own emotional problems, Detective Inspector Kate Miskin is handed another as she must now supervise the ambitious and ambivalent Sergeant Francis Benton-Smith.

The team has barely begun sorting out the clues which determine the first was murder when they are confronted with a second brutal slaying. James complicate the situation further by throwing in a contagious disease that puts Dalgliesh in jeopardy and throws more responsibility on Kate. Despite his health problems, it is still AD who comes up with the solution.

As is usual in her novels, action is slowed down to allow ample opportunity for us to get to know the characters and the location. For some all the description and back story may be a distraction.

247,"What I Loved: I loved seeing Amy back in the wild, surviving on her own with such skill. That was easily the best part of the the first book, just being in her head as she did what she needed to in order to survive. You get a good amount of that here, too, before shes forced to dive back into the world of New Hope. Yes, much of the book is of Amy in Fort Black like how she was in New Hope, although both places are completely different, but I actually enjoyed all the sides of the story  the After, New Hope, Fort Black and I think Lunetta did a great job of balancing all three environments and mixing them together to form a cohesive story. I also think Amy is a fantastic main character, with such strength and such a big heart, especially given the circumstances. I think the strongest element Lunetta had in this duology was Amy.

Left Me Wanting More: I wasn't too keen on the romance. There is a sort of love triangle going on, but thankfully, its not the main focus of the story and rightly so as it didn't sway me either way. Both guys had their strong points and were key players at different parts of Amys lives, but I didn't really see her with either one. Im glad that there was so much more to the story than the romance, and I enjoyed Amy and Babys relationship more anyways. I wish that had been explored more in this book as much as in the first book. Ill admit, the build-up kind of took too long, and the ending was too easily attained, but I still enjoyed the flow of the story nonetheless.

Final Verdict: I really enjoyed this book and this series so much, more than I thought I would. I love it when that happens. I think Lunetta does an excellent job of capturing your attention right away with this quasi-realistic, post-apocalyptic world and she definitely keeps your attention until the very end.

This is book 3 in her Bounty Hunters series and they keep getting better and better for me.
I love my alpha males and Ford is on the top of the list. We met him in the previous stories and now it is his turn to have his story told.
I don't remember reading much if any about Dana in the prior stories but we sure get to know him now.
These 2 men work for Duke and Quick and are now partners. In the beginning they work together and get along fine then all of sudden Ford is having issues with Dana. Dana doesn't know why.
Ford is older (46) and Dana is younger (33) but sometimes they both act like children when they get on each other nerves. It starts out, I would say, as a love hate thing but turns into a hot as Haiti's relationship.
Dana has had a crush on Ford from the beginning and doesn't know why he is so mean to him lately. Dana thinks Ford is straight so he doesn't pursue anything with him.
Ford, for is part is done with dealing with Dana's antics.
Once these 2 start getting together it will burn your kindle. The chemistry is off the charts and as usual AE knows how to spice things up in the bedroom.
I am always drawn to her characters because as you will read they are all flawed but in the end are willing to give love a shot.
I would suggest you read the first 2 books in this series to find out more about all the other men in the story. It is a great series as are all AE's series.
If you want a fast paced action packed story then Iwould recommend AE and all her series to you. Just try one and you will be hooked with her writing and her art of story telling.

Their interactions are antagonistic, heated, and dripping in sexual tension...when they are not doing their best to ignore each other. They are the powder keg in their friend group just waiting to explode.

Their past both ties them together and puts up barriers. She hides her emotions and strives to be perfect all the time. She longs for safety and security. He is quiet, brooding, witty, intelligent, and intimidating to most. He is dangerous...at least to her heart. They try hard to keep each other at a distance, but both long for more and keep that hidden at least from each other. He is closed off from her. She's scared of more rejection and guards her heart. Everyone knows they belong together, but they are both clueless.

They tease, taunt, and drive each other nuts. He makes her feel alive, but also scares her senseless. He is obsessed with keeping her safe, but hates that she feels indebted to him. Their communication skills need a lot of work. Most of the time they end up fighting, insulting, or walking away from the other.

Both hate showing vulnerability and losing control. But it just takes on moment of true closeness to open up the floodgates. Even when they begin to give into temptation, they still have a lot of issues to wade through. Their past, their hidden feelings, regrets misunderstandings, fears, and outside influences are challenging to them.

They are volatile in every way--sometimes good, sometimes bad, always intense and entertaining.

I loved Archer and Elle together. Even during their denial, they were friends who acted like enemies, but would be there for the other no matter what. But acting on their attraction is only part of the problem, and they still have issues to face for a chance at more. And nothing is ever easy with these two. I was glad to get both of their points of view in order to see what was really going on in their heads.

Their whole friend group is quirky and fun. They've all had more of a clue about Elle and Archer throughout the series as their sexual tension and feelings were a poorly kept secret.

Lucas was determined and eventually he took over the title of Mr. FK if you haven't read other ebooks by this author before don't worry you'll understand the joke as you read. But the question is how long will he hold his newly found title?

Lucas is sarcastic and smart and when it comes to the ladies he's a total player but lately seeing his friends settle down, not into romantic lives but in their businesses he's found that he's not quite as happy as you used to be with traveling all over the world.

When the one man he never hope to hear from starts trying to contact him Lucas is determined to keep him away but when one feisty new PA softens him enough to read a letter by the elusive businessman will it be the beginning of not just one but many changes in his life?

Jade really needed a new job and being the PA for an affluent businessman is the perfect fit for her but getting involved in his personal life was not something she ever anticipated especially when it comes to one hunky man by the name of Lucas Reaner.

She is smart in many was but has been burned in the love department one too many times. But as she keep seeing more and more of Lucas she sees the possibility of more for the first time in a long time. But when the secrets of his true relationship with her boss comes to light will it cause things between them two fall apart before they ever really get a chance?

They both know Lucas has secrets with her boss but this time around it's not secrets I get the best of them it's their unwillingness to open up about the possibilities of their relationship.

One of the things I like about how the author works is she build one series and then with the sideline characters another series is created so the people you wonder about you find out in great new ways and you get to see glimpses of past characters. But even if you've never read any of her books you still get a great story because each of them works well as a stand alone.

About the Author:

Author Sharon Srock went from science fiction to Christian fiction at slightly less than warp speed. Twenty five years ago, she cut her writer's teeth on Star Trek fiction. Today, she writes inspirational stories that focus on ordinary women using their faith to accomplish extraordinary things. A member of the American Christian Fiction Writers, Sharon serves her local chapter in the role of treasurer. Sharon lives in the middle of nowhere Oklahoma with her husband and three very large dogs.

My Review:

 Pam had suffered many years of taunting and abuse from her ex husband. She took to sleeping pills and solitude for help, but that never seem to comfort her. When she finally become aware of his ""extra-curricular"" activities she ended it with a visit to the lawyers office. A few years later after she thought that their relationship was water under the bridge, he returns with his new wife.

 Forgiveness is all he wants, he realizes the way he treated Pam was wrong. She moved on and remarried as did he, but with death lingering he needed to know she forgave him. He wants to leave their children with the fact that he is a Christian and that their mother forgave him. But that is going to be hard to accomplish because she doesn't trust him enough to forgive him. God is definitely going to have to intervene here because without Him the situation seems hopeless.

This story of a woman that has deeply hurt and trying to move on and then she gets a chance to forgive the one person she never thought would hurt her is such a true to life story. A story full of pain and yet full of heartfelt devotion with a strong plot-line. It is an excellent addition to The Women of Valley View series.

498,"Let me start by saying that I generally love historical mysteries. They intrigue me and educate me about a time and place that I am not familiar with. I was looking forward to C.J. Sansom's ""Dissolution"", a mystery that takes place in a monastery during the English Reformation. However, the setting proved to be not my cup of tea. That being said, the book definitely has redeeming qualities.

C.J. Sansom has definitely researched this time period well, and his concluding historical note clarifies many of the points made in his book. It all begins in November 1537 when Dr. Matthew Shardlake, a lawyer working for Lord Thomas Cromwell in London, is asked to go to the Monastery of St. Donatus in southern England. One of Cromwell's commissioners, Robin Singleton, had been down there trying to negotiate the monks' surrender to Henry VIII. However, Singleton was found beheaded, and it is up to Shardlake and his assistant, Mark Poer, to discover who committed the heinous crime.

On the first night of their stay, another tragedy unfolds when a young novice, Simon Whelpy, becomes ill and dies a day later. The infirmist suspects poisoning, and the fact that Whelpy died before telling Shardlake about another possible murder leads Matthew to suspect that more is going on. Stories begin to circulate about a young woman working at the monastery who went missing a few years earlier, and there is the matter of the church being desecrated and a precious relic stolen.

It seems that the longer Shardlake stays, the more complex the mystery gets. What is truth and what is being made up to continue a way of life that may not be in the best interests of society? How much of the terror in London is real and how much was Cromwell's creation? Whom can Shardlake trust?

The book was interesting, and it definitely picked up toward the end. However, I can't give it five stars. Perhaps this is my own fault, as I learned that Tudor England doesn't interest me as much as I thought it did. C.J. Sansom wrote an intriguing novel, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.",2,"[-2.686084692951468, -1.809700518243722, -1.3532416705424668, -1.007458797388096, -0.9833241107983033]",-0.9833241107983033

They travel as a band on a tour bus, with Lizzies dear friends that are brothers, Jarrett and Rhett, along with her Uncle Bruce as the driver.  She lives for this life and the band.
  Cannon Blackwell comes into the story as a hot musician left alongside the highway with nothing but his duffel bag and guitar.  The band is in need of a musician so Lizzie saunters over inviting Cannon to be part of the band, as long as he passes a security check and drug test.  He is up for an adventure so agrees.  This is one outspoken, sexy, fun, flirty guy that can be pushy when required.  Could Cannon be real enough to help Lizzie let go of her past and move forward with her future and happiness?
  Lizzie is a feisty, hilarious, controlling lead of the band and over protective Mama Bear to the guys.  She becomes Cannons siren drawing him in and his effect on Lizzie is calming.  They start out as friends quickly moving a bit too fast to the next stage when you consider the timeline of the story.  She is still guarded but love and true friendship prevails.  The story is about acceptance, forgiveness, and letting go.  By the end of the book, she does a total 360 thanks to Cannon.
  When I started reading the book, I was not sure I was going to like it.  The story seemed slow and I was not sure about a book of a traveling band.  However, S.E.

With a degree in design, the idea of accepting a job with a branding company seems brilliant, but her salary is small and the area of London where she's found an affordable flat is no where close to the office. Unfortunately, none of that matters when she's faced with her brilliant new boss, Demeter. The title, ""Most Disorganized Human Being,"" doesn't seem to be an over estimation. Demeter seems to always be making statements that she, in utter confusion minutes later, retracts or tries to make sense of. Only her personal assistant seems able to keep her from disaster. She even seems to forget that she's failed to make an employee ""redundant"" or fired, as the English say.  Anyway, while Demeter keeps things interesting at the office, Katie is besieged with problems as simple as difficult bangs to as overwhelming as her computer's sudden death. Her budget doesn't leave room for extras, but for Katie to work on her designs at home, she must buy a functioning computer. Just as you're wondering what else could go wrong, a fabulous man enters her life almost as her job exits it.

3651,"Faith Andrews has written an engaging story in Man of my Dreams. It is a story of mistakes, regrets, second chances, and of course love. The characters are vibrant and the plot was interesting and had me pulled in from the very beginning. The book flashes back and forth between present and past but it is very easy to follow and getting bits of the past helped tell the story in the present.
Mia is upset with her husband, Declan (LOVE that name!) for problems in their marriage and while they are separated, runs into her high school crush Noah. To be honest, I wasn't sure which man I wanted to root for at first. Both are sexy, successful, and have a soft spot for Mia. Neither one of them are really bad guys which made it difficult. As I progressed through the book, I started leaning more towards Declan mostly because of the lengths he went to to win her heart (both times) despite his mistake. Mia had me cursing at her a few times during the book because of her indecision. All 3 of these main characters felt like real people and grew quite fond of them, especially Mia and Declan. Mias best friend had me cracking up several times and I also liked all of the other secondary characters.
This story was a bit of a nail biter at times but I truly enjoyed it. Once I started the book, I couldn't put my tablet down until I was finished.

However, she's currently dealing with an ex, a possessive one, that obviously has trouble letting go. When a sexy firefighter steps in, pretending to be her boyfriend, she rolls with it, and later thoroughly enjoys the explosive sex that follows.

Tyler isn't exactly following the decree to avoid danger while dealing with the loss of his best friend a few months prior when he begins his ruse to rescue the gorgeous woman, but he can't resist helping, nor acting on their mutual attraction.

However, though they are definitely in agreement sexually, the same can't be said professionally as they're on opposing sides of a proposed firebreak. Their viewpoints make their newfound fake relationship shaky as they continue the charade due to Abbi's ex. Though Abbi only does temporary, and Tyler was in agreement as he'll be returning home soon, what was once fake is suddenly becoming all too real.

Can Tyler and Abbi overcome not only their differences, but also the demons they both struggle with? Will Abbi learn to trust Tyler, a difficult task considering what she experienced as a teenager? If the firebreak is approved, what will that mean for Abbi's job? What happens when Tyler's time in Gold Mountain is over? Will Abbi's ex finally get the hint and leave her alone? Will Tyler find peace in regards to his loss? Can these two have a HEA?

1897,"Young author Britton uses a, ""What if the enemy is one of us?"" scenario in a somewhat typical, but still enjoyable thriller.  And while my 4-star rating may be a little generous, it's still a pretty impressive debut.

The story is pretty simple.  Ryan Kealey, a 33-year-old retired former Special Forces op, is drawn back into the national security game when a suspected terrorist is revealed to be a former officer once under Kealey's command.  From there, it's typical cat-and-mouse stuff, with a couple of love interest storylines thrown in for good measure.

While not on the level of Tom Clancy's military thrillers, this is a nice debut from Britton.  Kealey is a believable hero, even if he seems a little Jack Bauer-ish at times with the threats of torture and unbridled use of violent means.  Anyone who likes a fast-moving story, and one that doesn't necessarily command you to be constantly figuring things out, should enjoy this one.  Hopefully, Britton's next novel will iron out some of the problems evident in this one, and he'll be able to tell a story in fewer pages.

Overall, a good debut effort.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",3,"[-2.6789931915121414, -1.7381074656926803, -1.1157805810377603, -0.9857535580626984, -1.315697525225167]",-0.9857535580626984
45,"For this reader Baker Towers held a very personal message.  It reversed the passage of time and took me on a vicarious trip back to the small town of my youth.  In describing Bakerton, Jennifer Haigh accurately captured the essence of small town America in the 1940's , 50's and 60's where parents from the ""old country"" worked hard in an attempt to ensure that their offspring would have a chance at the American Dream. Haigh's Bakerton could easily have been the small, predominently Polish, steel-mill town I grew up in on the South Side of Chicago. Its Baker Towers definietly brought back memories of steel waste poured down the hill adjacent to the mills that became the ""slag heaps"" that burned brightly and lit the night sky.

As for the members of the Novak family, they could have been the my cousins, or the kids next door, or some of my school chums.......all bent on leading more fulfilling lives than their parents.  Like the Novaks, some stayed to live and work among parents, family and friends while others pursued other avenues and a life away from the mills.  Yet no matter how far away they traveled or what their accomplishments, that small town would always welcome them home.

This bittersweet tale of our industrial past evokes not only feelings of nostalgia, but vividly presents us with an intimate look at a time in our history when family and friends worked together toward a common goal.  This was the time before our manufacturing cities became known as ""The Rust Belt"" and  we actually employed people to produced more than hamburgers, and finally it was a time when folks had a genuine love and pride in this country.",3,"[-3.6128488602737736, -1.4047940284973244, -1.1755685855834934, -1.0054974083578734, -0.9859169912856731]",-0.9859169912856731

I am truly grateful for this generosity. I really appreciate the time, effort and expense it takes to make a reviewer copy available to me.

Dee Henderson's latest novel, ""Full Disclosure,"" is well-worth the long wait!  The reunion with several of the O'Malleys had my heart beating double-time!  Or was it the author's gift for crafting a suspenseful plot?  Or perhaps it was learning the identities of the True Heroes cast of characters.  In any case, this book started off at a run because I caught myself reminiscing over books I've enjoyed and characters I've considered friends, embraced the twist that incorporated them into this novel and invested my armchair sleuthing skills into figuring out who the Lady Shooter is.

Paul Falcon is the top murder investigator for the FBI.  His investigation of the Lady Shooter case has gone cold a long time ago.  But this trail is about to heat up.  Ann Silver is the top murder investigator with any agency that requests her help as the Midwest Homicide Investigator (MHI).  When Ann cracks a code that leads to a break in the Lady Shooter case Paul is working on, she hands over all of her evidence over to Agent Falcon.  And Paul thinks he's finally met the woman of his dreams.

""Full Disclosure"" is a high tension suspense read.  Although the narrative of this Advance Reading Copy lost me for a bit in the middle of the book, I pushed through to the thrilling conclusion.  Ann is a very unique character - flexible, not desiring fame or glory, deliberate in all she does.  These are just a few of the ways I would like to be like her.  Paul is dedicated and doting and observant - a few of the character traits I would also like to possess.  The Lady Shooter case is a solid story that unfolds in surprising ways.

1237,"I first became familiar with Sarah Vowell's work via her radio appearances on NPR's ""This American Life"". While she brings an unapologetically slightly left of center view to her work, she also brings the subjects she examines to vivid life in ways that are insightful, humorous and reflect strong academic discipline. While her overall approach may be not be appreciated by staid historiographers, for those looking to plug gaps in their knowledge of historical subjects: she is a great resource.

""Lafeyette in the Somewhat United States"" explores the role of the teenage general, Gilbert de Motier, Marquis de Lafayette in the American Revolution. Centered on Lafayette and his access to the military and financial might of France in assisting the US colonies, it expands in a series of other examinations, to include Lafayette's relationship with George Washington, the politics of colonial military command and the larger evolution of diplomatic relations between France and the colonies.

Vowell is very effective at providing context on what is really going on in the background of the rather staid documentary records of events from the late 18th century. She does this in ways that are often laugh out loud funny and useful for providing contexts on issues we face in the modern world.

I started placing dog ears on the funniest passages as I read...and then stopped, because she is witty at every turn, and she uses this wit to effectively illuminate what she writes about. About his arrival in Charleston, Vowell quotes Lafayette's letter: ""Everything around me was new...the room, the bed draped in delicate mosquito curtains, the black servants who to me quietly to ask my commands...the luxuriant vegetation..."". Then she provides this interpretation: ""In other words, it was a buggy swamp full of slaves."" While some might bristle at such irreverence, it has the undeniable quality of bringing life to the often stodgy presentation of traditional history.

I grew up in parts of New Jersey that the armies described in this book traversed while moving men and materials between New York and Philadelphia. No teacher or local historical society ever succeeded in bringing the history of the area to live as Sarah Vowell does here (although Annie Garvin came close!).

Meanwhile, a private collector has obtained a holy relic concealing a vial of  1st century blood, which he opens, unleashing a doomsday plague upon the world.
Swift, trying to save a remote Himalayan Neandertal discovery from Ochs' plundering, survives a murderous attack only to be cast in jail when he drags himself out of the mountains. When the guards abandon his Tibetan prison in the midst of the plague, Swift begins his odyssey back to his daughter in America, through emptied countryside, across Siberia and to Alaska. Meanwhile, new labs at Los Alamos hunt for a vaccine by cloning humans from Year Zero - crucifixion victims who may have antibodies for a less virulent form of the virus.
Searching for Ochs, Swift finds his way from the Smithsonian to Los Alamos with a collection of first-century relics. While nobody seems to have any great regard for the human rights of the crucified clones (whose memories of their past lives and death are intact) Swift joins forces with a 19-year-old compassionate genius against the Ochs faction and starts getting to know the clones.

Rather his two NY based unofficial ""partners"" - Angel and Louis - are the ""stars"" - with Louis taking ""Top Billing"". Angel and Louis are ""bad guys"", who since meeting Charley - and in this author's hands - fight the good fight - with any and all means justifying the end.  And for those of you familiar with the series, the ""ends"" can be very violent ones indeed as Charlie has a knack of pitting himself, with Angel and Louis at his side or covering his back, against some incredibly evil beings.

Louis is the quintessential enigmatic character, the reader privy to just bits and pieces of his history from the earlier books. In The Reapers, we learn of Louis' past as it all catches up with him - With Louis, Angel - and eventually Charlie - fighting for their lives in a deadly cat and mouse ""game"".

The Reapers is somewhat of a change of pace in the Parker series, besides the protagonist shift, this is more of a straightforward thriller than a ""mystery"", and there is a minimal amount of the supernatural that lurks in the previous books. Still the writing is excellent - with tidbits of dark humor sprinkled throughout - there is an excellent supporting cast, and the plot will keep you turning the pages.

4570,"Raths Deception by Pier Platt is the first novel in a series called The Janus Group. After becoming an orphan at a young age and fending for himself on the streets of Tarkis, Rath is recruited by the Janus Group to become a sought after intergalactic assassin. The contract is for 50 kills. If the contract assassin survives 50 kills, then he or she is entitled to 50% of the money that the Janus group made on that contractor's kills. Its an enticing prospect, but intense prospect for a destitute young man who has never killed anyone. As Rath progresses through the grueling training and his kills mount, he becomes aware that there is something not quite honest about the Janus group. Simultaneously, the police are constantly on the hunt for a way to bring down the Janus group, which is essentially a group of highly trained and efficient murderers. Meanwhile, Rath must figure out a way to complete his 50 kills and retrieve the money that he was promised.

This is an action packed and unique novel. I really enjoyed every part of it. Rath is trained by the Janus group to become a killer, but he is still a sympathetic character. Rath is a determined, but ultimately becoming a world weary man, focused on this one objective. However, knowing his back story makes it hard not to like him. Meanwhile, the Group only seems to become more vicious and ruthless as the novel progresses. The police detective and reporter that are trying to track down the contract killers are an excellent addition to the story, because then the reader doesnt have to hear about each of Raths kills and the story moves forward. I also really liked the little insights into the Janus Groups operations that are revealed during Raths missions and the use of 3D printer-like technology. The one thing that I didn't like about the novel was that it was hard to tell how much time had passed from chapter to chapter. Overall, it was fast paced and action packed story.

The narration by James Fouhey was well done. Each of the characters was distinguishable and the voicing fit the characters. The production quality was good as well. I would recommend this story to anyone who likes action packed stories about rebel assassins mixed with a police mystery.

1947,"Characters: Charlotte Withersby is both the heroine and the narrator of this beautiful story, and I loved getting to know her. At 28, she is a bit old to be looking for a husband by society's standards, and as a woman botanist, she is anything but conventional. Her approach to society and her views on ""etiquette"" are humorous and fresh. I found her to be quite unique and she is probably going to be one of my favorite characters that I have come across.

Storyline: This novel had a lot to offer in it's story. Most of it involved the characters learning to come into their own. Charlotte had to accept who she is and figure out what she wanted out of life and this is the bulk of the story. There are a number of characters who come up alongside her and help her to figure out where she fits in the world that she is living in.

My Thoughts:  Like a Flower in Bloom was a joy to read. Refreshing best describes it, I think. It stands out to me as being quite unique for its genre. There were a myriad of floral and botany references, all of which added a bit of depth to the characters. The author definitely did her research with this book as well with a number of references to events that happened in the era concerning botany, flora, and society (the historical in the note points out some of these things).

We had previously used Natural Balance Sweet Potato and Fish for our larger dogs and noticed that Ginger (the Yorkie) would scrounge around on the floor after they were done eating.  Whenever she got lucky, she would spend quite a bit of time trying to chew the kibble up, a daunting task with her few remaining choppers.  So we decided to get this Small Bite edition of the same Natural Balance formula.

After boarding her at a kennel for five days while we took a short trip, when we returned home we automatically put down her normal wet food, a bowl of water, and as usual a dish with some of this Small Bite kibble.  She ignored the wet food and immediately scarfed up the kibble.  Boy were we surprised!  The other great advantage is that her previously challenged digestive system has calmed down and she is back to a normal eating and elimination schedule.  No upset tummy and no accidents.

Using a grain-free dog food obviously has been beneficial for her.  If Ginger could say ""thank you"" I know that she would.  We are all very pleased at the results.",4,"[-2.5680395408421064, -1.1447098267360047, -1.0545741974204133, -0.9875933276122764, -1.481347370311709]",-0.9875933276122764

However she hardly has time to settle before her world is turned upside down when she finds out there are many more supernaturals in the world besides just werewolves. Witches, Half-Demons, Shamans, and Vampires are just a few of these races, and they have a governing body called the Council. Someone is kidnapping supernaturals and the Council calls on the werewolves to help. However reluctant they may be to get involved, Elena's conscience in the end prevails. The Pack sets out to investigate these kidnappings, and find a few of the thugs. However, Elena soon finds herself in the hands of the captors and it becomes a fight for her life as well as some new friends along the way.

This book touches on things that I think would be a real issue for supernaturals if they existed. The first thing humans would want to do would be to experiment on these supernaturals, and that is exactly what the captors in this book are doing. The leader of this project wasn't quite enough of a menace for my tastes, but in the end his arrogance does make his character believable. The book was mostly lacking the great dynamic between Clay and Elena from the previous book. This is of course understandable considering they were apart most of the book, but I found I missed it. Elena hold true to her strong kick-ass character throughout this book and even in the roughest of situations she never breaks down.

836,"As many others have said, this book is not easy to review.  Although it was riveting and well written, its certainly not an easy read.  Author Jon Krakauer has produced an important work about the radical fringe of the Mormon faith - Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints.  The story is harrowing and extremely thought-provoking.  Krakauer builds the book around a gruesome double murder of a young mother and toddler at the hands of her brothers-in-law; who claim direction from god for this horrendous deed.  He takes us into the world of Mormon Fundamentalism; a blood-soaked world of rigid patriarchal control, child brides, forced isolation, brainwashing, and polygamy.  Krakauer them details the early history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  We learn about the mercurial founder Joseph Smith.  He details the early LDS group's forced migration from Palmyra, New York, through Ohio, Missouri, to Nauvoo, Illinois, and finally the 1800 mile exodus to the Great Salt Salt Lake in Utah.  Along the way, besides Smith, we learn about Brigham Young and other key early church leaders, the bloody violence of the early years, and the ""Book of Mormon"" with all its contradictions and problems.
This is an extremely eye-opening work which I highly recommend.  Because Mormonism is so new, we're privlidged to much more detail about the founders and early years of this religion.  Its a wonder to me how anyone actually buys this story, much less lives by its tenants every day.  The church's long and fraudulent flirtation with polygamy and virtual slavery of very young women should be enough in itself to warn off thinking individuals.  But another thought also comes to mind - is this religion that much different from the early history of any of the major world religions?  We know very little details about the founding of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, or any number of other faiths.  If we were privileged to as much detail about them as we are to Mormonism, would the story be much different?

Kyle Connor has no idea why the love of his life, Amber, disappeared 6 years ago but eventually he moved on to living his life although he has never gotten over her. He became a musician and starting getting a name for himself.

When Amber and Kyle run into each other they discover the mistakes of the past were all a misunderstanding and they are ready to try again. Unfortunately in a small town there are still those who can not get over the past and will do anything to keep them apart.

This was a great book on jumping to conclusions and making amends for past mistakes. It's about forgiveness and living the life you want.

Amber held onto her hatred so much for Kyle without every hearing his side of the story and I think once she heard what happened she felt so bad yet she knew that things happened for a reason. She was ready to make amends to the mistakes and was so happy to get the second chance with Kyle.

Kyle made his mistakes with his rock n' roll past but he knew that it was due to never getting over Amber. As soon as he could he was honest with her and told Amber everything. He was extremely possessive of Amber and didn't want anything or anyone to get between them.

I love the friends surrounding them, especially Holly and Paul! I loved the link of Beasley and how he protected Amber at all cost.

Bea knew what it meant to have no family so when given the opportunity to create her own family in college, she took that chance.  She had been sick with leukemia as a child and knew life was precious.  She did take lots of chances with her life; but she just enjoyed her life as it was given to her.  She met Catherine, Owen, Collin, Lindy, and Annie in the freshman dorm when they all entered college.  They lived in the old part of the dorms and came together within a few weeks due to a fire in the dorm.  Bea knew Catherine, Lindy, and Annie as they lived next to each other and had gotten to at least know each others names in the short time they were there.  Collin and Annie had met the first day and Owen and Collin were close to each other on a different floor.  Owen and Catherine were already a couple from high school.  When the fire broke out, Bea got Catherine and together they woke Lindy and Annie up.  When they got outside, they gravitated towards Collin, who Bea knew, and Owen.  Four years later, they wrote letters to themselves for a time capsule Bea put together.  She said they would get together twenty years from then and read their letters.  Then they went their various ways and led their own lives.  Now they are gathered once more because of Bea.  Bea had died and asked her lawyer to have them gather together on July 4 to finish out her will.  What else does Bea have up her sleeve?  Why does she want them together again after all this time?

As I watched the account of this woman's life I was in constant agony for I felt for her and her situation, her horrific lot in life.  Aileen Wuornos (Charlize Theron) is not the monster here.  The monster is the life she led, the life forced upon her, the life that ate at her everyday.  Aileen, prostitute since thirteen, never knew anything more than what she had, and as the film opens we see that she is about to take her own life because of this, that was until she meets Selby Wall (Christina Ricci).  Selby (real name was Tyria Moore) is a closet lesbian who wants to come out against the will of her overbearing parents.  She meets Aileen in a gay bar, a place apparently Aileen was unaware was a gay bar, but after they meet they lose something they've felt their whole life...they no longer feel lonely, alone.

In order to keep Selby by her side Aileen turns back to prostitution but after being abused horrifically by a 'John' Aileen makes a change.  That's when the murders begin, and even though some are not justified and some are heartbreaking (especially when she murders and innocent man out of pure fear and hopelessness) you never feel as though she deserves what she gets.  She didn't deserve the hand she was dealt and its heart wrenching to see her have to go through everything she went through.  Yes, it's true that not all women who are raped by their father figure turn out to be murderers, but I don't feel that's the reason she killed.  There is so much we don't know about the woman that was Aileen Wuornos, but from Charlize's brilliant performance we gather that she was afraid, she was alone, she was confused and she was emotionally dieing if not already dead.  She had been abused in everyway possible and thrown out without a chance, without a care in the world, even by the ones she loved the most (most notably Selby).

This is a truly heartbreaking and, yes, painful film to watch but it's one that we all do well to experience to know the tragedy we ourselves are at times too guarded (and judgmental) against.",3,"[-0.9881396266181327, -1.0234710351869636, -1.0513584831080585, -0.991132961871254, -1.1404138963352288]",-0.9881396266181327

 Oh, wow and I thought the first part was good...

This is the second book in the Take Me (Power Play) series by Kelly Harper and I am now a big fan of this authors work.  I really enjoyed this eighty three page novella, it was hot, sexy, and very enjoyable.  I read this book as quickly as I read the first and I must say it was hard to put down.

The story continues with the sexy Brit Isaac Drake and Declan Cross, the two significant men in Hannah Barnes life. The relationship, which started in book one between Isaac and Hannah is continued, but Hannah thinks that the relationship is moving too fast, so they have a first date.  There were some laugh out loud moments with this first date scenario, as they seemed to break every rule that Isaac had created.  She really opens herself up to Isaac, which sees a real grown in Hanaahs character.

Declans character becomes a little stalker like in this book and there is a deep secret he is keeping from Hanaah which threatens her world.  Declan shows a jealous side, which is strange considering he is a friend, not a friend with benefits.  I am looking forward to seeing which direction Declans character will head.

There is a freaking cliff hanger at the end, and I am now clamoring for the next book in the series.  This book was nailed as far as I was concerned, I am absolutely itching for book three in this series and I like Declan will now stalk the author.

 I gave this book five stars, go grab yourself a copy today, I can thoroughly recommend the series.",4,"[-2.838923282410989, -1.5950096979429231, -1.2096277525136219, -0.9882787330228122, -1.230517623684558]",-0.9882787330228122

I think it was a little if a couple if things--the flow within scenes and between, romantic descriptions if scenes being the same and the lack of feeling truly connected to the characters. I liked the characters just would have liked to have more. It begins in our time then Maggie our young adult is whisked to the past (1621) by a bloodstone (magical rock). She finds herself immediately saved by Indian native (Winn) who surprisingly, knows about Time Walkers; the only thing is, he has orders from the Chief to kill all Time Walkers, but he can't kill her. A romance takes place, of course, Despite objection from Indians as well as whites. Suddenly, Maggie is thrust into the arms of the jameston locals. Bereft from tragedy she gets a new history lesson on the brutality of the white man then. to save her baby growing in her womb, she agrees to marry Benjamin ( winn's white friend, who's more like a brother.) The town discovers her Timewalker status and casts her as a witch and set out to hang her. Will Benjamin save her? Will someone else? And what about the white man will he keep any if his promises to the Indians while she's there or can she help them? Will she? Adult only read because of the sex scenes and the battles.

I read For the Rest of Her Life by Ms. Moriarty as well, so I hoped I would like this one too! Not surprisingly, I did :) This book deals with issues surrounding divorce, and I'm always intrigued by how people handle it. Maybe its because I'm an attorney that works in family and divorce law, or maybe it's just because I know so many people that have gone through this. Either way, I enjoyed this story. Veronica tries so hard to accept her parents divorce and move on. But slowly, things start going wrong; she can't concentrate, she is having troubles with her boyfriend, and is falling behind in school. We can all relate with the problems she's having. But soon, her mom shows up at her dorm and desperately needs her help. Veronica doesn't really know what she can do, but tries anyways, because her mom doesn't have much after the divorce. Veronica is struggling with growing up, while her mom struggles to move past a divorce. It's an interesting story about a mother and daughters bond and friendship, I recommend it! It was a fast read, too; I read it in 2 days (:

Faye and Andrew were both headstrong and determined to win the game. Haunted with the past three years, Faye was determined to fight to stay and took everything Andrew dished out to her. Faye kept the past to herself; she wanted no one to find out the reason she came running back.

When Faye and Andrew were together the sexual tension screamed out for release.  Their sexual acts were vicious and disturbing however Faye was not going to give up until she got what she wanted  Andrew on his knees submitting to her. Andrew was not going to submit to anyone. Will he submit to Faye and keep her from running away again?

Taryn is the product of a home from which her mother fled and in which her father was physically abusive. She fled herself as a teenager and has since built a life for herself running a PR firm with several former NFL football players (from the Super Bowl-champion Los Angeles team). Angel, by contrast, has two types of scars: the visible one across his throat and the invisible from having lost his family in a tragedy. Both are determined not to fall in love, and so they believe it safe to enter into a relationship with each other. Their relationship becomes closer after Angel enlists Taryn's help with the Acorns, an organization he has volunteered for without realizing that he would be in charge of a group of young girls in a role similar to that of a den mother.

""When We Met"" did not strike me as a bad book, and the character of Taryn does seem fairly well drawn, from her determination to succeed in spite of her upbringing to her obsession with shoes and fashion to her fear of commitment. Still, there are some elements that strike me as rather hackneyed, including the small-town setting, and the ending seems rushed. Still, some of the attempts at humor, including the character of Consuelo (Angel's roommate) and the issue of the town motto struck me as deliberate attempts at humor that took me out of the story. They didn't seem organic. For example, at one point, Consuelo rather threateningly tells Taryn to make people stop bringing casseroles to Consuelo and Angel. Apparently, this gesture is too ""nice"" for the tough Consuelo.

I suppose I should note that the sex scenes are delayed in the book as Angel seems determined to wait a long time before touching Taryn, but once they start, they are moderately graphic.

Conquering is the second book in the Vipers Creed MC series by Ryan Michele.  I love the first book in this series, Challenged, and was excited to read an advanced copy of the second book.  Sometimes, the second book falls flat in a series, but Conquering is as awesome as the first book.

Conquering tells the story of Chelsea, who is a hardworking waitress always worrying and helping her family.  Her father is an immoral man who hasn't been around in years.  Stiff is a hardworking man who has done everything he could to help raise his brother, Xander, who has recently come home from the war.  Chelsea and Stiff have always had eyes for each other, but Stiff finally steps up when Jenn, Chelseas sister becomes hurt.  Their attraction ignites and becomes so hot and sexy.  The plot is great with just the right amount of drama, suspense, and passion.

Conquering is roughly 75 % of the book and then Ryan Michele offers us a treat by including Courageous, which is Xander and Gabbys story.  I have to be honest that I was not sure how I felt about Xander.  I thought he was a good clean cut type of guy, which is greatbut not my particular book boyfriend.  I can honestly say that Xander surprised me and I adore his story just as much as the others.

Sharn Macer is a 9th grade English teacher elected to be the faculty adviser for an after-school baseball program for at risk students. Keefer Smith is the baseball coach assigned to train Sharns students.  Sharn and Keefer know each other from their own high school days, but back then they ran in different circles. Now they aren't so different though. Their family backgrounds bear a lot of similarities, even when they don't realize it.

Overall the story is good. I enjoyed the inclusion of the students. Sharn and Keefer make a cute couple and in the small moments where they act like a couple they have a lot of potential. Unfortunately, there are also missed opportunities for romance in place of which there is a distinct lack of communication between two professional college graduates, which made it frustrating at times. I liked both of their characters; I just really wanted to see them show some more maturity in the way they handled a potential relationship.

This is the fifth (5) book in The Last Riders series and Jamie provides readers with enough background history to ensure that you can follow Cashs and Rachels story.

The story opens with Cash trying to get some pussy but he is cock blocked by the Porter brothers. Which is really funny. Cash decides he will ruffle some Porter Brother feathers by spending time with Rachel, their sister.

Cash is a member of The Last Riders motorcycle club. Prior to joining the MC, he has been a loner. The more I read about him, I realize that he has no emotional connection with anyone outside of the MC.

This changes when Cash sees Rachel again since he has returned.

Rachel is a novice and wholesome. She is patient and kind. She tolerates her brothers and their foolish but loves them so much.

Rachel has loved Cash since she was young. When Cash starts to pay attention to Rachel. The feelings that she begins to have deviously wet feelings for him (wagging my eyebrows) and this is unfamiliar to her. She is not use to that kind of attention from man. The love that Rachel has for family, passion and community is the same that wants to convey to Cash. Will Cash be receptive to her love, is he worthy of her? Can he be emotionally available to her?

I love MCs and this book was something new for me. The theme of book was not at all what I thought but how the author integrated this into the story line was fantastic.

My review has to be limited because; just the littlest of information will give this great story away. I can say the sex is good in the book. It is just enough to keep you wiggling in your seat.

This is the first book I read in the series but I was not lost at all. That is a great author. She gave me enough back-story of the previous books, to feel comfortable with the flow of Cashs book.

Happy Reading.

This is important because Bonnie Meadow is, according to it's mission statement, dedicated to emphasising the author's importance over the publisher's which is admirable but I'm not quite sure how this differs from others.

I only even bring this up because the FOUNDER of Bonnie Meadow is, well, Andrea Kane and this might lead some to treat this as a self-published work which, in the mind of more than a few diminishes it... which shouldn't be the case.

Kane is a solid, professional, writer who, while unfamiliar to me, appears to have quite a following

Moreover, this is the FIFTH book in the ""Forensic Instincts"" series and, although I am equally unfamiliar with the others in the series, I regret that because, not only is this book a lot of fun, the concept (a team of, more than a little, odd specialists who use their talents to help people in need) is one I have always loved from the ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" to the ""Monkey Wrench"" folks.

As Beth begins to settle in, Jack uses his resources to learn more about her, her husband's men again begin closing in, and a serial killer strikes in their little town.

2716,"As I was reading Edgar &  Lucy by Victor Lodato, I realized its been a while since Ive read such an excellent book. I loved this book from the very beginning to the very end.  Its a long book that you don't mind at all thats its long, as a matter of fact, I would have gladly kept reading had there been more story to tell.  But like the perfect book that it is, it ended on just the right note and left me completely fulfilled.

The title of the book refers to Edgar and his mother Lucy.  Lucy is widowed and a bit wild.  Edgar is a thoughtful child dealing with the ramifications of being an albino.

If I had to come with one word to describe this book it would be relationships.  Every relationship is so developed, complicated and intricate like they are in real life.  There is Edgar & Lucy, Edgar & Florence, Edgar & Conrad, Edgar & Jackie, Lucy & Florence, Lucy & Frank, Lucy & Ron, and even more smaller relationships.  When you finish reading the book, you feel like you know these people, that they are your friends.

While your getting to know all these characters and their relationships you are surrounded by prose so moving.  The writing so beautiful.  When we sit out on our back porch in the summer, we face an area of woods at the back of the lawn.  Sometimes when there is a breeze, all of the leaves are nodding at once.  Ive watched them and wished that I could describe it.  Well, Victor Lodato did and much more beautifully than I ever could:

The congress of leaves shivered and rolled, a voluptuous tossing that culminated in a vigorous nodding, as if all the trees agreed on something.  The decision was unanimous; the answer; yes.

This book has everything:  beautiful writing, excellent characters, and a few turns of plot that I didn't see coming at all.  Excellent.

I received an ARC of this book.",4,"[-2.852415856622575, -1.1849098496235813, -1.242034576659051, -1.0104571872429746, -0.9901000032136696]",-0.9901000032136696

Set in Seattle in dual time periods, 1909 and 1962, Ernest is raffled off at the age of twelve at the 1909 Seattle World's Fair and goes to live and work in a high class brothel. He is treated well there and becomes friends with Maisie, the daughter of the brothel's Madame Flora, and Fahn, a scullery maid at the brothel. In 1962, Ernest, through the coaxing of his journalist daughter, tells her his story of how he arrived in America, his time living in the brothel, and meeting Gracie there, his wife who is suffering from dementia.

I especially enjoyed the characters diversity, young, older, a boy with downs syndrome, all cared deeply for each other and worked together to solve their problem.

When police arrived at the Jakes home, they found the elderly Mr. Jakes savagely murdered and tied to his much younger wife, Angela, who had been brutally raped. With stolen art and jewels, the scene looks like a horrific burglary. Suspicion is placed on the young Mrs. Jakes, who survives the incident and whom Mr. Jakes left his entire fortune. Surprisingly, Angela leaves her entire windfall to a local charity, and disappears from LA. With his number one suspect/witness gone, Danny McGuire is left to ponder the case with no leads.

Ten years later, Danny McGuire, newly married, living in France, and working for Interpol, has all but moved on from the Jakes case. He is still haunted by the look in the young wife's eyes, but has accepted that he will never know the truth behind the killing. Then one day Matt Daley contacts him. Daley is a struggling scriptwriter who happens to be the estranged son of Andrew Jakes. In an attempt to discover a compelling story, he looks into his father's case and finds that other murders fitting the exact profile of his father's have occurred in various cities around the world. When he relays this information to Danny, the two embark on a fast paced, worldwide investigation to uncover the truth behind these murders.

Although the bestselling author, Sidney Sheldon, passed away in 2007, author Tilly Bagshawe continues his tradition of fast paced, intriguing mysteries in a expert manner. This story had as many plot twists as we've grown accustomed to in stories like this, and the ending is sure to leave readers reeling. The beginning of this novel has several time, location and character changes over a short number of pages. While this is vital to the telling of the story, I felt that the jumps could be a bit confusing. Fortunately, I stayed with it, and the last two-thirds of the novel were clearly written and very entertaining.

The novel is lush with vivid descriptions of the New Guinea landscapes, rivers, rainforests and indigenous people. I found myself hoping that a film would be made from it, especially after I looked up the Rainbow Gum Tree on the internet; its truly an amazingly beautiful specimen.
The story is set in the 1930s. Andrew Bankson is lonely and somewhat stagnant in his study of one of the Kiona river tribes, when fellow anthropologists, Fen and Nell arrive on the run from a hostile tribe. Andrew is desperate to keep them nearby for their company, and also for his attraction to Nell. There is a delightful scene where Andrew takes Fen and Nell, via canoe, tribe shopping along the river. They are to select their new tribe to study and its much like selecting a piece of real-estate; Nell is completely like a woman shopping for a house, looking for the perfect setting and amenities. She is bothered by the slightest detail of a place (a pair of picky anthropologists) until they meet the tribe on beautiful Lake Tam, where they settle. Thats all of the plot Ill give away!

2970,"I first read Zombie Fallout in July 2011 and then went on to read Zombie Fallout 2 and 3, all one after the other. The Zombie Fallout Series made it into almost all of my top 2011 lists and still remains one of my most recommended zombie books. I'm not the biggest re-reader - I'm always a little scared that I won't enjoy the book as much the second time around - but I'm so glad I went back to this one, and I will re-read the rest of the series before moving onto Zombie Fallout 4.

Zombie Fallout is the story of the Talbot family, and their survival through the first weeks of the zombapocalyse, when a government flu vaccination program goes catastrophically wrong. Mike and Tracy Talbot gather together their children and join other survivors in their housing estate, Little Turtle to try and evade the zombie hordes.

Written in the first person POV of Mike Talbot in journal-style, there are also third person entries from other main characters such as Mike's wife Tracy and daughter Nicole, and his sons Travis and Justin.

Mike Talbot is a fantastic main character, an ex-Marine/Human Resources Executive/Road Worker and survivalist with a die-hard dedication to his family and friends and a wickedly sarcastic sense of humor - he could have been the ultimate zombie book clich, but is definitely not. The other main characters and supporting characters are well-developed and their interactions are believable and a great mix of laughs, tension and emotion. The bad guys are ultra-creepy and the good guys are imperfect in a way that made me like them all the more.

Zombie Fallout has a perfect mix of tension-building and action, with a great big wallop of snarky, sarcastic, humor - exactly the kind of book I love - great characters and dialogue, good writing and a pee-your-pants-scary Zombie Queen thrown in for good measure.

It's hard to say more without giving the story away, particularly as I know how it progresses through the next two books, but Zombie Fallout remains exactly what it was the first time I read it - one of my favourite Zombie books/series and one of my most highly recommended books to both zombie enthusiasts and readers who are looking for their first `proper' zombie book.",4,"[-3.000903080227004, -1.7680474753023132, -1.2974897240676335, -0.992527762493182, -1.014685884873696]",-0.992527762493182

First Impression: Well-written, with a modern-age heroine romance readers can empathize and root for.

Jessica Jameson, a.k.a. Jessie James, is the outlaw of the publishing world. She has a number one New York Times bestselling book out right now, but behind the scenes, she's forced to spend time with her ex-one night stand, Grayson Reynolds, who also happens to be the new CEO of her current publishing house.  But Grayson wants to sell the romance division to another publishing company and he needs Jessie to agree to sign with the new company, not an easy feat given the animosity she holds for him.

Tamed by the Outlaw was a really fun read. I enjoyed the characters and loved returning to the Vegas romance convention setting. It's such a great series. Each story I've read in this continuity has been such an enjoyable read, and this one is no different. I loved the author's writing style, and how quickly she pulled me into the story and into Jessie's world. Into Jessie's problems.

I especially loved the dynamic between Jessie and Grayson. It's obvious from the second they are together on the page that they have some serious unfinished business between them, and lots of good old-fashioned, sparks-flying, chemistry. I loved that while they shared one night together, in which she had no idea who he really was, they've since switched to a sort of boss/employ, enemies to lovers dynamic. Which is one of my all time favorite themes to read.

Grayson Reynolds is a smart, crafty hero, but since he's working with the wrong mindset, his craftiness gets him into trouble. As does Jessie's. This was something I really loved about this book. Both characters were working with the wrong impression of each other, and sometimes the right impression with the wrong reasoning, and it made their decisions, based more in emotion than sound business sense, that much more troublesome for them. Which in turn made the book that much more fun and enjoyable for me as reader.

If you love a good enemies to lovers, boss/employee, forbidden love romance story, Tamed by the Outlaw by Michelle Sharp is a book I'd recommend reading. It's a fast-paced, well-written romance novella and a great addition to Entangled's What Happens in Vegas continuity series.",4,"[-2.7814835350020277, -1.682506637511727, -1.0420393378566521, -0.992784071081494, -1.315179744118374]",-0.992784071081494
653,"It's always a pleasure when an author produces a seamless blend of two favorite genres, as debut novelist Kieran Shields has done in The Truth of All Things. Set in Portland, Maine during the 1890s, the book opens with the grisly, ritualistic murder of a young prostitute. Deputy Marshal Archie Lean catches the case, and the coroner has called in a specialist in interpreting evidence, one Percival Grey. The duo must carve out an efficient working relationship, and as that happens, they begin to note ties to the victims of the Salem witch trials. More murders ensue, and Lean and Grey frantically, though methodically, track down the killer, who leads them through enough twists and turns that the denouement is difficult to foresee.

What quickly comes to mind while reading Truth is the relationship between Sherlock Holmes and Inspector Lestrade, though Lean is a better detective than Lestrade. Grey, however, might have read the Holmes canon, as he shares many of the same professional traits, including his reticence, his brilliance, and his penchant for donning masterly disguises. This would be annoying if Shields had handled it poorly, but it's a pleasure to note the similarities while getting to know Grey as his own character. A third character, single mother and librarian Helen Prescott, plays an important role in helping to pinpoint the motive behind the mayhem. Period detail abounds, in which the temperance movement and racial prejudice (Grey is one half Abenaki) loom large.

The Truth of All Things is an outstanding novel, even if it is Shields's first. Here's hoping there will be many more to come.",4,"[-4.22307799733191, -1.2653359401794013, -1.0669058005072167, -0.9927877262996307, -1.2696541000487827]",-0.9927877262996307

68,"The Keeper by Luke Delaney is an eery and disturbing tale. After spending his childhood in a residential home where he was abandoned and abused, Thomas Keller, now a sexual predator, is on the loose, full of anger and rage. As a London mailman, he is mostly anonymous, and so is able to kidnap women from their homes and steal personal items.

The police have no idea when, or how, this psycopath does his foul deeds, or that he keeps his victims in steel cages in his cellar in the country. I know this part is not an entirely  original storyline, but hey. The women all look very similar, the reason being that the abductor snatches those who remind him of a long-ago friend who was nice to him, called ""Sam"" which is short for Samantha.

The story is quite disturbing and dark in places. The women are mostly unclothed and are subject to torture with a stun gun and caqttle prod. They are not well cared for and are given little to eat or drink all the while being subjected to Keller's advances. Then when he becomes displeased or tired of one of his captives he disposes of them.

The characters are well defined - the police inspector who tries to get into the mind of the killer; and the madman hoping to find the ""real"" Sam again to make him whole again, are both well written.

The story illuminates the sufferings of thiose who have been dem,eaned and persecuted since childhood. All in all the book was a bit long and  the quality of the storyline varied from ""eh"" to ""interesting.""

1873,"This is a great follow-up to City of Bones.  Here Jace is just as moody as the first book.  Times you love him, times you hate him.  Magnus is back in the book as well and much more likable than the first book.  Valentine is still up to no good; Clary is still torn between Simon and Jace.  Simon has an interesting turn of fate in this book by becoming a vampire.  There are some close calls when Clary thinks she's lost Simon.  Also this love/attraction between Jace and Clary ventures on the lines of being sick; they are brother and sister after all.  But are they?  This question is neatly hidden in the book and I'm eager to find out how much they are alike and just what the Inquisitor was going to tell Jace before her demise.  A new character is introduced in this book as well, a young werewolf Miaia.  Will something develop between Simon and Miaia?  Alec will also come very close to admitting to his parents his romance with Magnus.  This is kind of strange, not in the fact that they are both guys, but in the fact that Magnus is so much older than Alec.  However, it's nice to not see him mooning so badly over Jace in this book.

This was good book and I did like it better than the first.  Its action packed from start to end.

Leslie was always the youngest and brightest in the room. Entering college three years ahead and graduating with a PHD. She was ready to start her life with some adventure. Taking a job with her cousin put her in the path of Magnus a billionaire who was ensnared with Leslie right from the beginning. The problem is neither had relationship skills and they both have insecurity when it comes to the opposite sex. Now all they have to do is find a way around that great divide.
 Erik and Misha have so much in common. Erik a product of foster homes, Mish a product of a dysfunctional family. Their meeting at her friends Lacey's home just stirred the pot of kindred emotions. Once the two started seeing each other, it just became a forgone conclusion that they were meant to be in spite of the pitfalls that they endured to get there. This book is filled with betrayal, hilarious antidotes, and second chances to get love done right. It was an awesome read.

I was more than a little troubled, however, by the self-serving actions of several senior officers and elected officials.

This is the fourth zombie movie from George A. Romero, creater of ""Night of the Living Dead"".  Those with a fondness for zombie movies will not be disappointed, although I found it inferior to last year's ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake.

227,"In this moving true story of Madeleine Albright's past as a child growing up in Europe, readers get to experience her discoveries of her history through her words, many of them a shock to her, especially with her Jewish heritage.  In a way, Prague Winter is a voyage of discovery and with Albright's clear and honest writing style, readers are swept away by her prose.

This is the harsh story of a world that now seems unfamiliar to us, when a rising Germany controlled by a vicious dictator saw the fate of human existence in black and white, where only the white were allowed to survive in Hitler's mind.  As a child growing up in what was then Czechoslovakia, it is a heart-wrenching story in some ways, as Albright tells it with skill and drama, mounting the tension that was very real, as she and her family left their home country for England.  But stories continued to unfold of what was happening back in their native nation.

Albright has clearly done a lot of research for this book, not just on her own family, but on the history and sources of the period, along with many photos from that time, it presents a thorough picture of this part of Europe during World War II and the rise of the Fuhrer.  It is also an insight into the culture of the Czechs, a people who do not bow down lightly and whose patriotism and culture is everything to them.  In some ways, Prague Winter reads like a powerful history book that would make great reading for any high school or college student wanting to learn more about the period; and at the same time it is a poignant biography of these people and of this child that was shaped into the incredible woman that she was to become.

After the unexpected death of her husband, Joanne Huist Smith had no idea how she would keep herself together and be strong for her three children--especially with the holiday season approaching. But 12 days before Christmas, presents begin appearing on her doorstep with notes from their ""True Friends."" As the Smiths came together to solve the mystery of who the gifts were from, they began to thaw out from their grief and come together again as a family. This true story about the power of random acts of kindness will warm the heart, a beautiful reminder of the miracles of Christmas and the gift of family during the holiday season.

About Author:

Joanne Huist Smith is a native of Dayton, OH. She earned a bachelor's degree in English at Wright State University and worked as a reporter for the Dayton Daily News. She is the mother of three and grandmother of two.

My Review:

  Such a precious story that is perfect for the holidays. A family of five loses the father of the family and is instantly grief stricken and understandably so. Christmas seems like a desrt land in the wake of it all. But as a very generous family starts to help the grief stricken family by leaving anonymous gifts on their door step. Before long this gives the family some hope to cling to that gradually gets them through such a devastating time.

 The author has set her memories to page so that she is able to share with everyone the Secret Santa tradition. The world and those around us could really use some cheering up, especially during the holidays. What a great story and how awesome would it be to be able to provide this to a family in need.

1999,"First, I'm glad to see that this title by Heather Graham is part of a series of books (Cafferty & Quinn). The downside is that there is a lot of background done that will likely help bolster other books in the series. Still, this book can be enjoyed on its own.

Danni Cafferty and Michael Quinn are at the center of this story. She is a shop owner who just lost her father, a collector of odd things. Michael Quinn lived the fast life and loses his life, only to come back from his experience with the resolve to live a more virtuous life. Enter, the bust of an evil man from Roman times that Danni and Quinn must find to save lives. ...and that's all just in the beginning of the story.

This story is written mostly from Danni and Michael's point of view with a sharper focus on Danni's POV. The little shop she has inherited has some odd items, many neutralized by Danni's father Angus. There is paranormal material in the book, enough to satisfy the those of us who enjoy a bit of the paranormal. There is a romance that brews between Danni and Quinn, enough the satisfy those who like some romance, but don't want it to be the center of their reading. Though it did take some time to take off, this is a good thriller that keeps you guessing.",3,"[-2.544717219183746, -1.747485003953673, -1.2269186003510262, -0.9958853331773428, -1.3015513200262738]",-0.9958853331773428

Leah and Sam each had their issues which created a rocky start. Sam was a good guy at heart, but he really had a knack for sticking his foot in his mouth by saying things that could be taken the wrong way... unfortunately too many times Leah, being a bit insecure about her size, did just that. These two were crazy attracted to each other, and thanks to Sam telling her Mother they were engaged, they  had plenty of time to spend together and realize what sizzling chemistry there was between them. In some ways Sam was all over the place trying to figure out his true feelings, but that was what made him seem more real to me. I mean who among us, male or female, wouldn't have cold feet after getting away from an ex who was just a bit crazy?  And being a big curvy woman myself, I could totally relate to Leah and her struggle to see herself as sexy. Don't get me started on her mother. I loved the feisty side of Leah and cheered how she stood up for herself when she'd had enough.

This book is well written with a great theme, some deliciously sexy scenes, great characters, a steady pace and a fabulous ending! 4.5 stars

The fun comes in with the two male romantic interests for Georgina: Roman and Seth.  I loved reading about how awkward Seth was and how Roman and Georgina hit it off, but she had to keep pushing him away.  The mystery was entertaining, I couldn't have solved it myself, but the main character understood it pretty quickly. There was still a surprise and a twist or two, which made the mystery really well thought out.  I enjoyed every character in this book, and couldn't stop reading.  I loved reading about Georgina's past, when she first became a succubus, it added a level of humanity to a creature which isn't supposed to be pleasant and friendly.  The characters weren't too sarcastic or tough, everything fit wonderfully.

Jameson is a born wolf and a strong member of the Feral Breed MC. A year earlier he found his mate lying among the dead bodies at a massacre and has dreamed of her and grieved her loss ever since.
Aoife is an archer, necromancer and deadtalker who helps spirits transition into the afterlife. Overcome by the sheer number of new spirits, she was in a trance between worlds when Jameson found her and thought she was dead. She has dreamed of him every night since then, believing him to be a fantasy.  But when she and Percy, a childhood friend and foreteller, travel to a lighthouse near Merriweather Fields to help witches under attack, she sees a man she thought existed only in her mind. Guided by Percy, her arrows bring down wolves attacking a coven and a man distracted when he sees her, his shock evident.
Jameson is confused and temporarily immobilized when he sees the woman he believed dead, opening him to an attack by the enemy.  But when he falls, she comes to his defense, felling wolves with arrows that shouldn't be able to permanently stop them, but do.
After the battle ends, it isn't over, though, because the nearby  Merriweather Fields is under siege and Blaze has been challenged by a shifter named King for the presidency of the NALB.

Tip runs away, with his creation Jack Pumpkinhead, to explore the lands of Oz, and make his way to the Emerald City to meet the Scarecrow, now crowned King.  Many adventures ensue, and at the end, Tip learns a surprising fact about his background.

I have long since been a fan of the Oz stories, and things Oz related.  While I loved the old MGM movie, the books go so much deeper into the mythology of the Land of Oz.  In fact, fans of the movie would hardly recognize this book as the same setting for Judy Garland's skipping and singing.

Baum created a magic and wonder that few others have been able to capture.  In this book, we see some of his previous characters, such as the Scarecrow and Tin Man, but we meet a new protagonist in Tip, and he brings new life to Oz.

One thing I did find quite interesting in the book was the theme on gender.  First we have girl rebel soldiers taking over the Emerald City, and forcing the men to do the women's work.  The we have a boy who turns out to be a girl, who has been magically transformed.  Both examples are relevant to the way gender is handled today.

2789,"Note: This was provided by Sourcebooks Casablanca in exchange for an honest review.

Brave the Heat is a second chance romance but calling it that isn't giving the book justice because it's so much more. There's a mystery suspense angle to it because of a serial arsonist, the first of its kind, in the town of Old Brookfield and with Gavin being the fire chief, catching the perpetrator before he starts even a worse fire is vital. I had three potential suspects, one lingering closer to the top of that list than the other two, and when the identity was revealed, it was the motive for the crimes that proved to be heartrending.

Gavin and Jordan's love story was anything but simple, what with both of them having to deal with what happened fifteen years ago, and then you add to that their own personal issues and it's obvious that a happily-ever-after will have to be hard fought. I loved the resilience that these two had, refusing to totally give up on the possibility of having the kind of life that mistakes they made robbed them of for so long. Aside from their devotion to each other, love for their families and friends comes into play in this story.

There were a couple of times that I couldn't help but shed a few tears, having been overcome by two events in the story, one that you see coming but playing out beautifully and the other leaving me stunned and equally as heartbroken as the characters in the book. This first book has set the bar extremely high for the rest of the series, but I wouldn't be surprised if my expectations were met and even superseded with each new addition.

It has a mild pleasant taste that does not overwhelm any sauce, cooks to al dente when one follows the directions, and is made from whole grains that add fiber to ones diet.

Barilla makes several kinds of pastas and I have to admit, I like every one of them.  I use the veggies in one recipe with chicken, and the protein plus in some others.  I like the whole grain pasta best for my spaghetti, but have now tried it in other pasta shapes in other Italian dishes and it has exceeded my expectations.

Shes still struggling with the guilt by association label many people want branded on her thanks to her beloved but dearly departed husbands criminal business practices. Ironically, Cam is the one who ultimately has to start putting up walls of her own when she realizes she has fallen for this reluctant to commit hero.

No, Cal was certainly not perfect. His reaction to a big reveal caused him to have a shouldnt have said that moment that is pretty hard to forgive and forget. The plus side is it leads to a groveling hero who realizes he cant live without his girl.

Cam did truly love her husband, folks, and he reciprocated those feelings. Shes had three years to deal with the aftermath of his death and shock over what happened. There is a clever twist where he contacts Cam from beyond the grave, and it helps give her some very painful but necessary closure.

With writing that flows, a sweet/sassy/feisty resilient heroine that keeps the hero on his toes, I hated to see this book end. Heres to hoping book 2, Sledgehammer, will be as equally entertaining. I'm assuming it will feature Cam's equally feisty roommate.

Dangelico, Pages: 271, stand-alone but part of a series, no cheating, no love triangle, no OW/OM drama, reluctant to commit football hero who is not a manho, slow burn, sassy heroine, shouldnt have said that moment, groveling hero, celibate hero and heroine.

I like the warm light, much warmer than your typical LED. I have a long hallway with 6 fixtures, and we just started transitioning from some warmer soft white CFLs to LEDs, and this color matches exactly, vs. some other allegedly soft white LEDs, which are closer to the blue daylight/work light bulbs.

But these bulbs are so attractive, they seem like a waste in my milk glass fixtures. I'm redoing a new place, and I'll definitely go with open fixtures and choose these pretty bulbs.

4763,"It is a half-century after the Earth is in ruins from an alien invasion. Only a handful of humans remain, trying to stay alive and communicate with their counterparts on the one remaining hidden spaceship. The aliens have shields that have never been penetrated, unknown origins or motivations. Now they have decided to methodically exterminate the last few humans from Earth.

But its not over until its over. Luck and an accidental discovery allow the humans one last desperate attempt to fight back. Now, a daring attempt from an ace pilot and a few brave resistance fighters on Earth are all that stand between total extinction and taking back humanitys home.

This action based Sci-Fi thriller is full of ordinary heroes against overwhelming odds. Little is told about the aliens until late in the novel. It gives the listener the feeling of desperation that the survivors would feel. What possible hope could they have, after all? And it is very effective. The characters are believable and we easily empathize with them. It is also interesting that two generations have gone by since the invasion with few living witnesses to the original apocalypse. Many survivors simply want to hide and live as best they can in the ruins. Only when that option is removed do they have to join in the fight.

Jeff Hays provides an exceptional performance, exuding the overwhelming foreboding and desperation in his voice that the characters would feel. His accents and characterizations are excellent and the listener is swept up in the story. It would be difficult to imagine a better match for the novel.

Alien invasion, desperate humans, star-ships, cool weapons, exciting fight scenes and flawed heroes all combine into an extremely entertaining novel. It is clearly the first in a series of unknown length and will have the listener looking forward to the sequels. Highly recommended.

904,"The Lincoln Myth has a great ending, very well done. I liked the book as an adventure/mystery though I found a bit too much preparation for the ending. A large part of this book is about the Mormon religion and the connection with the constitution and A. Lincoln. Though it has a lot of factual information included, which made it very interesting to me, I got a bit bogged down in some of the details. At the end of the book the author indicates what was invented by him and what was factual, which I feel, is an excellent thing to do.
The book is about the idea of a state or states having the right to secede from the union. A group of Saints decide that this is their right from information they discovered which came from the writers of the constitution. The plot revolves around this Mormon group, the U.S. President and those working for the federal government who are trying to stop this effort. The ideas seem very timely and the possibility of secession seem very real. This was the greatest strength in this book.

They live in a tiny Manhattan apartment, refusing help from Julian's wealthy parents, but are deeply in love and very happy. Then Julian makes an album and is taken on by Sony. No one expects the album to do much, but to everyone's surprise it takes off, becoming a best-seller and a tremendous hit almost overnight. Julian is suddenly besieged by offers to make personal appearances, go on tour, be interviewed, and hit on by groupies, and soon the scandal sheets take over. They publish lurid stories of Julian and Brooke, as well as of Julian and other women, and print what looks like revealing photos to prove it.

Understandably Brooke is crushed and bewildered, even though she knows in her heart that the things written about her beloved husband are lies, still she has no defense. She loses her jobs because of the bad publicity and is constantly hounded by the paparazzi. The couple become a living symbol of the old adage, ""Be careful what you wish for--it might come true.""

3808,"4.25 stars-- POCKETFUL OF SAND is the latest romantic, contemporary, adult storyline from author M. Leighton. This is former pro football star Cole Danzer and single mother Eden Taylors storyline.

Told from alternating first person points of view (Eden and Cole) the focus of the storyline is the building relationship between two people who believe they are broken beyond repair. Both with painful, heartbreaking backstories that have all but destroyed each of their lives, our hero and heroine have struggled with haunting memories, grief and guilt.

Eden and her daughter Emmy are new to Millers Pond-a shy, quiet seaside town of 2000 inhabitants. On the run, Eden is determined to keep Emmy safe and protected. Meeting Cole Danzer was never in the cards but Eden is drawn to the reclusive, former football player whose heart and soul are shattered by the past. Cole wants nothing to do with relationships or love but meeting Eden gives Cole a hope for the future.

The secondary and supporting characters include some of the people from Millers Pond including brother and sister duo Jordan and Jason Bailey as well as a few regulars at the local restaurant and caf.

We are privy to Eden and Coles histories through reflection and memory-each relating their experiences and nightmares about the past and the present. Eden is determined to keep Emmy safe while Cole is determined never again to lose his heart.

M. Leighton pulls the reader into an intense, emotional and heartbreaking story where the trauma of the past continues to haunt the present. POCKETFUL OF SAND is captivating, compelling and seductive; the hero and heroine are passionate, broken and tragic. When fated lovers meet, anything is possible to overcome, including that which we believe is insurmountable and lost.",3,"[-3.3563755033004146, -1.6121995729796643, -1.0397102963642908, -0.9984772642665855, -1.3492374384235972]",-0.9984772642665855

I found the book to be full of hysterical writing, loved that part actually, loved Marcus and Lily's relationship, very heartwarming, but didn't care for the 10 year age difference between Cat and Marcus. Found it kinda creepy actually. Not sure how you can turn head over heels for someone after only six years when she was 18 and throwing herself at you, just didn't set right with me. Once you get over that situation it was a good read. Dane was an obnoxious jerk, didn't care for his character at all, but you know who the future books in this series will be once you read this book. Loved Ava and Charlie, Griffin is a mystery, so it will be interesting to see how his character turns out. Great small town setting, makes you want to jump in the car and spend a few days there.

2215,"Most children don't spend the day of their twelfth birthday traveling alone on a Greyhound bus.  That's what this story is about though.  A child who is left to make his way through a very hazardous landscape with nothing but his innocence, his wits and a new adult friend.  Along that journey he meets danger from several sources, unpleasant people and situations, kind and caring people, and that friend.

The opening of this book almost broke my heart.  Thinking about Sebastien Ranes standing in his bedroom, in the dark, at 3 am, fully dressed, with his suitcases packed, hoping against hope that his mother would have changed her mind about sending him away.  Again.  This time all the way from Stockton, California to Altoona, Pennsylvania by himself on the bus while she marries the latest in her long list of boyfriends and they go on a honeymoon.  But Sebastien is already a realist because he understands his mother, he knows that she has already chosen who will stay with her and who will have to go.

On the dedication page of this book the author states that the bulk of this story is true.  What he does not reveal is precisely who it happened to.  Finding that this story was written in first person was a little bit of a surprise since this main character is so young to be relating the things that will be happening to him.  First person is sometimes an uncomfortable form of fiction for me to read.  As the story progressed I began to think that surely this must, at the end, be revealed as a reminiscence, a backward look at the events of this fateful trip.  That is not the case.  Because of that I have to say that Sebastien, as a character in a book, just did not come across to me as an 11 or  12 year old boy.  The vocabulary used in the descriptions is entirely too adult for someone that young to be using.  Especially since Sebastien admits that he has never done very well in school for a multitude of reasons.

Putting aside the style in which the novel is written, I can say that it immediately grabbed my attention, it involved me in this child's life on an emotional level, and it made me want to know what happened to him and how his journey ended.  Once I had begun, this author made me want to continue to read his book.",3,"[-3.668270474322397, -1.5682677503292641, -1.103845335284486, -0.9990080864244723, -1.0512544229537617]",-0.9990080864244723

Brian, her boyfriend, is a junkie, his brother and one of Taryn's best friends, Jace is the leader of the panthers. She's headed in the wrong direction if she stays near them. You see Taryn doesn't know who her parents are and has been in and out of foster homes her whole life, the only constant in her life was always Brian and Jace. Until now that is, she has a chance at a new life, a good life, one without the drugs, violence and the thieving. It's a chance for her to start over from scratch with a new family. The only downfall is that she will have to leave behind her two constants, her family, Brain and Jace.

Taryn begins her new life with her new family and everything is going good. She might not be popular but she never has been and she's OK with that. It's not until Tray Evans,handsome, secretive, top dog at school, shows interest in her that things get spicy...It's not always in a good way either. One thing is for sure, there is a connection between Taryn and Tray whether she wants to deny it or not... There is no denying it, you could cut the sexual tension with a knife! If you ask me I would tell you that their brokenness fits perfectly with one another.

The stuff hits the fan when her old life and new life collide...but she is also to blame for that as she can't seem to let go of that life either. For her future and for her safety she needs to, she must!

1634,"Deeply touching and most certainly one of the best books I've read so far this year, Still Alice brought me to whole new insights about Alzheimer's. Alice Howland, with her teaching position at Harvard and her PHD in cognitive Psychology, is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's at the age of 50. Apart from her husband and three children having to deal with this, most importantly, she must deal with it.

At the start of this book the reader is given a look into the still healthy mind of the main character, Alice. She is a busy, widely traveling professor with a busy social life and a passion for running.

Once the Alzheimer's symptoms begin to show, the reader is already familiar with the person and the psyche of Alice. This makes Alice's journey into the confusion of Alzheimer's just so much more gripping and poignant.

The medical detail of Alice's treatment, the tests she has to endure and even the hope given by drug testing on her brings a wonderful realism to this story. What really touched me is when Alice wished that she could have rather contracted cancer as in that case she would have a fighting chance. She sees cancer victims as heroes while Alzheimer's victims are simply insane people best locked away and forgotten by society.

For a touching and, in many ways, an eye-opening read, I recommend Still Alice as a must-read. (Ellen Fritz)",4,"[-2.6229450517663495, -1.6461560923265903, -1.4490156178919043, -0.9993544324382101, -1.0491070625547323]",-0.9993544324382101

I really enjoyed this.  This is the fourth book of Haig's I've done.  I like the similarity between Sean Drummond and Nelson DeMille's character John Cory.  It's that smartalecky wise cracking detective....except in this case, Drummond is a JAG officer.  The plot is not overly complex, and there's no real zingers, but the path that Drummond travels to get there makes it a five star for me.  The plot includes wrapping real elements of the fall of the Soviet Union into the plot so as to be seamless with what happens in the real world.  The pace is steady, but not blazing, and Haig manages to keep you hooked all the way through the book.

He is keenly observant and analytical and figures out quickly that she is smarter and knows more about football than she is letting on. She has her reasons for initially dumbing down a bit. She is really smart, witty, fiery and a football fanatic and good analyst herself.

Jackson is charming, sexy, intelligent, thoughtful, and supportive of those around him. But he does not date or do relationships. And he seems to have some deep hidden reasons why. She has her own reasons not to date in the work place. And she has her own background issues she has tried to keep hidden as well. So they really should keep each other off limits.

But mutual attraction and appreciation, flirty banter, smoldering chemistry, and a building friendship make it hard to resist. When friends turn into cuddle buddies it is only a matter of time before the temptation becomes too great. Trust is a big issue for them both. And Jackson is protective and is worried about his secret getting out and hurting her in the process. And she has her own secrets to worry about.

But can they survive it if their fragile trust is shaken as their secrets come to light?

This started out as a funny, fluffy, and flirty book then had twists, shocks, surprises, and lots of emotion. It was about football, friendship, love, sacrifice, and believing in what you deserve. Their pasts brought about conflict, drama, angst, scrutiny, and even danger. It ended up being much more than a sweet, easy love story.

I really loved both Jackson and Leila's personalities and their chemistry. They were completely likable and were multi-layered.

An Amoveo Legend Novella

The Amoveo Legend series is a paranormal romance series, and introduces the reader to 10 Amoveo `clans' of animal shapeshifters.  Undenied is a novella telling the story of how Boris Zankoff, a shapeshifter from the Tiger clan met his human mate, Lilian Cordero.

It's a quick sexy read that's fast paced and will get your pulse racing a little faster.  If you haven't read any of the series, this is a great introduction to the author's excellent writing style and to some of the characters.

2677,"Throughout the 1990s, as various terroristic threats from around the world came to the attention of the White House, at least one military advisor called for the use of drones for intelligence gathering and deployment of missiles.  Richard A. Clarke served under three administrations, and was constantly rebuffed in his efforts to get the use of drones approved.  Opportunities arose to strike known terrorists, including Bin Laden.  The White House, DOD, and CIA all opposed the use of drones--until September 12, 2001, when Predators were deployed against al Qaeda.  Within weeks, the use of drones to kill terrorist became common practice.

In Sting of the Drone, Clarke draws on his background in the military, intelligence, and government to paint a realistic picture of the use of drones, and tell the story of what might happen if the targets of drone warfare go on the offensive.  Told from the perspective of the pilots who remotely fly the drones, the bureaucratic decision makers who call the kills, and the terrorists on the receiving end of the attacks,  Sting of the Drone presents what may be the future of warfare.  Indeed it is already part of the present.

In this novel, Clarke's perspective can easily be read as fully pro-drone.  Through his characters, he points out the benefits of drone warfare, chiefly that the pilots are not in danger of being shot down.  In addition, using surveillance drones, a much clearer picture of the targets can be assembled before deciding on strike.  The drones are also more maneuverable and more cost effective, since they don't have to be designed to carry a pilot along for the ride.

Clarke's story-telling is similarly efficient, without a lot of dead weight.  The dialogue and action are crisp, moving along briskly, so that you don't want to put the book down.  At times, however, that crispness did lead to some choppiness as he shifted scenes or characters.  His descriptions of the drone program and the technology involved was very believable, and the interactions of the military, government, and intelligence communities have the feel of someone who has been there.

Sting of the Drone, while primarily a military action novel, does give a broad view of the use of drones, raising some of the ethical and technological difficulties of using drones.  Clarke informs and argues, but does so without veering of the direction of the story.  Sting of the Drone is a thrill ride of a book.

8973,"I loved this book! It was my first M/M story, by the talented Lilah Pace. It was a pleasant surprise and a reminder of why I keep taking chances with new-to-me authors.

James is the heir to the English throne and has hidden his homosexuality from almost everyone for years. But his discretion is taking its toll on his life and his only hope is a favorable evolution of the general public opinion. When he meets Ben Dahan during a trip to Kenya, his life is about to change. Ben takes his breath away. He is not impressed by royalty and despite his huge trust issues, James wants to win him over. Usually, James has no time to be himself with people he meets. Its all about the appearances. With Ben, everything is different, he is totally under his spell. But when he finds out Ben didn't tell him he is a reporter, James feels betrayed and tricked.

James is an engaging character and I felt for him. He is living a lie and is lonely. He feels he has to face his fate though, no matter the cost to him. But even if he is convinced Ben lured him into an affair to report on him, nothing is able to keep him from wanting to be with Ben.
Ben has to make a difficult choice between his profession and his loyalty to James. He is a decent person and regrets hurting James. His transfer to London finally gives him the opportunity to apologize and rekindle their relationship. They become lovers with a nice clean arrangement, but are they able to avoid pushing its boundaries?

I enjoyed this beautifully written story, that was both heartbreaking and heart mending! It felt fresh and realistic. Frankly, I could not put it down! Both characters grew as the story unfolded, their emotional connection becoming very strong. His Royal Secret is the first book in a duology. James and Bens story will conclude in the next book His Royal Favorite, and I cant wait to read it!

(2) That it makes the should-be-easy-to-remember suggestion that you replace its  three  AA batteries every time you reset the clocks and  recommends several brands--presumably ones that  should last at least that long between changes.  (3) That it provides a space on the side of the device to write in  the date, seven years from now, when the device itself needs replacing--a placement where you're most likely to notice it whenever you take it off the wall to change the batteries.

Now, if only monoxide and smoke detector makers could  find more forgiving  ways to call our attention to a shorter-than-expected battery life, or our occasional  maintenance tardiness, than sending us stumbling, bleary eyed and half awake, all over the house in the middle of the night, trying to figure out and silence whichever of our household's protective devices is not only NOT alarmed about anything, but just screaming  its decibels out that it needs a new battery.

In the meantime: 1. Read user guide re placement before picking a spot and drilling holes in the wall.  2. Figure out what this year's time change dates are for where you live and mark them on your calendar with note to replace all detector batteries. 3.

She will care for her grandfather, an important prophet and wise man in Torrani, and she will, in time, become a gifted healer, but first she must find the rare and very necessary Tymia herb to cure her grandfather's deadly cough. A trip into the mountainous country of Oden exposes her to peril and adventure, and might change the course of her life.

Exactly the right length to captivate and hold the reader's attention, this book is the perfect read to relax with. The author manages to fit a remarkable amount of world building and description into such a short novel without ever giving the impression of over-describing.

Although Solena is a bit too much of a damsel in distress kind of heroine for my personal taste, she does have a well-defined character. She also has a mind of her own and definitely gets things done in her quiet, feminine way.

Rundan, the hero of this tale, is in two minds and has to choose between his father and Solena. Although he is a soldier, he is a gentle, scholarly soul and the perfect match for someone like Solena.

5441,"As we'd expect from established mystery authors, A Dangerous Talent is a polished, page-turning novel. The heroine is a likeable young woman, Alix, who fell on hard times when her father went to prison for art forgery. Now she's the classic mystery protagonist, struggling in a new career, making friends and stumbling across potential romance.

I'd give the book just 4 stars because it doesn't have that extra edge that some mysteries have - the depth of character of the earlier Nevada Barr or the perfect pitch of Lisa Scottoline. The heroine's story was plausible, although I can't see why she'd drop out of Harvard in her senior year with the misguided goal of helping her father. I also think she could use a good business coach; it's hard to believe she doesn't know what to charge and how to set up her dealings with a client, such as collecting half her fee up front. If she's been hanging around the art world she would know some ins and outs of art consulting.

Alix's talents are almost too formidable: she can drive a Lamborghini with speed and flair, shoot a gun, detect dangerous gas by smell, sense when something is amiss with a work of art, and of course restore paintings to their fullest glory. She's also attractive and smart.

The best parts of the book were Alix's forays into the art world and the glimpses of Seattle and Santa Fe.  I loved the description of the entry to the Seattle Art Museum, which is very accurate (although I never found the cars scary - they're very high up on the ceiling and probably hollowed out).

The authors handled Alix's relationship with her father extremely well: she was clearly ambivalent while trying to maintain a connection. I liked the moment when Alix realized she understood why someone might be motivated to substitute a forgery for the real thing, although of course she isn't seriously tempted.

Although the authors follow the mystery code of allowing the heroine to get herself out of her own problems, she doesn't really solve a puzzle. We know who and why almost immediately; the suspense comes from watching the protagonist put the pieces together, partly by chance. The romance element was a little thin, adding more humor than love interest.

Bottom line: If you're looking for a well-crafted mystery for escape, this one's above average.",3,"[-2.5267923331123177, -1.4606490441150366, -1.0248403069493979, -1.0221886252266013, -1.0012173624933358]",-1.0012173624933358
1138,"Michael Crummy's quirky ""Galore"", with  sparks of brilliant writing was, unfortunately for me a considerable let down.  Landscapes and human prospects are equally bleak in a town ironically know as Paradise Deep and one more aptly named neighbor,  Gut.  Inhabitants are invariably (and soon) tiresomely quirky.  Characters like Devine's Widow, the matriarchal wiccan contrasted to a drunken and sybaritic RC Father Phelan.  Protestants v. Catholics and children like Mary Tryphena grow to marry not their heart's love but the washed ashore detritus that reeks of dead fish. Good luck...

Indeed Mary Tryphena, Judah and Absalom are the exception, being somewhat fleshed out.  People sort of float in and out without much purpose except to move the years along.  Crummy never stays with anyone very long so Judah may or not be a lucky talisman; Jabez Trim and his wife ache for children and ultimately succeed but we hardly know of their joy.  Indeed, joy and even satisfaction are noticeably absent from the lives any of these Labradorians.  Everyone just sort of drifts from crankiness to misery to shortage to bad weather-- flotsam in nature's harsh and uncompromising universe.

I don't think it necessarily bad that the author depict something so dreary and unpleasant, but I would like to know why anyone in their right mind would want to stay in such a harsh and depressing place. Habit?  Lack of imagination? Masochism?  When Absalom is banished for falling in love with his first cousin I wanted to shout ""run, Abie run, and don't look back.""  Banishment seemed like the lotto jackpot.  Unfortunately we don't know what ties these folk to such a miserable and forbidding place.  And that is a pity.

74,"Annihilation by Jeff VanderMeer has been on my radar for several years now. The acclaim and notoriety that is received immediately following publication inspired me to instantly add it to my TBR list. Then, as often happens with books on that list, I ignored it for several years. The announcement and intriguing trailer of a film adaptation of the book brought it to the forefront of my list again.

The novel immediately presents itself as an eerie mix of sci-fi thriller and character drama. A group of women explorers have set out on an expedition to Area X, a mysterious portion of land that has been enveloped by a transparent border. Everything within the confines of Area X disappeared, and the remaining ecosystem has been vastly changed ever since. The explorers, made up of a Biologist, Linguist, Psychologist, Surveyor, and Archeologist, set out on a mission that is shrouded in secrecy. They are not even allowed to reveal their names to each other.

We learn of this strange place through journal entries written by the Biologist. As the unit advances deeper and deeper into Area X, the unusual nature of the place is slowly revealed to us. There is a blaring sound that trumpets through the bizarre landscape each night. Much of the novel focuses on a tunnel that the squad comes into contact with, though oddly the Biologist is convinced it is more of a tower than tunnel. The walls are covered in a writing that seems to be alive. More mysterious, it seems as if someone or something is still in the process of writing it.

Despite the allure of the high-concept sci-fi that the novel provides, the slow pace, distant characters, and no real ending really kept me from enjoying Annihilation. The book is only a couple hundred pages long, but I could never find a comfortable rhythm while reading it. We purposefully don't know the characters names, and their backstories and motivations are revealed through small anecdotes provided by the Biologist. I found that this unknown made it difficult to grasp onto any of the characters. The hints of a really great story made what I read all the more frustrating.

The misunderstanding each had regarding the age of the other was very funny and I absolutely loved their friend (and matchmaker) Ginny. I really enjoy romances where the characters begin as friends and it grows into more (even if it happens quickly). There isn't any external conflict for this couple which is nice to read sometimes, all the conflict for them is internal. Art is a widower and feels guilt moving on with his life after his wifes death and Maddie has had some bad relationships which have left her frightened (I would have liked to see this developed a little bit more but I understand that there is only so much time to be spent in a work this short). I also liked how their faith was integrated into the story. Its not heavy handed but realistic and something that was very relatable to me.

Nevertheless, I love these kids! Yes! They were young, especially Alyssa. Jake and she grew up together and have been friends and neighbors since they were young. Their lives drifted apart somewhere along the way, Jake was busy with forming a band and becoming famous, while Alyssa was focused on her friends and her sports, volleyball. Their paths once again crossed when Summer began, and unexpectedly - chemistry sparked.

Since she was young, and they both knew Alyssa's parents would most likely not allow their daughter to get involve with him, they kept their relationship a secret. Most often, she would sneak up to his room and spend some time there. It was weird and I totally understand Alyssa's older sister why she was opposed to the two - her sister was very young, nave and doesn't have any experience with boys, while Jake who's 18 has been with girls, have done drugs and booze. How can they carry on a relationship? Will Alyssa get out of it unscathed when Jake no longer wanted her?

The dual-POV was a blessing. I always loved getting into the brains of the characters, and not second-guessing them. I liked Jake - he was a gentleman, and did not force Alyssa to do anything that she wasn't ready for. You may wonder why of all people, he fell for someone way younger. There were a lot of girls, but why Alyssa? Well, she's the only remaining NORMAL in his life. She makes him feel loved and everything about the two of them just feels real.  BUT of course, I would have preferred if he waited for her to grow up a little more.

I never expected the novel to be that long. It was more than what I expected. Nevertheless, it was amazing how the author was able to manage to compress almost ALL teenage issues into one book. And what I love more about this novel are the songs!!! It wasn't just the tunes or the melody, but the lyrics were pretty great as well!

Now, all we have to do is be patient, sit back and wait for the sequel.

Review: Hard Edit, the sequel to Black Balled, by Andrea Smith and Eva LeNoir, is absolutely fantastic! Like the first book, I listened to the audio book narrated by Joel Leslie. The characters, including Muffy and Minette, are well developed, amusing and fabulous. Joel Leslie brought them to life, gives the story the extra cherry on top to an already fabulous story.

Troy and Larson have been dating for a year now and are still living in their apartments within the same building. Troy has been secretly finishing a novel that is loosely based on his rough childhood. As a result, Troys childhood friend, who is mentioned in the book, seeks him out. This causes so much drama! Who knew that the childhood friend, Ethan, later went on to date Larson years later! Can Larson and Troy get over the jealousy that they have for the other? Can their relationship survive it?

This series is a #OneClick for all those who love a naughty MM romance!

4007,"I made a decision after finishing RECKLESS. Priscilla West is now an auto-buy author for me. I LOVED this book! I had decided that I would shy away from rock star stories  too much drama, cheating, groupies, etc. I gave this one a go because I had read Priscilla West books in the past and enjoyed them. Im so glad I did. This book is not your typical rock star story.

Jax Trenton, lead singer of The Hitchcocks is a complicated man with many demons. Riley Hewitt is a spitfire - seemingly strong and sassy, but she is actually just recovering from a very damaging past relationship. She and Jax first meet at an impromptu concert The Hitchcocks perform at a local club that Riley and her friend Jen were at for a night of fun. There was instant chemistry between Riley and Jax, but not your typical insta-love that you see in so many books. When Riley discovers that her new job assignment is to be the tour accountant for The Hitchcocks, she immediately sees complications on the horizon. She will try to maintain a professional relationship. After all, they just met and nothing happened between themnot really

The thing that set this book apart from the typical rock romance is that the relationship between Jax and Riley built slowly. I liked that. You got to know the characters, and they got to know each other.  The chemistry between Jax and Riley is potent, and unfolds with the perfect amount of tension.

There is so much in this book to love... it is a funny, witty, angst-filled romance with an ending that leaves you wanting more! I cant wait for the next book.

Lately I haven't had the pleasure of reading a paranormal novel and I have to admit that I missed the mysterious and sexy nature of the stories. Both Bella and Jack as werewolves had such appeal to their story and I loved the fact that Bella was a painter and that Jack had a thirst for her work.

As for the plot it allowed the romance between Bella and Jack to grow. At first I thought this might prove difficult since the characters are from enemy clans. I was worried that the romance might get sloppy or unreal, but Miller knew the direction that she wanted her characters to go and the sensual attraction between the duo could not be ignored. I will however state that the romance was a bit of a progress, but it was well worth the wait.

I could simply continue to praise this book but I want to include that Miller surprised me as an author.

Edie Harker comes from a long line of vampire hunters, but never expects to have to take on the role as The Harker so soon. When her sister, Meghan, is killed by a vamp, Edie is thrust into the job.

I really enjoyed this book. The initial drama during the opening scene was written so well, I could feel Edies heart pounding, hear her struggling to breathe, and smell the fear in the air. I wanted nothing more than to get out of there.

I loved how these two characters came together in a rather organic manner first as friends, to lovers, to more. Despite being YA, the angst level was not extreme. There were some great secondary characters, plenty of fresh humor that never overrode the storyline, and even some steamy moments that felt true to a young girls first time.

697,"The Columbus Affair is an interesting, but somewhat unsatisfying non-Cotton Malone thriller done in the Steve Berry style of adding a few novel twists to the myths and mysteries surrounding actual historical figures and events. In this case, Christopher Columbus, whose origins are vague has been recast as a closet Jew in search of a New Jerusalem in order to hide ancient and long missing Israeli artifacts. The modern day segment involves a disgraced journalist and his estranged daughter, a Jamaican crime boss, and a fanatical rich Jewish megalomaniac intent on recovering the artifacts and willing to take out anyone in his way.

The plot itself is a bit convoluted and devolves into an adventure escapade with clues that only our ""hero"" can decipher. With multiple players each coming at the mystery from their own limited perspective the story drags a bit. Berry attempts a tenuous connection to the Cotton Malone universe with a different Magellan billet stand-in that was largely unnecessary to drive the plot forward. As is typical with these historical treasure hunts, a long line of ""keepers"" has maintained this secret for centuries, but the actions of the last couple of keepers was inscrutable to say the least (relying on someone to make it to hundred is never a good strategy). None of the characters were even minimally endearing and the father-daughter relationship was only annoying.

Using your device, say a computer with bluetooth enabled or a phone, tablet or other device with bluetooth, simply use settings to connect and the device is ready.  You can plug this in, or use another USB plug on a stereo receiver for example to provide power.  Use the headphone jack (mini-jack) to accommodate your device and you are ready to go.

Use?:  Once set-up is accomplished, and this shouldn't be a difficult issue, I used this with IOS airplay to good result.  The connection is very good and it just works without an issue.

Likes:  Unlike other devices, this is a 'digital'[ device such that no need for an RCA plug!  I love the small size.  This device is about the size of a half-dollar and about as thick as a Oreo cookie.  It is pretty small.  I like the connection it provides.

Cons: For what it is, this provides lots of versatility.  Although bluetooth is becoming standard, using this enables those older devices to be utilized.

Overall:  This provides a lot of versatility for the money.  I think this is a good device and I really like the fact it doesn't ask for a RCA plug like some other devices I have used in the past.  Good device.",3,"[-2.0464641824702428, -2.158766453221129, -1.1851050592741703, -1.0057852187630345, -1.08233420339582]",-1.0057852187630345
4042,"Captain Maddox is just a little faster, stronger and more perceptive than those around him. So when the New Men attack and decimate a military convoy, he questions if he might be somehow related. These so-called New Men are human beings that have been genetically enhanced to better than old humans in every way. No one is sure what they want, but their superiority clearly threatens the survival of the human race.

There is an old space rumor of an ancient alien star ship with superior technology that might be humanitys only hope. Captain Maddox and a ragtag group of scientists and soldiers fight their way across the void to find the star ship and more importantly, get it back home in time.

There is a classic tone of the novel, reminiscent of the 1940s and 50s. The larger than life Captain Maddox leads the barely held-together group of criminals and misfits into certain death only to find the only possible escape at the last possible second.  The characters make the story; they are quirky, alcoholic, angry, dangerous, brilliant and unpredictable. You don't know if they are going to save the galaxy or tear each other apart. Its a fun ride that is well worth the listen.

The story is read by David Stifel. He has a unique character to his voice, dramatic and human; sometimes stumbling to pronounce a word correctly. Perhaps not as polished as many performers these days, his reading is enjoyable none-the-less. It is such a personal thing, but this listener found his voice enjoyable because of the flaws.

Lost Star Ship is the first in a series of unknown length. The story wraps up nicely, but leaves the door wide open for its sequel. This quirky and strange space adventure is a thoroughly entertaining ride. Youll want to find out what happens to Captain Maddox and his crew of misfits in the next installment.

2148,"While the narrator is third person, in this book, the perspective shifts as characters are highlighted by the story. Small towns  our world in microcosm, and we are a mean and gossipy, species, thriving on the preconceived notions of our youth as we struggle to outgrow them as we gain the wisdom of age. But often the gossip is the best of it. The abuse that human beings pile on one another and on their children behind closed doors is worse, far worse, leaving scars that don't heal easily, if at all. And children in the same family within the same walls experience horror differently. The reader is called upon to piece together that Lucy Bartons home was really like. Her sister and her brother remember the same time, the same flawed parents, but differently. And, it isn't just the family, but the world around them. It does indeed take a village to raise children, and insights into the village as well as the home are most enlightening. This is the world one sees in the writing of Elizabeth Strout, and as her characters struggle, learn and sometimes grow. It isn't light and it isn't easy to read, but the narrative carries you through the nice moments and the horrors of memories unearthed and exposed. Her writing is excellent, and her story-telling painfully honest. We can all learn so much from her characters and her writing. At the end of the book, the age old question remains: Can one ever really go home again? Does one really want to?",3,"[-3.782083678633799, -2.099544405922068, -1.029357436256797, -1.0066085435041687, -1.0262786819969294]",-1.0066085435041687

6792,"This third book in the Kill Devil Hills series might be called Pulled Under but really the whole series could easily be called Pulled In because thats what these stories dothey pull you in right from the start and keep you hooked up through the final page. And then some! Im sitting here right now ready for book 4, Adrift.  I don't even want to start another book because I want to savor these Kill Devil Hills characters a little longer.

So book 3 is about Rhett Morgan, Ellie and Noahs roommate introduced in book one, and Sydney Francesca Michaels, also introduced in the first book where readers caught a glimpse at their one night hook up that left Rhett drowning his sorrows and in a desperate hunt all over town for the girl whose name he didn't even know. Well it turns out Rhett and Sydney had more history than just that infamous night that made Rhett ready to leave his manwhore ways in the past.

In fact, Rhett and Sydneys past is actually pretty sweet and touching.  Despite Rhetts reputation, he shows a side to Sydney (and thus the readers) that makes him kind of a catch.  Im not sure the books blurb does Rhett justice at all as I came to adore him and certainly rooted for him to get his girl.

Without giving all the sweet treats of the story away, I will say the note thing was one of my favorite parts that really captured the romance.  But honestly the whole book kept me engaged and like the previous ones, I didn't want to put it down.

Sydney thinks shes using Rhett to get over her unrequited love for Ben Turner, but what she finds through the journey of the story is that Rhett offers what Ben cant.  Rhett intrigued me back in book 1, and he doesnt disappoint in his own story.  In fact, he definitely excelled my expectations.  Hes a great example of a character that is deeper than his reputation. Or as Rhett would look at it, hes offers so much than simply yellow snow.

Told via Rhett and Syds alternating first person POV, the storyline covers the timeframe of books 1 and 2. It can be read as a stand-alone although its beneficial to read the series from the beginning. These are a great group of characters whose lives are so intricately intertwined.",4,"[-3.111371611347356, -2.0159084476642293, -1.0385244355941645, -1.0067062115310244, -1.0797013996038314]",-1.0067062115310244
6864,"""The Last Reading"" was a fast paced and highly entertaining light cozy mystery.  Grace is totally believable and likable.  I also liked the ghost Pearl and her no nonsense attitude.  There were several laugh out loud funny moments.  The plot was rather original and interesting.  There wasn't a lot of character development but there was enough for me to like and root for Grace.  I'm sure more will be revealed regarding Rose, as well as, her past as the Series progresses.  We weren't told Grace's age but I got a sense that she was over 40.  The mystery itself was rather simple but there were several suspects so I was kept guessing until the bit reveal.  I was a little surprised by who it turned out to be and that's always a good thing when reading a mystery.  The author's writing style was concise and straight forward.  There wasn't any excessive dialogue or descriptions which frankly works for me in most instances b/c I bore easily.  I'm looking forward to the next novella in this delightful new Series.  If your looking for a lite, fun and interesting cozy mystery, I highly recommend this one.  This book was free when I read it but I could have paid up to 2.99 and I still would have felt that I had gotten my money's worth.  Enjoy!

UPDATE 9/13/14: After looking for more books to read in this Series, I discovered that this is NOT the first book in the ""Storage Murder Mystery Series"", the first was ""Jacob's Coins"" and consists of 5 novellas and is now offered in a box set.

5215,"Tender and honest, this contemporary romance tackles deep loss, wounded hearts and music as an instrument to understand the soul.

Both characters are musicians, one of them living in isolation due to past emotional scars that have left him distrustful and broken. Despite that, he finds solace in the optimist piano player once she breaks some of his barriers after he rescues her from the wolves.

I think this romance is interesting, sweet, but the way they blurt their secrets in big chunks of confessions or songs felt a bit rushed or forced. There are hot parts when they get intimate, those were sexy. Suddenly, a twist in the plot brings some serious danger to the characters. That was surprising. Though I can't say that I ever felt too sorry for James, he's an arrogant man who thinks too highly of himself. I didn't like how he treated a prospective singer at all. And I don't know why exactly but I didn't feel a connection to the characters :-( They seemed a bit unreal to me.

The story is entertaining, of course. Secrets, surprises, betrayal, and the love of music all over the place. Even though the writing didn't move me, I think the story is original, hot and has many twists.

5790,"I was pleasantly surprised by this book and found it to be a very unique beautiful read. This is the first book I have read by Nicole Edwards and as an inspiring author, I loved getting a taste of the journey an author goes through when writing a book. The only downfall for me was that the book was a little on the long side and I would have loved to have seen more interaction and development between the two main characters. Loved how the author tried to shake things up by trying something different, but between getting front row seats with the process, struggles, and development Jake went through when writing his book on top of the main storyline between Jake and Presley, I think the former overshadowed the latter a little too much.
Overall, this was a very interesting sweet read with very little angst that I found very enjoyable.",3,"[-3.0007959370432236, -1.0780104509162614, -1.1412880662194835, -1.0129553983367074, -1.1551717314255445]",-1.0129553983367074

2956,"In the opening pages of 100 Sideways Miles by Andrew Smith, I wondered if I should actually be reading it. I felt like one of those ""uncool"" teachers and administrators at Burnt Mill Creek High School challenges the teenagers to clean up their language. Maybe I'm just an old ""fuddy duddy"" and should avoid YA books.

However, I kept reading. The endearing character of Finn Easton, an epileptic boy who is trying to escape the pages of his father's popular and controversial novel, captured my heart. I was sucked into the drama and unique humor as Finn tries to figure out his place in this world along with his hilarious and crass best friend Cade and the beautiful, thoughtful and kind Julia.

Finn looks at life in such a refreshing and singular way. He's charming and self-deprecating and occasionally bewildered. Smith expertly captures the confused teen and makes him likable and vulnerable while also being smart and occasionally wise. Smith also does well at creating tension and even romance. The birthday scene between Finn and Julia may be one of my favorite scenes from the few young adult novels I have read.

In short, the novel is brilliant, entertaining and inspiring.",3,"[-3.1158692874668747, -1.2096902157570835, -1.2490736009970516, -1.0133561516675103, -1.0404541164297898]",-1.0133561516675103
1932,"The second novel in Beverly Lewis' Seasons of Grace series, it picks up almost immediately where The Secret leaves off. I enjoyed this one a lot more than I did the first one.

Grace Byler's mother has been missing for several weeks and as the family tries to continue with their lives, they wonder at her reasons for leaving and hope for her return. As Grace begins to piece together the few clues she has about why her mother left, she simply finds more questions. When the young man she thought liked her best friend Becky, suddenly transfers his interest to her, she's reluctant to accept his advances. Taking care of her family and wishing to search for her mother are her most important priorities.

Her friendship with Heather, the young Englisher deepens and the two young women are able to help each other.  Heather finally tells her father about her illness and he, understandably, wants her to take the traditional course of treatment, not an alternative one.

As Lettie searches for her own answers, away from her family, her husband Judah searches for his own at home.  He suspects that his in-laws have the answers, but they aren't forthcoming.

This is a compelling story. The characters are well-developed and easy to care about. It is also, obviously, a link in the trilogy. Nothing is really resolved and more questions arise than are answered. Little clues are planted that hint at the discoveries to come. I think I have things figured out, but await the next book for confirmation!

An easy, enjoyable read. I read it in an afternoon.",3,"[-3.3004225273289967, -1.7357778008609415, -1.0139086816280807, -1.013423466965757, -1.206183965567535]",-1.013423466965757

330,"I'm going to make this short, I loved this story! Ideally, I normally prefer romance stories to be full-length novels rather than novellas, yet there was much left to be desired about this story.

To begin with Boyle outshined fellow authors in the industry as she always delivers in both romance in plot. The thing I love most about the author is the bold fact that I never feel like I'm reading the same book twice and in today's industry I think it is difficult to find such an author. So I'm thrilled whenever I get the chance to review a Boyle novel.

Highlighting the romance in a further step I greatly loved the story of Major Kingsley and Arabella. Their story was the ideal romance for me. Kingsley himself was very masculine which might seem odd to mention when discussing romance, but I find that many heroes in novels are often missing their more manly-like qualities. I tend to favor a tough, alpha hero is capable of sweeping the heroine off her feet.

As for Arabella I liked her character equally as well. At first I wondered if she would be worthy of a man like the Major, but then I soon realized that such a match was meant to be and this is one courtship/marriage that I did enjoy and has quickly became a favorite of mine.

521,"Another amazing chapter in the quest for the tower, A long book I was struggling to find time to read this but couldn't wait till I could pick it up again. This book came with me everyday to work in the event I found a few minutes of down time so I could read even a few pages more.

The beginning of this book picks up right were the previous left off. In Wastelands we are left with quite a cliffhanger and I was so glad to already have Wizard and Glass so I didn't have to wait. From the first page I was thrust into the action and adventure with no chance to catch my breath. It was a great start.

After the resolution of the cliffhanger from Wastelands, King decided to take the reader on a journey into Roland's past. We get to see the fourteen year old boy who has just earned his guns and has been sent off on a mission by his father. The Youngest Gunslinger brings two of his friends witch have not quite finished their training or test of man hood, they are still apprentice gunslingers. As exciting as it seemed to finally understand why Roland is the way he is, I found myself bored at first.

This tale of Roland's boyhood took a little while to get going but looking back, it seemed absolutely necessary. It helped to get a feel of how the world was back when. Once the story introduced the players the fun really began. I found myself loving these new characters just as much as those King left behind to hear the story told by Roland. It was an amazing pager turner once it gathered momentum and I couldn't put this down; when I had free time of course. So far I have not been disappointed with a single book in the Dark Tower Series.",4,"[-1.856048252202052, -1.3246270484202283, -1.017774814003678, -1.0138318414735454, -1.148648403918185]",-1.0138318414735454

After a recording hiatus of two years, and Rick Wakeman returning to the band, we're treated to an album with a slightly more straightforward approach, with tracks such as PARALLELS and the title track being more rockish than usual. The last three tracks are vintage progressive Yes, with beautiful melodies and sophisticated arrangements taking center stage; I really enjoy TURN OF THE CENTURY, with its haunting guitars and vocals. WONDEROUS STORIES has a similar structure as well. The last track (AWAKEN) features great work by Wakeman, and is a favorite among the band members as an all-around masterpiece. I recommend this album for everyone getting into Yes, but not the place to start your collection. Instead, try The Yes Album, Close To the Edge, or Fragile as a starting point.

Keeping her head down and working at a boring job whilst she completed her thesis for her PhD at night, Mia had no intention of getting involved with a superior, let alone the big boss.  However, there is no accounting for physical attraction, and Mia is the first woman that Raphael meets that the more time he spends with her, the more he wants to be with her. Mia's foolish past catches up with her and at the same time she realises that she is pregnant.  There is only one thing to do, and that is to go into hiding. Although the story was a little disjointed at times and skipped from one scene to another, it was well written with an interesting plot with complex characters. Mia's family were charming and their unconditional love when things got ugly, was amazing. Raphael's lack of family closeness is sad and it is only when he is with Mia that he realises that she completes him. I enjoyed this book and although it is steamy, it is also tender and romantic.

It is Bashir's home which Dalia's family moves into.  Bashir meets Dalia when he returns to visit his home.  This is their story and as one can easily imagine it is not an altogether happy one, but leaves a small kernel for optimism.

I was impressed with Tolan's insight into the situation in Israel and Palestine.  He provided a historical context for it in a way which I felt was fair and outline mistakes and inflexibility of both sides.  He also put it in a very real context following two decent people and a house through their lives and their struggles.

While I thought that it was a fair representation of the situation as it exists, I am sure there are those on both sides  which feel it is biased and of course that represents the intractability which exists.

From the back cover: Its just businessbut its about to get personal for hard-nosed lawyer David Friedman when the housing crash of 2008 derails his shot at partnership with Southwest Floridas most prestigious law firm. Given a year to prove he can make rain during Floridas economic drought, David rolls up his sleeves and lands the client of his dreamsFrank OReilly, a real estate developer embroiled in dozens of lawsuits and hell-bent on turning a profit during the recession. Little does David know that Franks company is involved in a murderous plot to cover up years of mortgage fraud in the Sunshine State.

As David prepares for a trial that will make or break his career, he discovers that a secret investor in Franks company is responsible for murder and will continue killing to hide the truth. The only thing David cant figure out is whether Frank is the conspiracys victim or its mastermind. To answer that question, David must risk far more than partnership as he unravels one dark secret after another about his client, his law firm, and, ultimately, himself.

Attorney David Friedman is not Perry Mason. David was looking to make partner in the firm he works for but he was passed over. Now, if he works miracles, he will be looked at in another year. So David turns to other work and finds real estate developer Frank OReilly. This is the time of the housing crash so things are not well with OReilly. As things progress David goes to court but OReilly may be involved in murder or there is someone else working for him that is. Mr. Thames has provided us with a highly complicated plot. David is a highly interesting character and you have to make a decision if he himself is a good or bad guy or both. Foreclosure is loaded with twists and turns that will leave you guessing all the while you are flipping pages to find out what happens next. Mr. Thames has provided us with a fairly exciting book and well worth the read.

464,"A young acting student runs screaming and naked onto a narrow LA canyon road and nearly startles an elderly driver off the edge onto the rocks below. Michaela Brand and a male classmate, Dylan Meserve, tell a harrowing, headline-grabbing story of carjacking and sadism. More sensational headlines ensue, however, when the story proves false.

Michaela blames emotional problems and her co-conspirator, who convinced her the hoax would impress their eccentric teacher.  The state, pressing charges, calls in psychologist Alex Delaware. The charges fizzle, but Alex's insights are called for when Michaela turns up murdered and Dylan disappears.

In his 20th appearance, narrator Delaware teams up again with longtime friend, police detective Milo Sturgis. Their investigation centers on the Playhouse where Michaela and Dylan studied. Run by wealthy Nora Dowd who never succeeded in an acting career of her own, the Playhouse offers free and freeform classes for young hopefuls with no money. Dylan was a particular teacher's pet, though Nora's real-estate mogul brother claims the relationship was over.

The Dowd family and its employees offer up several suspects as at least one old murder turns up ties to the Playhouse. Secretive rich people and twisted, murky motives provide a fairly compelling read, but the repetitive rehashing between Milo and Alex has long grown old, as has Alex's difficulties with women. And the LA minutiae of description in every one of Alex and Milo's comings and goings - right down to the volume of traffic on various streets - lends way more atmosphere than we need. Ditto for the stereotypical descriptions of air headed, plastic would-be actors. Readable, but fans of Kellerman's writing skills may wish he'd come up with something new.

Having worked with young people in foster care, I found Victoria to be absolutely authentic.  In my work, I often found young people who started to do well and succeed and then would do something to throw everything out of whack yet again.  I came to feel that most of these young people were far more comfortable with failure than with success and when they would start to do well, it became very scarey for them.

The listing of the meaning of flowers in the back of the book is something that I will keep and refer to often.  So interesting!

This is a book that will keep you up late at night as you see what happens when Victoria turns 18 and is no longer in the foster care system.  While it seems difficult to believe that at 18 she would no longer be supported, it is true.  I know of one foster youth who was dropped off at a homeless shelter on the day she turned 18.

257,"A book featuring Egyptian and Greek gods is bound to jump the cue to the top of my reading list and The Chaos of Stars was no exception. The day when Isadora, daughter of two immortal Egyptian gods, realized that she wouldn't inherit her parents' immortality, was a pivotal point in her life. How could she form lasting relationships and commit herself to a romantic interest if she wasn't going to live forever?

The captivating beginning of this book ensnared me so thoroughly that I read through The Chaos of Stars in one day. If the start of the story was excellent, the rest of the book certainly didn't disappoint. There is a highly interesting, well-researched bit of history of the Egyptian gods in the beginning of each chapter.

Isadoras dreams and visions of past events turning into darkness serves to crank up the suspense. Although Isadora is rebellious where anything to do with her mother, Isis, is concerned, she is by no means vindictive.

She has a deep desire to make friends, form permanent relationships and follow that tantalizing romantic possibility called Ry. Unfortunately, the knowledge that, unlike several of her siblings, she isn't immortal, keeps her from making a commitment. Geeky, stunningly good looking Ry, however, isn't about to let her slip through his fingers.

Although this book is a tale filled with action, suspense and a healthy dose of humor, it also looks deeply at some profound questions about life, living and mortality.

The Chaos of Stars is a thrilling, suspenseful tale of tasteful romance, with a whole lot of wisdom and an ever present touch of humor. If the ancient gods and their confusing, often dysfunctional families, interest you, this book should be a must-read.

281,"Set in the mid nineteenth century during the California gold-rush, Walk on Earth a Stranger is a captivating and often touching read. After her parents' brutal murder, Leah Westfall is forced to leave her hometown of Dahlonega, Georgia, to escape her uncle, Hiram. Hoping to meet up with her longtime friend, Jefferson McCauly, she heads west with thousands of gold seekers and pioneers with only her horse, Peony, for company.

A true page-turner, Walk on Earth a Stranger is definitely among my favorite five books for this year. This book gripped me from the very first page where it is revealed that the main character, Lee, has an unusual supernatural gift. From there on I simply immersed myself in the adventures of Leah, her horse, and her best friend, Jefferson.

The characters in this book are realistic, endearing and definitely the kind of people one wants to continue reading about. Leah is tough and gutsy, yet, deep down she is still the lady her mother wanted her to be.

Jefferson is a bit more of an enigma. With his Native American heritage, he is often bitter about other people's attitudes regarding his ethnicity. He and Leah make a wonderful team when they are working for the Joiner family. Together, and knowing each other's ways, they perform several rescues during the hard journey to California.

What struck me was the staggering amount of research the author must have put into this book. Vivid descriptions of life in a travelling wagon train put me right there with the families as they journeyed across prairie, desert and mountains. Romance is only hinted at throughout most of this story.

For a stimulating, gripping and deeply touching read, I recommend Walk on Earth a Stranger as an absolute must-read. (Ellen Fritz)",4,"[-3.198296235345294, -1.9534992993428948, -1.140883498892023, -1.0290510121029302, -1.2456820812002287]",-1.0290510121029302

2274,"Parallax View: ""The apparent displacement of an object caused by a change in the position from which it is viewed"".

Who can you trust?? To me this is part of what this book is about, as in the story the protagonist, Tracie Tanner finds herself in this tenuous situation. She is only supposed to deliver a letter from Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to the U.S President Ronald Reagan, but what occurs along the way is very frightening. Why would Gorbachev be sending a letter that no one knows the content besides him. Tracie is ordered not to open the letter under any circumstance and as a CIA agent she does what she is assigned to do and protects that letter with her life.

The other part of the book to me is loyalty.
Loyalty
""Faithfulness or devotion to some person, cause or nation.""

Tracie is rescued by a young, air traffic controller, Shane Rowley. He pulls her out of the plane that crashed suspiciously as she was on her way to deliver the letter. Unbeknownst to Shane, he will be on the ride of his life. These two people are both very loyal to their country so they will do whatever it takes to see that the letter reaches President Reagan.

Parallax View takes the reader on the ride of your life. I was around of course in 1987 so I remember the Cold War mostly from movies and books. This finely researched and written fictional account of the CIA, KGB and higher up government officials in the year 1987 make for a fast paced page thriller that I could not put down. I love Mr. Leverone's style of writing as the story does not lag but keeps the reader wanting more. I can almost see a sequel to this story...

7894,"I've never even used a Dyson vacuum before, but I've heard lots of great things.  The Dyson Cinetic Big Ball Animal Vacuum is impressive!  It's easy to assemble - although the Tangle-free Turbine tool doesn't have a storage place on the main unit so it must be stored separately.  From the first use, the suction is impressive.  I can actually see individual carpet fibers instead of the flat mass that my carpets normally look like.  It picks up dirt and hair like nobody's business!  Because of the ball, the maneuverability is amazing.  The only drawbacks I see are the ball doesn't allow you to get under some furniture, so it must be moved to vacuum those areas.  Also, the canister is so small, it needs to be emptied really often.  But this is easy enough to do.  At first thought, I would claim to have to see how long the vacuum lasts to determine if it's worth the money.  But after thinking about it, my carpet looks better from the first use.  This is a carpet cleaning system that I will enjoy and take good care of for the price, and will seriously consider replacing with another Dyson when the time comes.",3,"[-2.4715946612808093, -1.554918579791037, -1.3683718453908305, -1.0343291749450336, -1.0464925601901722]",-1.0343291749450336

In 1923, treasure hunters Rick O'Connell (Fraser), Evelyn Carnahan (Weisz), and Jonathan Carnahan (Hannah) accidentally set him free.  It's up to the intrepid trio -- with a little help from their friends -- to set things right before the Mummy destroys the world.  You've got a good deal of action and adventure with some serious romance thrown in, too.

If you don't mind the slash and burn style archeology from ""Indiana Jones"" with a lower ick factor and a bit more comedy, you'll enjoy ""The Mummy.""

This cable is slightly thicker than the Apple OEM. If you need an extra for the car or your travel bag, it will keep your iPod charged and your tunes flowing.

Usually aftermarket cables offer significant savings over similar offerings from Apple. In this case, the savings are modest, but I feel the beefier cord makes it likely to last longer in demanding environments.
