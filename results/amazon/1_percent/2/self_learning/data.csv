It was a good idea for a plot, just dropped,
There are 69 critical reviews always check critical reviews before one clicking. I learned my lesson.
It is young, The writing was childish. It is like the writing was all over the place.

It was to much stupidity, I did not finish this book. The worse part is I did not start the book til 10 days after one clicking so I am stuck with something I did not like because I can not refund it.
I do not like cheating. These characters are just so young, you would think they was in middle school. Actually middle school students probably are more mature then this.

Certainly the most confusing movie I've seen, this film instantly landed a spot in the top 5 worst films I have fallen victim to.

How did it get made?  That's the real mystery.  There weren't better scripts out there?  I could write a better script if I simply sat on the keyboard.  (Believe it or not, after this turd, somebody actually gave this guy money to direct another movie -- although not based on his script.)

It's like they gave a 14-year-old kid millions of dollars to make a movie and a single afternoon to write a script.  The script has no ideas or insight about anything -- terrorism, war, the media, the political machine, Marxism, you name it.  The movie is impossible to take literally (everybody's looking for Boxer, yet he can just go to a sidewalk cafe?), yet has nothing coherent to say on any allegorical level.

There are too many characters and the connections between them are unclear.  That voiceover guy seems to never stop introducing the movie, which initially reassures you since you're constantly confused, but clarity never comes.

Plus it just goes on forever.  Supposedly Andrew O'Hehir called this film ""about the biggest, ugliest mess I've ever seen.""

I mean, despite what the blurb suggests, it doesn't even have a main character. What do you do with a book that doesn't have a main character or couple? What do you do? (As an aside, that blurb is totally inaccurate anyway.) There's no plot. The characters do everything from pine for one another to assassinations to buy a horse that randomly gets bitten by a snake. There's insta-lust and a relationship that goes from 0 to 4,000 in about a page. There is endless agonizing over if the characters are a couple yet and if they're gay or not, all in artificial and exaggerated ways. There's pointless past trauma that is too much to be believed.

There is telling, telling, telling about how wonderful and significant and 'I'll be with you forever even though we've been a couple for 2 days' the characters feel, all adding up to basically nothing. Nothing that happens is believable. None of the emotions read as believable, not even the lust (though that's not really an emotion, I suppose). These men are supposed to be super elite soldiers and assassins, but they agonize over everything like teenager, and I don't just mean the emo stuff (though that's non-stop from page one) but if a teammate gets injured or is doing his part of a mission out of sight or killing. All the things a highly trained soldier would take in stride (and we're told they do) they are shown to whinge about. And the technical aspect of these soldiers?

It was so almost a good book, really.  Almost.  But I skipped huge chunks because I was disgusted beyond belief at how beyond stupid-gone-to-seed the heroine was.  STUPID. Another one of those women who know better than everyone around her so subsequently endangers everyone around her.  Then there were times ""No I'm not doing that"" then two seconds later she's doing it - or the Hero is. The continuity was pretty bad - I mean I know people change their minds but constantly, Every other page?  I really hated the heroine. I cursed my Kindle and wanted to throw it when she did stupid things. She was so doggone immature, selfish, self-centered, and I challenge you to believe she really loves the Hero. Love gives not takes. Love thinks of others first not themselves.  I got to the point that I didn't care about her past - it made her selfish so who cares?

OK OK - I'm fine now.  I really did want to like the book.  It's not bad but when I skim that much, it's also not that good. Once I take a dislike to a character I always HOPE they somehow redeem themselves so I can like the book - that never happened.  I won't be reading the next in the series because, honestly? I can't take the pain of her stupidity and I just flat don't care. AT ALL

9640,"I have been using Plantronics for about 20 years. Whenever I buy a home phone system, I make sure it has a headphone jack for my Plantronics headsets. They are always the best and the only ones I trust.

I recently purchased a Panasonic phone system. They are poorly made and the headset jacks are loose. Within months all of them did not hold my headsets anymore. When I saw this phone I figured I could not lose. I would have the phone and the headset.

I love the size of this phone. I work from home and it is small and fits on my waist band perfectly. I love that the plug is up top. On my other phones they were on the side and if you hit something, like walked into something, it would unplug. The keypad is small but I have tiny hands so I find it perfect for my needs. Comfort wise it is the most comfortable phone I have ever owned.

The thing that is preventing me from giving it a full 5 stars is the sound. It is a bit tinny and I have a hard time hearing people. I can turn up the volume but it just makes them louder with the tinny sound. After a few hours it is hard to adjust to and I need a break and switch back to my other phones.

I am a great fan of almost all the stars especially Michael Douglas and Shia LaBeouf.  I finally thought how bad can it really be and ordered it on demand on cable.  I am writing this review to warn everyone - with this movie it honestly is not a matter of opinion, the movie is just plain terrible.  I don't get how people are going overboard criticizing the acting for there is very little for any of the actors to do.  I blame this disaster on Oliver Stone and him alone.  He is obviously trying to make a statement on money, its business etc.  No point is made and there is no story.  All the actors walk through each scene like zombies for the entire script is ridiculous.  There is no emotion for the acrtors to grasp onto.  The scenes where tears are shown are laughable for they are so poorly written and directed.  With this movie there is no beginning, middle or end.  When it was finally gratefully over I just felt like I had wasted 2 hours.  I had no idea what the point of it all was.  I really want to know what power Oliver Stone used to convince all these A list actors to participate in this terrible film.  He has created and directed a true mess.

I very rarely write such negative reviews but I must be honest and feel people considering watching this film or even God forbid purchasing it should be warned.

In the first book, Dons quirkiness (somewhere on the Aspergers Spectrum) was a major player in the book, but it wasn't the only player.  The other characters seemed to have more to contribute.

In this book, Dons behavior seems so forced and so contrived.  Every single thing he says and does is tainted with his quirkiness, to the point of absolute annoyance.

For example, a woman is about to breast feed her baby.  Here is the quote from the book:

The discussion was interrupted by the arrival of a nurse carrying a baby which I assumed was Sonia and Daves.  I was well aware from the Antenatal Uproar that social convention took precedence over maximizing immunity through the sharing of breast milk.

Sonia commenced the nutrition and immunity-improving process.

That last sentence was just annoying.  I cant see Don looking at every single thing like this.  I just don't remember the first book being so constantly over the top like this.

The intriguing idea is two dopey teens poking around an abandoned mental hospital discover a naked girl chained down to a table who isn't alive.  But she's not exactly dead either.  But she's hot, for a zombie.  And naked.  You can see the possibilities coming but the film doesn't decided whether it's a horror film or a comic horror film.

In fact, the script doesn't make a lot of decisions that help with the great idea.  Why couldn't the more thoughtful teen dig through the lab to find out who the girl was and how she ended up chained to a table?  The writers indulged the scumbag teen who uses the deadgirl for his own gratification but left the other teen thinly developed and weak.

I admire the filmmakers for independently creating a vision...but the vision wasn't prepped enough to become a professional horror film.  Characters aren't developed, ideas aren't followed through, good ideas are thrown in but then left incomplete.

There were gasps, but there were a lot of laughs (I saw it in Santa Monica).  The house wasn't full, but I realized that this movie will probably do better when it hits DVD and the stigma of being seen going to it won't be as bad.

Kind of like porn.

Like some of their best stuff, the creators of TEAM AMERICA are very hit and miss.  But when they hit, it's into the stratosphere.

Rarely have I seen a movie that manages to make fun of so many things to so many people.  There's bound to be at least one thing that will offend anyone reading this, but you'll probably have a couple really hard laughs at other scenes.

They've taken the ridiculous medium of puppetry (remember the THUNDERBIRDS from childhood?) to play out a brainless Hollywood action film, but they've also satirized the brainless Hollywood A-list of celebrity/activists (including ""the greatest living actor of all-time, Alec Baldwin"").  The constant barrage of bad language detracted from the overall film--but these are the mind behind ""South Park,"" so there you go.

It just flew at me, paragraphs here and there, glued together to make a chapter.  Then suddenly none of that mattered. I was sucked in (finally) to Winter and Braxxon's (and everyone else) life and wanted to know the ending NOW.  So I pretty much read it in one day.

While some of the topics are pretty graphic and ugly, none were gratuitous. The writing was okay but I think the author will continue to get better and better.  She has amazing insight into some pretty terrible things, and handles them very well because there is pain, sorrow and heartache that shouldn't be trivialized. Some things I did NOT like were a lack of realism in things like the hero knows it is unbelievably dangerous for his woman to be going out but he lets her go somewhere with only another woman with her, a woman whose loyalty he questions?  Huh?  That doesn't fit with all the other wise choices they make to keep safe.  Things like that.

Now, he fails not because of the patriotics, the stupidity, the cliches, whatever... he fails because he wrote a bad screenplay, and obtained half-hearted performances by his lead actors.

1. There's too many characters, and though they all intermingle eventually, you just can't keep track of all of them and their relations.
2. I can never feel for any of the characters. There's nothing there but how they handle situations. No feelings, no thinking things through. No emotions. I don't know what to think of any of them.
3. They're just plain boring. That's the only way to say it. The plots start off okay, but they just float away to other things that are of no importance that are distracting.

The problem with this one is there are virtually no laughs in it at all. Despite a decent cast (""SNL"" vets Bill Hader and Andy Samberg, McLovin from Superbad and Tami Taylor [Connie Britton] and Jason Street from ""Friday Night Lights,"" Rachel Bilson of ""The OC"" fame, Troy from ""Community"" and Agent Coulsen from ""Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.""), it just tries too hard for the gross-out humor and lacks anything clever.

Basically, Easy A beat them to the punch with a better cast and script.

Throw in the odd choice to place the movie in the '90s yet a lot of it looked more like the '70s was bizarre. Seriously, most high school movies are in the now as it's teenagers who watch this fare by and large. Unless I'm missing some untapped group of people in their late 30s who want to relive the '90s?

So I was hesitant to pick up Losing It. I actually objected to the whole synopsis, right from the beginning. I'm not going to preach on about how girls should consider their virginity a treasure blah blah, because (and yes this may be TMI!) I didn't. However, the fact that Bliss is still a virgin and seemingly suddenly decides to find a random guy to 'lose it' to didn't really sit right with me. And in fact, in the opening scenes of the book, she seems to keen to get it over and done with, I wondered why if it had been bothering her so much she didn't do something about it sooner....

As the story progressed, I came to like Bliss a lot more than I thought after my initial impression. She's funny, awkward and more than a little confused about exactly what she wants in life, love and her career so she's very easy to relate to. I did think that Garrick was sweet and a genuinely nice-guy, but I didn't actually feel that character crush moment - perhaps having an English boyfriend myself has made those British accent's a little less enthralling ;).

There was the expected and inevitable drama and misunderstanding, and some turmoil and sneaking around with the whole professor / student relationship which did feel like it wasn't taken all that seriously and some passionate and well written intimate moments (man I feel old calling make-out / sex scenes 'intimate moments!).

Losing It isn't completely predictable, but it didn't set my world on fire either - it's the kind of book that I enjoy when I don't really want to have to think about what I'm reading or struggle with emotional or moral dilemmas Overall this was a fun read, and I breezed through it pretty quickly.

As other readers have noted, some of the grammar and syntax was confusing to the point that some sentence structures were unreadable.  Someone should have proofed this novel a bit more.  You can't blame the author for not seeing all of his own mistakes, but someone should have.

Other than that, it was an enjoyable read and I've moved on to the third novel.  It still has some grammatical issues, but not quite as many as the second novel.

Some of the battle ballistics didn't seem very ""newtonian"", but I read the novel quickly, so they might make sense.  I do believe that the effects of deceleration may have been confused with acceleration.

Beyond the fact that it was rather formulaic, which many books are these day, but it didn't really do anything to make this formula of a story stand out from the others.  If anything it bored me.  I found myself frustrated with the characters lack of communication (I hate when that is the sole reason a couple has issues) and found myself skimming a large section of the book.  Even with skimming I didn't finish the book as quickly because I kept putting it down.  I lost interest in the characters as a couple but still wanted to know how things would end. Funny enough the epilogue was the one part of the story that I did not skim and was intrigued by.

Liese and Ryder just did not feel very three dimensional to me. I wanted to learn more about them but never felt like I did and that resulted in a missed connection.  Supporting characters worked well, even the stalker issue that came up.  However, the way that issue ended was very abrupt for me and a little unfinished.

For me there was a lot of potential here but it just fell short.  The plot could have been developed more, the characters even more so.

621,"This should really be a 3.5-star review (which, by the way, is the current ""average"" rating on Amazon as I write this), but Tom Perrotta is a serious writer and I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.

I've never read anything of his before, and I suppose it was the science-fictiony aspect of this book that intrigued me enough to read it.  It's an interesting premise, and Perrotta executes it nicely, with a soupcon of satire/sarcasm for religion and suburbia, among other things.  In the hands of someone like Lionel Shriver, the book would have been far more biting and negative and more of a challenge to get through; I'm grateful to Perrotta for that, because I find each of Ms. Shriver's books harder to take than the last one.  For one thing, even though he pokes fun at just about everyone in the book, he seems to like each of his characters in some way, even if it's just a little bit.  (In contrast, Shriver's books remind me of the old Tom Lehrer lyric ""and I don't like anybody very much"".)  In other words, there's a sweetness to the book that is endearing.

Is it a great novel or great literature?  I don't think so.  Will I read any of his other books now?  I don't feel particularly drawn to them - I've read enough satires of suburban life, religion and so on that I don't feel the need to read more of that.  However, this was an easy and enjoyable read, and thought-provoking in a light, pleasant way.",1,"[0.06112815937463556, 1.862713238868691, -1.7956103864753723, -1.105608866593643, -1.6640421493974702]",1.862713238868691

Well in the 90's Hollywood's gas tank was on empty, we had a decade of movies made from long dead TV shows (Beverly Hillbillies, Brady Bunch, etc.) We still have it today with Charlie's Angels and Starsky and Hutch. To mix it up a bit, the suits are now presenting us with an endless supply of Marvel Comic Superheros. Spider-Man, good. Hulk, bad. Cat Woman? Bottom of the barrel.

The title of this movie could have been ""Watch Halle Berry run around in a cat-suit, you know you want to"". That's really about it. I'm not a Halle Berry fan. I don't think she's all that. Maybe she would look better if she wore her hair like a woman.

Removing two stars because I've been hassled by telemarketers since the day they ported my phone number. I had ZERO problems with telemarketers before Ooma. Now I get constant scam calls. Two things: first, if you're on the do not call registry, they don't tell you this, but you need to sign up again once you port your number. Then, someone has clearly sold my info to telemarketers, and there's no warning of this, either. The only solution Ooma offers is to sign up for premier service to block the numbers-- so basically, now I would get to pay a monthly fee to fix a problem Ooma created. No. And the free call blocking program NoMoRobo doesn't work with Ooma Basic.

I called customer service about this and they promised to have a supervisor call me back. No one ever called me back.

Angry.

--
I thought this was too good to be true, but it's actually real. Setup was simple, the number was ported within a week, no echos or delays, and it's been reliable and clear ever since. I'm now paying less than $5 a month for taxes instead of the 35 or so that I was paying with my cable company. I can use it with my existing phone system and its built-in voicemail or use their voicemail, or both-- which is the option I'm going with-- my old phone system wouldn't kick over to voicemail if I was on the other line, but now it does because of Ooma.

7412,"After looking at the selection of RFID wallets, I decided on this make and model. I have been unable to find anything wrong with this wallet as outlined in some of the negative reviews. I chose the brown color. The wallet is  made from very thin material and , yes, there is a crinkling sound when the wallet is opened and closed or the bill separator flap is moved. I don't see this to be an issue and just people nit-picking. I've only had the wallet a day or so and it is holding my stuff firmly in place and I don't see anything that would indicate the wallet is fraying or coming apart..., yet.
Now, this wallet is definitely overpriced by about $10-$12 dollars in my estimation. It does feel cheap and I guess the RFID blocking works. I have no easy way to check. I did receive an email asking me to give the wallet a 5 star review for reasons I find unworthy and objectionable.
This is not a 5 star wallet if all factors are considered. I 've had expensive wallets from Italy and this is not in the same class. My review is taking into consideration the price, workmanship and what it is supposed to accomplish with RFID blocking.
In conclusion, the material is thin and the wallet feels cheap and the price is high. On the other hand, I think t was the best pick from the Amazon RFID wallets. I don't expect this wallet to last more than one year at the high end.

The struggle to get this book to the publisher shows in every chapter of clunky plot devices and hackneyed story lines. The fact that ""Eric left some stuff in a closet"" became a painful lynch pin of the action shows how little Harris cared about the quality of this book.

The premise of the story had potential but I found the storyline actually was forgotten and lost. It was replaced with constant sex, that contradicted the characters backstories. Much of the prose was quite repetitive and i will say the word detonate now leaves a sour taste in my mouth.
Kian, the main character had merits in his protective and caring nature.
Brynn was an interesting character and I think she could have been so much more given her history and where she was coming from. Unfortunately, I felt she often contradicted herself with her actions given the fears she held.
Overall the story did not draw you in-- it was repetitive and the sex was filler rather than story.
The secondary character Sage and her backstory seemed like it was thrown in and didn't really go anywhere or make you really want to find out more about her.
There truly was so much potential to this story but it fell short. And honestly if an ebook is going to cost $4 it really should be edited. There were countless spelling and grammatical errors-- many of them affected how the sentences read.

The book is really well written, and the author has an amazing imagination, but this is a tough book to get through. Not only do you have to pay super close attention to all the minute details, but her vocabulary is way beyond that of the recommended age group (ages 10-14).

7762,"I have to wholeheartedly recommend this crevice tool for vacuum hoses.  In essence, this is just a cheap tube that you insert into the hose of your vacuum. For me, I had to force it in, but it did ultimately fit. I worked it into the lint filter opening of my dryer, after removing the lint screen. I am hyper-vigilant in clearing out that screen, but I always worry about a build up of lint inside the machine. As I worked with it, I could hear ""clumps"" of lint going into the crevice tool. At one point, I had to cut off the vacuum because so much went in that it clogged the narrow opening of the attachment! I removed it from the vacuum and had to use a blunt tool to loosen the clog and knock out the rest. Immediately, I emptied the canister of my machine, and there was a good deal of lint. I know that it was not carpet dust that had been there before, because it all had a very strong perfume smell of detergent and softener.

To be sure that all the dryer lint was removed from the attachment, I carefully ran water through and stood it upside down overnight to drip dry. I ordered this thinking I was just taking a gamble on something that probably would not work at all, and to my delight it works perfectly. I am going to use it repeatedly until I am certain that no clogs remain, and then I'll switch to general maintenance.

1847,"A difficult book to read and significantly more difficult to review.  The difficult part of reading and reviewing was the struggle to suppress my own emotions.  The writers attempt to reveal the mistreatment of Muslim women in particular is noble.  Her life story is one of many emotions, trials and tribulations and the efforts on her part to seek equality on behalf of others reveals a great mind in a great person.  It should be fair to say there are many more like her stymied by their religion and background and yet of equal mind if not courage.  I say this because no single ethnic group or religious sect has a monopoly on brains regardless of gender.  Many people are simply what they are taught to be.  To avoid offending anyone I seldom discuss or give thoughts on religion.  I am not knowledgeable enough to discuss the various aspects of the various religions but like many (I suspect) I entertain my own thoughts and opinions.  While this book taught me some about the particular religion involved it made light of the brutality of life for women living under the justification by that particular religion.  I despise anyone involved in the mistreatment of women.  Certainly in my life I have known bar flies who maybe rated a dope slap but the constant abuse and mistreatment of any woman rates as a punishable sin.  I cannot always say they are the fairer sex unless by fairness one means their attitude and treatment of others, male or female.

One was a book about the international sex slave trade (still not available in the USA until this fall) and the second was IF ON A WINTER'S NIGHT A TRAVELER.

The little blurb said this book had ten Chapter Ones.  You read that right.  One book, ten first chapters.

I wrote these titles down and ordered the latter after I got back home.  And I just finished it.  Wow.

I won't try to explain everything that goes on in this book but I can tell you--and this was the part that really surprised me--I was able to follow it all.  Even when I suspected about two-thirds of the way in that my attention would waver and I'd lose complete track of this strangely-written book, I still knew what was going on.  I have to chalk that up to the writer.  I've gotten lost in far more conventional stories after wading through thick and ponderous writing...but not this one!

I thought the beginning of the movie where the two high school girls discover roller derby and where Ellen hangs out and meets her future boyfriend at that house party rang so true in a ""wonder of it all discovering life outside the boredom of Small Town America"" type of way.

I got tired of the constant explaining of the ""rules"" of roller derby and the Jimmy Fallon (seriously, Jimmy Fallon?) arena-side announcing was just unnecessary.

The story follows the typical Hollywood script--girl meets roller derby, roller derby meets girl, girl meets boy, boy goes on tour with band, parents get angry she is secretly roller derby-ing, crying and anger ensue and in the end all is forgiven and everyone sees the light (bar the stereotypical sensitive alterna rock boyfriend).

Anyway, for what it is it's just OK. It could have been far better and in a way Kansas City Bomber with Raquel Welch is far superior (and I am being both literal and sarcastic on that note).

Put down the pitchforks. I have Hooker dialed up on my Kindle and will be diving in shortly because, damn, I need to know more!

And speaking of more, lets chat about the fabulousness that is Ace and Dylan. Theyre near perfection from the beginning. Love how they meet. Love how they are when they're together. I love feeling all the feels with these two men who find it so hard to let down their guards, to trust, to feel, to love. Ace and Dylan are true magic together. And hella sexy too. No, seriouslyswoony, panty-melting sexy. Dont say I didn't warn you.

The only thing I do not love is the realization that August is still a month away and Ms. Frank and Ms. Blaine have left me standing on the edge of a cliff, holding my breath.

1131,"It seems from most of the reviews posted you either hated this novel or loved it and can;t understand why anyone would bash it.  Let me explain why you would bash it.  It's not that good.  Don't get me wrong, it's not terrible, but it's quite a dissapointment when you think 'hey, isn't this Palahniuk?' and just can't believe that he put his name to it.  If it were any other auther, it may be good, maybe even great, but not when you come to set standards for the authers writing.  I happen to have high standards for Palahniuk because most of his work is just utterly mind-blowing.  I think the problem here is that you wait for this explosive ending (Lulliby, Fight Club) and you end up getting something that just sparks.  It's like waiting for a fireworks show and getting some cherry-bombs and a bottle rocket.  It's just now what you wanted.  The story has potential.  You have a comotose man who, before going under wrote a buch of creepy things in peoples homes all over this island and now his wife is having to clean it up as well as try and decipher what he means.  The only thing is, even if the ending is kinda surprising, it just isn't written well.  It leaves you wishing Chuck had explained a little more, or at least a little differently.

Lauren Layne is my number one author. She is my go to girl when I need to read a good book. You know, when you are in a rut and want a GOOD book??? Lauren is it for me. She is my spirit animal. My soulmate. My fav. She is it for me.

Someone Like You had me giddy and wiggling all around when I read it. When I was reading the book, Adele was playing in my head. I was signing her version of ""Someone Like You"" and thinking, this book is as good as the song!

I feel in love with Lincoln the second the book started. Swoon!! He is my everything wrapped in one. He is sensitive and sweet and handsome and sarcastic all rolled into one !

Then there is Daisy. I can't not think of one bad thing to say. She was awesome in her own rite. When you put them together, you have something special. Alone, they are good, together they are better. See, each of them has their own past (but don't we all) and when they become friends, they complete each other.

2.  Cord is too short.
3.  Steam?  You coulda fooled me.  I pumped, pushed, pulled & saw only two tiny puffs.  In two rooms.
4.  On/off?  Why, the high-tech way, of course.  Plugging it in for ON; unplugging it for OFF.
5.  Water, water everywhere.  This thing doesn't steam floors, it bathes them.
6.  Exhausting.  After just TWO SMALL ROOMS.

3744,"This is my 3rd book by Amy Harmon. I love how she reaches in and pulls every emotion out of you. This is a book I couldn't put down, and it was worth every bit of sleep I lost.
Just a day ago I read a book that brought out raw emotions, I cried a lot. I read through the tears. But this book, this one was all together different.

Making Faces, is about facing ones own demons and finding that beauty is beyond skin deep.

Amy has a way of using the bible to teach us there is so much more out there, something greater than us.... God.
She does it in a way that you catch the meaning & the lesson behind it without it sounding preachy or in your face.
Love heals all, forgiveness sets us free.
I love the honesty of her books.

I'm not gonna lie, I didn't just cry....  I bawled my eyes out! I felt the sadness, I felt the loss and I felt the love & the strength to breathe again.

This book just wasn't engaging me.  I cant exactly pinpoint the reason, but I think it has to do with some sloppy story telling.  Man!  How I hate to say that about one of my favorite authors!  But there were things in this story that just didn't make sense to me.  In most cases, I find Jill Shalvis to write smart stories.  This one had too many holes for me.  This is the peril of reading a favorite author from their earliest stuffsometimes you're going to get some not so stellar stuff.

I actually adored the hero, Noah.  I think it would have helped to have actually relived his issue that kept his grounded for 6 months.  It would have given me a deeper connection to him and a better understanding of his frame of mind.  Once I knew what he had been through I did feel bad and sympathize for him, but I felt a sort of disconnect from the event since Noah doesnt even really have flash backs or anything.

The heroine, Bailey, was likable but I didn't love her.  Ive seen some reviews saying shes an idiot.  I don't think thats true.  Thats where things come back around to plot holes.  I don't want to give anything away, but since when do people not look behind artwork for safes?  Theyve been doing that since the dawn of time (or the popularization of houses and safes anyway).  That was one of my biggest issues with this story.  Bailey wasn't doing anything that the goons who were after her couldn't have done without her.  Silly.

One of my pet peeves was played out in this book and Im sure that had a lot to do with my disinterest in it at times.  The constant withholding of important information to protect other people, talking in circles, trying to take a huge task on alone when its obvious that impossible.  Over and over and over.  It was too much!

I was really disappointed.  I found both Sed and Jessica incoherent,  badly written characters who were impulsive and fundamentally uninteresting.  Anyone who likes to have sex with famous people in public,  can't be devastated if it's caught on video.  Jessica seemed to have no ability to project into the future.  It would absolutely harm her future in corporate america if she worked as a stripper,  but still,  she did it. It would absolutely make a difference to her law school if a sex tape came out,  but still she kept putting herself in situations where it was almost inevitable.  Sed and Jess loved having sex with each other but didn't understand each other at all,  and by the end I was happy to leave them

2506,"The first graphic design error is choosing a red border for a book of black and white photographs.  The red is extremely distracting from the image, and borders every single spread.

Another major mistake is the layout of the photos themselves.  The full spread images are spliced in half by the binding, some are also split into sections of nine for no apparent reason, and others are split into sections of 9 with different sized photos taking up different segments.  I'm sure he thought he was being edgy, but it breaks too many visual rules.  It's extremely distracting and makes it hard to focus on any of the images.

All of the images seemed like third world street photography and seemed like they could have been taken anywhere.  While it was interesting to see the wide variety of ethnic groups that live in the area, there wasn't a cohesive story or enough information to carry the images and they didn't speak for themselves.  The descriptions were very brief captions, and for a several hundred page book, the brief essay at the front and little captions wasn't enough.  I wasn't really sure what mattered about the images I was looking at and it seemed like anyone who went there could have taken the same images.  There wasn't anything remarkable about them, other than it was a place not many people in the US travel to.

I'm also a photographer and it seemed to be like the book might have been shot in black and white film.  Since the work was done so recently, that's a little perplexing to me since I don't think it benefited him.  The quality was just not up to par - the images were grainy and many were out of focus.

Maybe I am used to erotic books but this was really boring in that aspect.

My hesitations were well founded.  It's just not well-written.  The pace of the novel is so slow that it is almost glacial.  The story will move along very slowly and then the main characters will spend a number of pages going over events from the past.  It doesn't seem to want to move along.

It's hard to believe the same person who wrote TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD wrote this book (even it was a first draft or whatever).  Part of me wishes that her editor had done a lot of work on this book.

This book does not make me think less of the characters since they just seem so remote from the original characters...almost no connection at all.

lot of parts that seemed to drag and didn't really move the story

hour TV show type plot that tried to make it into a full length movie.

The funny thing is Tessa is 17 so she is really supposed to be immature.  She has been in an all girl boarding school very sheltered.  As for Bodi I really didn't care to much for him, and I don't even know why.  Tessa at one point was drinking  and she goes to lay in Bodi's bed, all I could think was when was the last time he changed his sheets, is she going to brush her teeth wash her face.

And then there are those books that scream at you and each word tumbles into your soul and fills you up and has you turned inside out and outside in and whispers to your heart and thats when a book turns into something much more than just a book... Kennedy Ryan is a mastermind when it comes to joining words together to make a story ( that is so much more than just a story its a journey). She takes your heart with her hands and pumps her words through you and breaks your heart because the words the words are so much more they are jagged pieces that cut they are real and their edges will cut.. and then she takes that same heart she just shredded and puts it back together.

I can sit here and say this book didn't make me feel, but that would be a big, fat lie because, oh did it. My heart shattered and my emotions were all over the place.

Natalie Gilcher is happy and content. Shes married to her high school sweetheart and shes pregnant. Her husband Aaron, is away on a convert mission overseas and is expected home really soon. Being a NAVY wife, Natalie knows the protocol and she experiences firsthand the dreaded moment that no person should ever be a part of.

That knock at the door.
Aaron is gone and her world is shattered.

Natalie is dead inside and only lives for her daughter, Arabelle. Shes alone and not even the comfort of her friends and family can pull her out of the void she feels.

Then we meet Liam Dempsey.
Liam is Aarons best friend. He comes into her life and spins her world upside down. The more time spent together, the more they feel attracted to one another until they can no longer deny what they feel.

Oh Liam *sigh*. Dreamboat is beautiful, a NAVY Seal, sweet, swoony, sexy and protective. He loves Ara and hes absolutely PERFECT!! Natalies strength saves him. Shes that light he needs, the one he can look forward to when he goes into battle.

Together Liam and Lee endure loss and pain. But they fight and they overcome the ghost of Aaron. They love and feel, and there wasn't one moment they weren't respectful of Aarons memory.

This story taught me that sometimes its pointless to fight the strong feelings. That sometimes you just have to take the bull by the horns, so to speak. But most of all, that its okay to believe in love again.

I hate to give top rating to a book with crude sexual remarks and scenes in addition with some profanity, but this was truly a well-written book with a great story. Of course I cannot share it with my family and friends because of embarrassment. It was so good I could barely put it down. It is a shame good writers cannot see their talents and literary abilities is great enough they do not have to muddy the story up with sexual explicitness or outward profanity.
This is a tender story of a woman becoming a 'mail order bride'after losing her only child. She wasn't totally honest in her letters and had 'friends' write her references to become the man's bride and mother to his children. She couldn't tell him she had been raised in a saloon and her mother was one of the 'working' girls. She had not chosen that life for herself and only wanted out of there. Things seemed OK at first but her past seemed to keep getting in her way. She didn't think she could ever love again nor bear another man to touch her.
This tale is full of emotions and is full of adventure and intrigue. I just wish it hadn't had been spoiled.

Yes, it's a hot erotic story. Unfortunately the story is too big for the main character, Nonnie, who recently divorced has NEVER had any experience in BDSM, nor even fantasies about it the way the book reads. I found that quite unbelievable as she ends up in not one, but two scenes with different Doms with completely different styles. No. This story didn't do it for me... so many inconsistencies with what a real life woman would be like. Really? You meet up with some young gal at a bar where you met The Businessman, and leave this bar with her to go to a BDSM club? Just like that? NO!

I didn't think it was possible to create such a world in a story that takes place in an average city in an average time. But, she did. Now, there were no dragons in this story, but there was plenty of magic and plenty of the fun and imagination that I really enjoy in Donita's stories.

I was pulled into this story very quickly because I liked Cora right from the start. She is a very nice and likable character. She is a character that I felt an instant connection with and one that I felt deserved happiness - and deserved to go to a magical ball. It also didn't take long for me to like Simon, and of course, his sister Sandy stole the show many times.

I would say the only part of the book that I didn't love was the end. It was the happy ending I was hoping for, but the book just sort of ended and it felt a little flat.

1543,"I was annoyed and frustrated through 80% of this book. The reason is, that by my standards, the author does not play fair with the reader. Here are two examples. The book opens with the protagonist having a breakup fight with his girlfriend. Some of the characters in the book know the reason for this fight and how it relates to another incident, known by almost all, they discuss but which is held from the reader. Instead, they make oblque references to both.

This leaves the reader ignorant but the books players informed unlike, say, an Agatha Christie novel where the reader is invited along to solve the mystery with the protagonist and both parties having equal information.

Then again, this withholding of information results in a final 20% that has an enormous impact on the reader. Ive rarely read a book that has this much power, excitement and satisfaction in the wrap up. Its plainly masterful. All the loose ends get tied, plot get mysteries solved and were finally clear or at least less muddled if were reading a thriller, a mystery, a horror novel or a supernatural tale. I wasn't sure until the end and, in a way, still am not.

Another issue is that the protagonist isn't likable  even in the least. By the end, many will have sympathy for him while others will detest him. Im in the latter camp, but I do understand the fellow maybe more than I wish to.

I can recommend this book without reservation, but wish the author would have somehow avoided creating that sense of annoyed frustration I had through a good deal of the books length.

Keanu Reeve's acting was so bad, I wanted to stick my hand inside the screen and slap the little SOB. If there was an Academy Award for 'Ham', then I'd understand, but I don't think there is. Little boy trying to play a grown-up role is what it boils down to. Maybe he should have goton a few more chest hairs before he decided to do this.
Next, there are 'serious' action movies and then there are the campy. Both are enjoyable, but they should never cross the lines with each other.

Will and Olivia play out a complicated and forbidden romance that is written so well that I could not put this book down.  Watching these two navigate around one another and deal with the issues that Olivia is hiding was amazing and so refreshing to see a twist that I had not come across before.

51,"""The Art of Racing in the Rain"" reads like an earnest student's best effort in a creative writing program:  The writing is polished and grammatically correct, but it lacks rhythm and soul.  Writing from the perspective of a dog also rings false, disingenuous, and silly -- somehow the dog narrator has emotional maturity and the intelligence to string together a novel yet he's constrained into acting like a dog all the time?

The ending is emotionally charged, and that's the highlight of this novel.  But the way over there was stilted and boring, as were the characters themselves.  We cared little for the characters, although we grieved for their tragic lives.  But perhaps the plot was much too contrived and manipulative?",1,"[-0.2855074029398075, 1.3571113731350457, -1.4867281686300193, -1.0907775906550117, -1.4343438139730862]",1.3571113731350457

The second time I read it, though, it seemed a lot less informative and more pretentious.  The creators of the graphic novel standing around talking about their creation added nothing save, perhaps, the idea of self-reference that could have been achieved much more economically by other means.

Plus, the whole thing with the Orestia was a pompous waste of space.  Its connection to the overarching story was flimsy at best.",1,"[-0.962954822167364, 1.3279349051737168, -1.4217186107603799, -1.0858965697704372, -1.614496809903864]",1.3279349051737168

153,"I did not expect to like this book at all. From descriptions I had read, I expected it would be similar to Post Office by Charles Bukowski, which I hated, because it seemed to glorify and justify addictions. Besides, that one was not even very well written, in my opinion. But then a friend whose literary opinions I trust said Jesus' Son was ""beautiful,"" so I decided to give it a chance.

And it is beautiful. And powerful. And brutally humorous. And about the saddest book I have ever read.

In a series of very short stories, Johnson gives us a look into the hallucinatory world of a heroin and alcohol addict, and, believe me, it is not a nice place to be. The narrator seems (figuratively) to be lost in a terrifying carnival fun house with no idea how to get out, not sure of what is real and what is not any more, and having perhaps even lost memory of the ""real"" world. The ending story does give some sense of hope, even though the narrator has been perhaps irreparably damaged.

The writing combines grittiness and poetry, with the contrast making each more powerful.

This would not be a book that all would like. It is very intense and not very cheerful. It's good that it is short, because I, for one, could have not have been immersed in that world for too long without extreme discomfort. But it is, indeed, beautiful.",1,"[-0.1542677411348421, 1.3041966647127112, -1.680446499343248, -1.0802542833373483, -1.5100672982526806]",1.3041966647127112

4551,"""I have so much love inside of me thats all yours, and its been trapped inside. I need to give it to you, because holding it in is killing me.""

Once again, we have been allowed to enter the unique world of Penelope Ward. Sins of Sevin offered us a read of epic proportions that told of a love never intended, that led down roads undefined, and created paths that only few could possibly walk.

Nothing thats worth it comes easy. But when the payoff comes, it can be spectacular.

Love is beautiful. Watching two people fall in love is breathtaking.  Listening to their talks that bring them closer together makes us fall even harder for them. We cheer for them, laugh with them, and cry with them.  But we also must come to terms with their predicament and positions in life.  When we enter into Sins of Sevin, we cannot possibly be prepared for the depths that this story will take us, and the place in which we will be left in the end.

""You're my truth. Everything else is a lie.""

Sins of Sevin was such an emotional read.  Told in first person, dual points of view, leaving this book I was in a haze.  My heart and mind were so full, but at the same time had been completely emptied and left on the pages of Sevin. It was breathtakingly beautiful, but had a level of pain, remorse, and dwindling hope that made my emotions stretched.  I physically had a need to hold onto something in order to steady myself along the way.  There was so much depth and complexity represented in the story line and that followed into the characters. As usual, Author Penelope Ward established some wonderful secondary characters. One of these made me laugh so hard, and the other caused my heart to swell.  As every chapter and scene changed, I was so pulled in that I easily followed, feeling as if I were a bystander watching and listening.  Sins of Sevin is not only at the top of my taboo list, but also worked its way into my top 5 reads of 2015.

I guess the biggest disappointment with Carpenter's remake of ""Village of the Damned"" is that it stays too close to the original 1960's version, which is a true sci/fi - horror classic. I remember hoping that Carpenter would give ""Village of the Damned"" the same treatment he gave to his remake of ""The Thing"". With ""The Thing"" you had Carpenter adding his own touches, creating a movie that was similar to the original film, but still stood on it's own and came away with an 80's horror masterpiece. And while ""Village of the Damned"" is a pretty good movie, it just doesn't feel like a ""John Carpenter"" movie. You don't get that steady tension found in his other films like ""Halloween"", ""The Fog"" or ""The Thing"", where the mood and atmosphere of the movie really kept you in suspense the entire way through. Still it's not a bad movie, and worth a checking out if for no other reason to see Christopher Reeve in a non-Superman role, and to see Mark Hamill portray a slightly wacko priest.",1,"[-0.15201735287738072, 1.279790056736529, -1.6359420181391595, -1.0738887951427964, -1.8502204322154747]",1.279790056736529

He, however, is married, but the idea of a threesome comes up. And who could say no to that? I mean, what could go wrong? Well, of course, plenty, but revealing just what would be giving away too much.

The sex scenes are graphic, but they're mostly skippable, and the book revolves more on the plot and characters than on the descriptions of sex. To a certain degree, the book is vulnerable to the criticism that it is a male-written book narrated by a male character about what might be the ultimate male fantasy. I get that. But I will say that such a criticism only goes so far in this book, which ultimately subverts much of the basis for that argument.

So I suppose I must respectfully disagree with the other reviews. For me, at least, the book was a quick and generally enjoyable read, and I found the voice of David (the attorney and narrator) to be engaging and generally intelligent, some of his decisions notwithstanding. Granted, the subject matter of this book makes it automatically off limits for readers with certain sensibilities, but the title alone should have made that point clear.",1,"[-1.393992721483698, 1.251585895506266, -0.9192384038458172, -1.0520534210042796, -2.286702062675178]",1.251585895506266

Melissa Foster has written a book that kept my emotions on a roll from the beginning to the end. It definitely draws on your heart strings while at the same time will twists your emotions all over the place. I was drawn into this book from the very start and could not put it down. It captivated me in a way that no other book has before. In the end you will have your heart strings tugged on, have tears in your eyes along with laughter and smiles. So many emotions put together in one book that causing an emotional overload.

This is a magnificent story told in a spectacular way that you will not forget. This book is so addicting with the twists and turns with a mixture of romance thrown right in the middle of it. There were some twists that I did not see coming at all and then had to smack my head for not realizing it sooner.  You will finish this book with faith and hope in love along with a sense of loyalty and compassion for people that give up everything for family and love.

This was a book that captivated from the beginning to the end; each page I turned and wondered what was going to happen next. You cant help but fall in love with the characters in the book; some even more than others once you learn their history and what has made them the way that they are. This is by far one of my favorite reads this year.",4,"[-3.3506890736308574, -2.3573552590262206, -3.282610136615758, -1.1106932248215515, 1.248468955909947]",1.248468955909947

7518,"I had a Yamaha amp and 2 Klipsch speakers attached to the TV.  The amp was old and experiencing problems, so I switched to the soundbar to save money and improve spoken sounds out of the audio.

Overall, the Sony accomplishes the task very well.  I do have a slight issue with bringing audio in from the DVD and cable box.  Both use optical or HDMI but my TV monitor (LG) does not have optical out or HDMI out.  That leaves me short an optical input to audio.  I'm attempting to get a coax/2 RCA cable/connector (as you can tell, I'm not an audio guy) to solve the problem until this plasma TV gives up the ghost (9 years old).

Sound quality seems a bit 'hollow'.  But, I've just set it up and will fiddle with it some before I make a final decision.  Spoken words are MUCH clearer.  I don't need subtitles for female whispering at this point.  A nice improvement.

You can see where the influences for this author lie as in the like of Patricia Highsmith.  But when such a legendary writer is quoted as a comparison in the blurbs advertising a novel you expect the work to at least somewhat resemembe the quality of that author.  You can see author Nicholas Searle coming up with his idea for the story and it is indeed a crteative one.  But then he jumps around in his style of writing throughout which does not work for me and when the novel is moving along at a good pace semi working the plot takes a misstep or is not handled well.  Honestly Searle may end up becoming an amazing novelist.  If you enjoy following an aspiring author on his way to achieving his potential then you will enjoy this novel..  You will be able to put up with the frustrations of its limitations as you watch a novelist try to achieve his first quality work.

Each day starts out by putting our focus on the reason were celebrating  the birth of Jesus and the change He makes in our lives. The Scripture and devotional then leads into the history of a Christmas hymn, along with the printed lyrics for our reflection. Each day ends with a seasonal craft or gift or recipe to make at home.

My favorite part of this devotional is the hymn histories and lyrics. I think sometimes we become so familiar with certain songs and carols that we sing them without really thinking about what the words mean. Allowing myself to stop and reflect on what Im singing, on the true impact to my heart of words such as So God imparts to human hearts / the blessings of His heaven or Good Christian friends, rejoice / with heart and soul and voice / now ye need not fear the grave / Jesus Christ was born to save!

Bottom Line: The whole book is excellently done and very sweet. Tons of great gift ideas that will pamper the people you love and give your presents a heartfelt touch, not to mention the yummy recipes I cant wait to try!

Unfortunately, I did not enjoy Curse the Dawn, and I did not enjoy Midnight's Daughter. Dory is a kick butt Dhampir with family issues. She is not complex, not emotionally deep, and not particularly interesting. To some extent I expect that out of the genre now, but that doesn't mean I like it. I've read deep, realistic, exciting main characters, so I know it's possible. I feel like the author wanted to cram as much action as possible into this book. It's hectic, and it's not just the action, there are also plenty of sub plots and fantasy creatures. Everything was half explained so that the action could continue at it's crazy pace. The main plot is simple, kill Dracula. There are about 20 pages pertaining to just that. Everything else is danger and action. Then there are fey, mutant animals, trolls, and all sorts of other creatures thrown in. Personally, I don't think enough time was spent on anything.

Reacher finds a West Point ring in a pawn shop and decides to track down the female soldier who pawned it.  Eventually, it comes to pass that the woman has a disfiguring injury and is in a lot of pain and is buying illegal pain meds.  Reacher eventually takes on the drug trafficking ring, but it takes a very long time to get there.  This is definitely the most boring ot the Jack Reacher series.  Oh, and, by the way, the injured soldier has a chronically weeping facial wound with a deepseated infection that she doesn't want to treat with IV antibiotics because it would require a hospital stay.  Just for the record, such wounds would eventually spread to contiguous structures, such as the eyes and brain, resulting in death, or septicemia, again resulting in death.  The pain would be the least of her worries.  Of course, without  the infection and resulting pain, the story would have to be changed, which, all things considered, wouldn't have been a bad idea.
Oh, and to echo other reviewers, casting Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher is truly pathetic.

I was wrong. The conflict between the hero and his ""betrothed"" took forever to resolve and although I was initially into the story between him and the heroine, it got old watching them vacillate between lust/love. I thought the whole ""class warfare"" shtick was overdone. I grew up in Southern Mississippi and even in 2002 (when the book was originally published) we're more progressed than that small minded ""You can't marry outside your class"", crap. I highly doubt Texas would be worse than us but I digress.

I've read another series by this author before and enjoyed it tremendously and don't know what she was thinking with this book. The characters were juvenile, milquetoast beta males/females with no backbone who thought with their genitalia. The first half was decent enough to continue but it got worse the longer I read. Several breaks were needed to slog through it until the end because by the time I realized I wanted out it was already too late.

9436,"I loved this movie, and after reading some of the negative reviews, think a lot of people got hung up by watching it as a social commentary. With gay marriage such a hot political topic right now, I guess it's hard not to do that, but I really think it wasn't written to be that way. It's not a soapbox movie. IMHO it's not trying to portray lesbian marriage any certain way, or lesbians themselves, or teenagers, or sperm donors etc. It's about 5 people. 5 individuals, with very distinct personalities, psychological baggage, desires and fears. Two happen to be gay, two happen to be teenagers, and one happens to be a straight male who's never married and once was a sperm donor.

If anything, this film is about marriage and family apart from any of the individuals involved. Or rather, it's about the struggles most of us go through trying to make these things work. The unique back-stories and social milieu are part of the struggle for these particular individuals, but not the point of the story. So I don't think it's fair to judge whether these were 'real lesbians' (who gets to decide what that is anyway?) or 'real teenagers', or whether this presented gay marriage in a positive or negative light.

I think the main reason I loved this movie though is that personally I was just carried along by the characters every step of the way. I believed every single one of them. I thought these 5 individuals put in fabulous performances, and that Annette Benning's was Oscar material. I also laughed out loud at points, so that's great, too.

Know what I mean? She seemed more of just an object for her parents to fight about, and we never really got a sense of what she was going through.

And Ellen was such a drag. She was so immature, and weird. Why would Griffin want her back after the way she acted? And Griffin, while I initially felt sorry for him, I rapidly started losing my patience with him. He would stand up for himself one minute, and the next be all wishy-washy, and weak.

And if ever a movie deserved a Special Edition DVD, it's this one.  I've watched the movie plus the 13 minutes of deleted scenes and the documentary on the making of the film and I'm still hungry for more.  It deserves every second of attention.
(I'd liked to have seen more discussion of the novel but, as has been known for decades, author Ken Kesey never saw the movie and distanced himself from it.  He said it would have been like ""watching his child murdered"" or something.  Go figure.  How many novelists would have given their writing arm to see an adaption as good this one?)

Due to the audio perspective, I just couldn't finish this one - not necessarily due to the storyline or anything from the author's perspective, it is just that I found the narrator's voice about as annoying as anything I have heard in a long time.  To give you an idea of what I am talking about, to me the guy sounds very similar to the voice on all of the annoying GEICO Insurance commercials I hear on the radio.  To top it all off, each time there is a female in a dialogue, he switches to an even more annoying falsetto voice to represent his ""female"" side.

In other words, I made it through the first CD and finally decided life was too short - I would rather listen to the radio or a music CD.

Regarding the story, with the first portion I heard it really sounds like something I would pass on - shallow people, shallow characters, and really no redeeming qualities I would want to remember.

The book emphasized Fancy wanting a ""forever thing"". I was never really sure what that meant to her. It seemed like love and commitment were not enough.  Theron felt like he would never again make a long term commitment. There was an HEA, but it took an interesting path.

I did feel chemistry between Theron and Fancy at the beginning, but it was not strong. It developed over time. They argued a lot and jumped to conclusions, which was irritating.  The grandmother was an awfully selfish person

I ended up thinking of this book like white noise interspersed with little bursts of sound. Those bursts were Theron's daughter, Echo; the beauty salon ladies; and Sophie and Kate.

I don't know the size of this town, but Theron held 3 or 4 jobs. Deputy, school principal, deacon, and rancher.  This took something away from the book for me.

It's a very fine powder and it really doesn't adhere to the popcorn so the taste was non-existent until you licked the bottom of the bowl.

I would suggest spraying the popcorn with a mist of olive oil or butter spray - then toss with this stuff.  That might help lend some flavor.  As for us - we're going back to the dry ranch dressing  mix and melted sharp cheese.

The only way I can enjoy the no-calorie sweetness of stevia is in tart or acidic foods.  For instance using stevia in lemonade or to make a warm apple cider vinegar quaff.  Also it is excellent sprinkled over grapefruit.  Stevia just does not taste good to me in coffee, tea, or cocoa.  Or in baked goods unless they happen to be lemon squares.

Tate was one of Letty's tormentors in High School and she had hoped that college would be different but when Letty sees Tate in one of her classes she doesn't understand what is going on. Why is Tate there? It's been two years since the brutal incident and she never expected to see him again, let alone be paired up with him on an assignment on sex in the cinema. There are a lot of things that Letty doesn't know about Tate and as they work together she starts to unravel the puzzle that has her second guessing everything.

I enjoyed that this wasn't instal-love, they both had to work at things to get to the same place with their feelings and as they worked on everything it wasn't smooth sailing they did have their stumbles. They went from enemies to friends to lovers, a true progression of their feelings and it was a great ride to be a part of.

I am using this rug in my mud room in front of the door.  It looks really good/pretty in that spot.  This rug is not a plush & thick rug.  It is pretty but utilitarian - exactly what I was looking for.  It is thin enough to go under an open door but thick enough to collect drips & dirt from shoes.  I like that it has a rubber back so I don't need a rug pad under it.  And it is inexpensive enough that it doesn't feel too ""precious"" for dirty shoes.

The colors on the website are fairly accurate.  Very pretty & not too busy.

It came rolled & in a box.  It laid flat right away with just a little curl at the very end that had been the inside of the roll - it flattened within an hour or so.  I gave it a quick vacuum to take off the white factory fluffs - the rug does not seem to shed.  I think the fluffs were from something else because they were all white.

If you wash this in your washing machine, make sure to choose the gentle cycle.  I owned another rug just like this from the same company & washed it on the Heavy Duty setting.
The rubber back started to come apart & I had some weird shrinkage.  So now I wash on the gentle cycle.  Make sure you hang this to dry - do NOT put it in the dryer.",0,"[1.1601355531067135, 0.21281793184608544, -2.039578472801209, -1.052968765058118, -1.2784655096996431]",1.1601355531067135

I have not read the books, so can't compare the movie to them, but both my husband and I did find this funny. As others have said, it centers on the nerdy protagonist Greg heading to middle school, and trying ploy after ploy to become popular. At first he does this alongside his even-nerdier best friend Rowley, but after betraying Rowley, Greg is on his own. He has to learn important lessons about friendship and loyalty, and so the movie has a good heart in the end.

The portrayal of middle school here is pretty disturbing, as well as the cluelessness of the parents involved, and I worried about how it would impact my elementary school-aged kids, so I tried to talk about that and they all rolled their eyes and said ""Mom, it's just a movie."" They seemed to get that some of it was for comedic effect. There is also some bullying themes, and sexual innuendos (including Greg's older brother being caught with porn) that they didn't get, and I had to dance my way around a bit. But mostly I felt it was fine for elementary-aged children (every parent has to judge this for themselves of course.) The interactions between the kids feel real (for better or for worse), and my kids seemed to respond to that, and in the end the message is really about the importance of friendship. loyalty,  and being yourself, so that I could support.

1114,"Adam Sternbergh's debut novel is the type of story that tries to be a lot of things but does not always deliver on them very well.  The writing is pretty frenetic with short non-sentences and a severe lack of dialogue tags.  There seems a definite Hemingway influence on style at times and not for the better.  The story follows a garbageman named Spademan (not his real name) who makes a living by getting rid of people in a post apocalyptic New York City.  Apparently the rest of the country is fine, just not the NYC area, but whatever.  People tap into a virtual reality world to get away from the real world.  It's all pretty bleak and depressing.  Enter Grace who Spademan was hired to kill but finds he cannot for several reasons.  Suddenly the book turns into a strange techno thriller where no one is safe.  Well, no one was safe from the start, really, but things get hinkier quick.

Part of my problem with the story is that important details get dropped at awkward times and character back stories get fleshed out in weird ways.  Perhaps it is the style of writing.  Maybe the author does not want to drop too much too quickly.  Either way, the pace slows and speeds and slows and speeds like a Times Square traffic jam.  There's not a lot of character development and the apparent bad guy is such a caricature it's hard to feel any positive connections to the story.  I get why some people really like Shovel Ready.  It's a gritty noir type techno thriller.  It gets bloody and uncomfortable in the second half.  There are thrills, but they're cheap in a way.

The characterization was terribly weak and the plot was a hodge-podge that was, so often, not credible.  The blurb on this book states that Kyle is a 14-year-old when his father dies and the story takes place 12 years later.  The opposite is true, however--Kyle was 12 when his father ""died"" and the story takes place fourteen years later.
Kyle's ""father"" is never developed in a credible way and the dialog attributed to him is quite lame.  In fact, most of the dialog in the novel is contrived and unbelieveable.
The plot takes twists and turns that are almost suspenseful one or two times but fall flat the remainder.  I was not familiar with this author and the ""New York Times Bestselling Author"" on the cover definitely got my attention.  After reading the book, however, I would steer clear of other Lashner books.
I would recommend passing on this one. Random + poor dialog = DON'T BOTHER! Additionally, the syntax was really inventive and, um...annoying.

4233,Stumbling Into Love made my heart swoon. I laughed out loud and got a little misty eyed too. Simply a wonderful love story. This is Mackenzie and Wesley's story. You meet Wesley and Mac in the first book of the series Running Into Love since that one stars Fawn (Mac's sister) and Levi (Wesley's partner). You feel the magnetic chemistry between Wesley and Mac from the start. Oh my God does Wesley make my heart swoon. He's hot and protective. Mac i love her stubborn ways and her big heart. Seriously when you read Stumbling Into Love how can you not just fall in love with Wesley and Mackenzie. Oh lets not forget the ever loveable Reed family. I love the banter between the sisters and Katie their mother. You add in Miss Ina into the mix and you can't help but busting out laughing. I loved every minute of the book. I couldn't put it down. I so can't wait for Libby's book and see what antics she gets into and more of the Reed family. This is a fantastic series so far and just keeps getting better. You can tell Aurora Rose Reynolds is writing from her heart when the way she brings these lovable characters alive and makes you feel like you are part of their world.,4,"[-4.0833984746169305, -1.90924410424118, -3.255884618028947, -1.105005120195082, 1.1428199752988308]",1.1428199752988308

This book touched every single emotion I could possibly have. I cried, I worried, I smiled, I held my breath, I felt compassion. Most of all this book felt real. It was not a book that when something happened i didn't question it, it just felt right. This book was beautiful.

OMG..Rory, that girl is so strong. My heart fell out of my chest for her. I could not believe what she was going through. I felt this girls pain, this girls journey. I cheered for her while she conquered her demons. I wanted to hug her when she couldn't fight back, when she felt hopeless. One main reason this book was so great is that I completely forgot I was reading and was totally immersed into the story. I could not devour it quick enough.

I love Sam, he maybe one of my favorite book boys!! The way he fought for Rory, the way he protected her, the way he loved her it was so amazing to watch (read)! I'm not giving up on these two... not one second, they are just two incredible fighters.

Happily ever after does not come easy for these two and this book really delivers some hard times for these two. This book put my heart through the ringer! All I wanted was for these two to work it all out. In the end though Greetings From Sugartown delivered everything I wanted and gave us the conclusion Ana and Elijah deserved.

Elijah and I got off to a rocky start, but he has really won me over. He is so hard on the outside but he is really a big old romantic softie underneath it all. He really made my heart melt in this one. He doesnt always say the right thing or act the way I would really like, but at the end of it all I do love him and he has wormed his way into my heart. Then there is Ana who I simply love. That girl is made of steel and I just love how strong she is! I don't think there is anything that can stop her from getting what she wants.

The story will really keep you on the edge of your seat dying to see where it is going next. Honestly, this one will probably surprise you and it sure surprised me (in the best way of course). This was nothing like I was expecting but still everything I wanted, if that makes any sense. Not only do we see Ana and Elijah work through their ups and downs, but there is a whole different and more suspenseful side to the story. The combinations of these two elements just made it incredibly enjoyable. And of course there are some seriously delicious scenes throughout the book.

9688,"After receiving several complementary samples of the gourmet salt from the San Francisco Salt Company to consider for a review, my first question was - how do you use these salts? So I set out on an internet quest to see some ways that you could consider -

My first stop was the site of a Korean woman (Hi Hi) who shared this fabulous chocolate chip cookie recipe - topped with this salt

Chocolate Chip Cookies

2 1/2 cups packed light brown sugar
1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
2 large eggs
2 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground cinnamon
2 cups chocolate chips

1 tablespoon pink Himalayan sea salt

Preheat oven to 375.

In a mixing bowl, beat the brown sugar and butter together at medium speed until fluffy. Add the eggs and beat until combined. In a bowl, stir together the flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon, then add to the butter mixture and combine. Stir in the chips by hand.

Drop the dough onto the prepared baking sheets by rounded 1-inch balls, leaving 1 inch between them. Sprinkle a pinch of sea salt on top of each ball of dough.

Another recipe I found involved using watermelon cubes - simply cube your watermelon then sprinkle lightly over the top OR have some of the salt on the side to add to the combination of sweet and sour.

Of course, the BEST choice is to make a deep cappuccino fudge, sprinkling the salt lightly over the top for that instant salty/chocolate/sweet taste. Oh Yeah!

Of course, you can use this anywhere that you can use ""ordinary"" salt - although the fine grain makes it saltier by volume than standard table salt, so be cautious. It is that very ""extra salty"" flavor that makes it so perfect for the combination of sweet and salty.

Not just recommended - highly recommended - with chocolate, of course.",1,"[-2.045747086415496, 1.0948037707518794, -2.301953309966536, -1.0516252134800448, -0.7945713616792818]",1.0948037707518794

8661,"At only 165 pages, Off Limits is a very quick, graphically steamy hockey referenced romantic read. Though it was better than book 1, Major Misconduct, this NetGalley reviewer cant shake the feeling it had a generic feel to it. Likely because I have read numerous books with a similar theme, and the author did not do much to make this one unique. It was engaging then became extremely predictable after the heroine returned to New York following the family Christmas gathering. At least in this one, the hero and heroine were both likeable and had great chemistry.

Just keep in mind, folks, this one is short. Personally, Im not fond of novellas. To me they translate to the author wants your money but doesnt want to invest a lot of time earning it. Especially with authors who write mostly novellas. Quantity over quality sometimes becomes the end result.

Title: Off Limits, Series: Aces Hockey (Book 1.5), Pages: 165, Author: Kelly Jamieson, stand-alone, HEA, no cheating, VERY graphic/steamy scenes, very predictable, quick read.

When her cousin is raped, Briony accuses Robbie, which sends him to prison. During WWII, Celia--who has left the family--and Briony--guilt ridden by her crime--become nurses while Robbie fights in France. The book has a very lovely Virginia Wolf style to it (which I recognized before the book told me so), with the stream of consciousness, emotions, and perceptions of the characters flowing together during the momentous days. The meta-book stuff (Briony writing the book and changing the events to suit her imagination and forgive her crime) isn't as grating as I usually find that sort of thing. No, my main complaint is just how utterly boring the book is. The story is fascinating and full of potential. But it takes forever to tell.

Autumn has a tendency to push away the good in her life because she doesn't feel worthy of it. Will she push Hank away forever or can he overlook her insecurities? Will thier mutual love and sorrow for Summer keep them from having a future? Can these two broken souls heal or will they destroy any chance at happiness?

It was unrelentingly tense for the entire movie, and I came away from it more exhausted than entertained.

""The Dark Knight Rises"" did not make the same mistake. While much of the movie is tense, and often depressing, the mistakes of the previous effort were avoided. There were plenty of tension breaks and brief moments of humor in this film, even during the most critical dramatic scenes. That saved it from being a beat down of the viewer, and allowed me to enjoy the movie without the exhaustion I felt from its predecessor.

This story is epic in scope, and puts the Batman through some paces he's never faced on film before. It certainly reminds me of some of the Limited Series in the comics where he faces failure, both in action and in mind. There is depth here to go with as much action as any action junkie could desire.

It was a super quick read that gave me a break from the hustle and bustle of the holidays.  I recently downloaded this bundle pack of the first two books in the series so gave the first book a reread as a refresher.  Although this time through I found a few other issues with the writing, I decided to let the 4 stars stand.  It still works for what it seems to be meant for.

Unfortunately, those little writing issues from the first story carried over and multiplied in the second book.  While reading A Little Bit Naughty I couldn't help but wonder if the author even had anyone else read the story before it was published.  The actual story and characters are lovely and fun, but when an author writes that faithful night when she means that FATEFUL night it just takes me out of the story.  And thats not the only issue.  The writing just didn't flow and the language was elementary and these issues kept jolting me from the fictional world Ms. Rochon had created.

Yes, it has a sexy lead male, intimate scenes that have you shifting in your seat, and many other aspects that we all love, but this one felt so much more personal. For me, Willow is an extremely relatable character. Pieces of her live in all of us. Even those that project confidence or conceit, have self doubt that can't be seen by others.

Willow struggles with her self worth and a 'family' that viciously feeds those insecurities. Her situation broke my heart, but the growth that followed gave me the warm and fuzzies. This book shows how determination and the love of others can give you the drive to overcome the inner battles we all face from time to time.

Kane... I struggled to find another word to describe him other than perfect. Because if this book teaches us anything at all, it's that no one is perfect. He's loyal, caring, gentle, patient, supportive, determined, and one of the most swoon worthy characters I have read in a long time.

9391,"Most everyone reading this will be familiar with the movies already.  Personally I think the first three are great, and the fourth mediocre.  I do not hate Crystal Skull like others.  Certainly do not hate it enough to be insulted that it is included in this set like some others are.  Yes, I think parts of it were stupid.  Not even the alien part because lets face it all the movies have an element of supernatural to them (melting faces, instant mummification etc) but the things that bothered me were surviving a nuclear blast in a lead lined fridge, surviving said fridge being thrown for miles, swinging through the jungle to cover miles in a couple minutes and so on.  At least in the first three films the non-supernatural aspects were plausible, none of the ""real life"" things in crystal skull came off as even remotely believable.  There were some comedic moments and references to the old films though that if you do watch it are worth a chuckle.  I agree that it did not need to be made, and had all the hallmarks of Lucas trying to be too clever with the story, but they made 4 movies, and of course it was going to be included in this set.

The audio and video quality of the restorations of the other movies are very good.  Given when they were filmed (especially Raiders and Temple of Doom), there is only so much that could be done to get the video quality up for the blu ray transfer.  There are still some blurry and grainy portions of the older films, but I think they have looked the best they ever have on video or DVD.  Of course crystal skull has the best AV quality, but also has the most amount of special effects and green screen sequences.

The bonus disc is full of great behind the scenes and bonus material.  There is a new on set with Raiders of The Lost Ark feature, then the same features that were included in the DVD set put out years ago with the original three movies.  Personally I think it was worth it to upgrade from that version to the Blu Rays.  If you absolutely hate the fourth movie and want nothing to do with it, and are fine with having the original three, then you probably want to either wait until the discs are available in blu ray, or just stick with the original DVD set.",1,"[-1.6979385275888705, 1.061265676465839, -1.409258231651207, -1.0738465727894515, -1.6756857122349151]",1.061265676465839
7761,"So far I have just tried the Nesco Dehydrator by making Venison Jerky a couple of times. It took about 6 hours to make the batch of jerky from meat that I would normally use for roasts. The Nesco racks were filled with the venison cut into strips after preparing with a jerky mix. I was unable to use the mix provided by Nesco since it contains MSG which I and about 10% of the population is allergic to. I was disappointed that Nesco still provides this mix with the Dehydrator since it will make many people get headaches, etc. The dehydrator worked very well and is reasonably quiet and I guess that's what is most important for me. I do like the square shape, it makes sense to me since things like jerky fit into it very well. I plan to try the dehydrator with apples next. Be aware of the direction not to put the racks in the dishwasher since it could distort them, they are not hard to clean in any case. I recommend this product, just do not use the jerky mix unless you know those who will eat it are not allergic to it.",1,"[0.7413541913012185, 1.0603845308469069, -2.022738298513736, -1.1013980617011652, -1.0949927233189278]",1.0603845308469069

Sigh, So many sighs
* As I dramatically lay back on the sofa clutching my Kindle *

Santa brought me an early present this year! No exaggeration when I say I have been overly anxious to get my eyeballs on Owen's story! These Irish rock gods are some of my absolute favorites- and Owens grumpy, stoic, depressive, parental but all-sexy beast nature has made him one of my favorites- I needed to see him get an HEA. ( Does anyone know if there are support groups for situations like this? eh.. )
WOAH.
My emotions were all over the place! I love it when a novel gives me goosebumps and butterflies!
Seriously folks-
Holy fictional slayer of words this book Did. Not. Disappoint. !!!
In fact, it exceeded my expectations in the intense emotionally dark storms that brew beneath the surface for Bree and Owens need to find out why then try to save her from it. Can we say #Swoon. Bringing them together in ways the others in the close-knit family cannot, making the union between them even more of a special spark inducing bond.
The story catapults you into a world of lost friendships, family ties, trying to regain one's self and what happens when you are in with the Gallagher family.
A funny, smack the forehead ( I swear I did at least 4 or 5 times, *Owen I mean really*) hotter than Hades, sparks a flying, stubborn male- protector filled ride, but one you want to be on!

After reading about halfway through, I got bored and skipped to the end.  The big ""surprise"" twist was telegraphed early in the book so it wasn't much of a surprise to me.

Part of my issue is that the hero thought the heroine was exquisitely beautiful but it was a costume ball so he couldn't see her face.  That didn't seem believable -- as evidence by the slang term ""butterface.""

This is not your typical journal where you have a blank page with lines (or without lines) and you have to come up with something to write. Those are fine for some people, and even for some of the time. But for those of us, like me! who never know what to write and need a head start, these books are perfect!
Each page gives you suggestions of what to write, some drawings to color or doodle on, and some prayers, Bible verses etc.

This is really such a great idea for a journaling series - so much fun and room for some creativity. I just love these books!

414,"Any time you have one of those days when everything goes wrong, consider the case of the hero of this classic novel.

Julian English seems to have it all: He is the son of one of the city's most prominent men, is president of the Cadillac dealership, is married to a beautiful and intelligent woman, and socializes with the young Country Club set. And then one night, with a bit too much bootleg liquor inside him, he throws a drink in the face of a ""friend"" (who happens to have loaned his business $20,000) who is irritatingly telling long-winded stories. Julian's wife is upset and embarrassed and they argue. And the next night he further humiliates her by again drinking too much and apparently seducing a mobster's mistress right in front of her and their friends. And things go downhill from there.

This novel, set in 1930 in a fictional mid-size city, reads like a Greek tragedy, as fate and Julian's own fatal flaws combine to bring about his downfall. That the writing is very sparse and straight-forward, with a combination of slangy conversation and mundane details, makes the epic-like tragedy even more dramatic.

Although not as well known, this novel of the early 20th century is worthy to stand alongside the works of Hemingway and Fitzgerald.",1,"[-1.5052482435094205, 1.012650298695771, -1.5865744020758343, -1.0704558921741565, -1.98866556229463]",1.012650298695771

1087,"A man walks into paleontologist Richard Leyster's office with a fresh Stegosaurus head and asks if he'd be interested in coming to work for him.  Great start! Unfortunately, despite good action, so-so dialogue and an interesting story, it was weak in several parts. Frequently, characters speak Novelese, that special language reserved for fictional folks. A bigger problem is the integration of two unrelated plots. Plot I - Christian fundamentalists have a mole within the time travel organization trying to either plant evidence in support of creationism or kill the time travelers themselves.  Plot II - discovering the inventors of time travel and more startling, why human beings were allowed to use it.

Plot I is a familiar, if dreary, one - dogmatic bad guys vs progress and science. I've lived in the buckle of the Bible Belt all my life and can count on one hand the number of folks I've encountered who think the Earth is only a few thousand years old.  The author undermines all his talk about the silliness of creationism by having the characters ruminate about their own spiritual preferences (Christian).  Plot II is a real winner, a real tour de force of inventiveness that unfolds at just the right pace.

Another subject, almost a plot in itself, is the issue of causal paradox, what it is, how it is caused, how it can exist and its consequences.  One such paradox is the time travel ""leader"" known as the ""Old Man"".  We learn  that he is the same man (only older) who contacted our scientist at the beginning of the tale. Just as there are two plots, there are also two stories. Midway in the book, our hero and a band of intrepid scientists become trapped in the Mesozoic Era by our Creationist buddy. The story alternates between the past and the ""current"" time, Survivor vs CSI. The ending is really weak.

However, the reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it is too deeply religious for my tastes and, whilst I have my own strong and very personal faith, I felt this severely limits the readership and enjoyment of the book. For me it would have been a considerable improvement if the author curbed this, although I liked her linking to specific bible verses and analysis of same ~ which was interesting from an academic viewpoint.
Personally I would not purchase a book from this author nor read another of her works, which is a shame as she has talent.

7943,"I have always used liquid glues and always got stuck fingers when it dripped on to my hands while trying to fix something. This  also happened when I tried to puncture the tiny hole at the top of the tube to get it started. Glue would always spurt out with barely any pressure on the tube. I  kept a bottle of nail polish remover handy. More frustrating was the fact that there was hardly any glue in those tubes. So much was wasted.

This gel sure makes a major difference. First, the directions for puncturing the top are that you twist the top until the clicking stops. I have no idea what is going on in there, but it sure beats trying to do it the other way. When I took the top off, no glue came out until I gently pressed the sides of the bottle as directed. GEL! So nice to be able to put a drop of glue where you want it, and not have it go where you don't! This container is rigid everywhere except on a small strip on each side where you can gently press to expel the glue.

The name of the game here is ""control"". You will have control over this glue, it will not be a race to get the dripping glue where you want it. This gel sets far faster than the liquid so there is no need to hold anything together until it sets. No more need for massive piles of newspapers or other coverings under your project. A simple sheet of paper towel will be adequate.  This will free you from ""glue anxiety"". Not to mention the embarrassment (fun?) of having to pick off stuck-on glue from your fingers for days.

This book was not at all what I was expecting. It completely messed with my head!! There were times when I was thinking to myself whatl am I reading but I couldn't put it down.

The one thing I completely hated about this book was the way the men referred to women! I couldn't stand the way they called every woman b! tch! I understand their an MC but it just rubbed me the wrong way.

Mae escaped from the commune she has been raised in, it was horrendous and my heart broke for her and also all the people who are actually living in that he!! right at this moment! Mae was completely sheltered of the outside life and she struggled to come to terms with everything about living with the Hades Hangmen! There were a few times at the beginning of this book I found Mae hard to connect to but the more into the book I got the more I started liking her character.

Styks was a complete jerk for a lot of this story and I swear I was so annoyed at him I just wanted to slap and scream at him for the stupid things he had done. I hated the fact Styks struggled with his speech, I just wanted Mae to be able to fix that for him but nothing is ever as simple as that!

This book was filled with complete devastation, lust, anger, fear and probably every other emotion under the sun! It taught us there is horrendous places like The Order in the real world and how men use that to their gain! It truly disgusted me and I have to admit there were times I struggled to get through it but I couldn't set this book down and cant wait for more from this series.",1,"[-0.21413073087011236, 1.0033679464016823, -2.2598758153426854, -1.1152614178783977, -0.2573684133326376]",1.0033679464016823

3632,"I have mixed feelings about this book but I guess the bottom line is that I enjoyed it and definitely will read the next installment.  It is NOT a standalone though, so if you haven't read part 1, be sure to read that first.  I like these two characters and I enjoyed the tortuous path they are going down, even though Layla's insecurities near the end are a bit much  (don't want to put in spoilers) and the plot, which had been interesting and different up to the 75% mark suddenly became a bit too ""traditional"" :  the author used plot devices which were old and overused, but still I was willing to overlook that because I liked the characters.  I wasn't able to read this book in one sitting and I was found myself thinking about these two and wondering where the author would take us next.  That in and of itself is a feat but it made the sudden series of cliches at the end a bit more of a let down.
That said, I do wish romance authors would quit writing books in installments.  If I had come across these books before the trilogy was complete I would never have finished them (or bought them.)  There is too much to read out there, we are not in the age of Dickens when installments--and waiting for them to come out -- were the way to go.  There was much less competition in the bookstores then.  If too much time passes between installments I forget the characters and by the time the next one comes out I've forgotten the characters, am no longer empathizing with their emotions and just don't care anymore.  A few romance authors have tried this format and I am NOT a fan and strictly stay away from them.

228,"I'm going to be brutally honest - I didn't have big expectations going into Eve. The synopsis doesn't tell you exactly what the terrible secret is that Eve discovers, but I had a sneaking suspicion that although it would be shocking, it wouldn't exactly be unexpected.

Having lower expectations is not always a bad thing, and I believe those lowered expectations helped me enjoy Eve much more than if it had been a book that I'd been eagerly awaiting - I'm going to call this a 'comfort dystopian' - it's fun (as dystopians go), easy-to-read and moves along at a fair pace.

Eve is incredibly naive, and at first that bugged me - I mean, really, you live in an all-girls-school and you think that when you graduate you're going to live a normal life? There was a virus that killed most of the human population, maybe you're being slightly unrealistic? But after a while, I ignored my irritations and just enjoyed the story. None of the characters are completely fleshed out, and there's a big dose of insta-love between Eve and Caleb, but none of the characters are completely irritating.

Ms. Carey has some interesting ideas for a dystopia, along with some disturbing ideas on how the world would repopulate itself after such a devastating virus, a megalomaniac ruler and how quickly humans can degenerate into some pretty shady characters. The world-building is a little lacking in history and explanation and Eve makes a pretty quick turn in her view of the world, but it forms a solid base.

I don't really know what else to say about Eve - it didn't blow me away, but it certainly didn't make me want to headbutt anyone either - I think my description of a comfort dystopian is quite appropriate for how I felt about the book, but it could be brilliant for a reader who isn't completely comfortable with the grittiness of some dystopian worlds.",1,"[0.4969643224248126, 0.9993414762786632, -1.3505061452222775, -1.0530795920459675, -2.209321029391372]",0.9993414762786632

274,"I love stories where the ""big girl"" finds love, so I expected to absolutely love this book.  Instead, it left me a little cold.  At one point about 1/3 of the way in I put it down to read something else for a week or so.  That is not a good sign for a romance!

The bottom line is that I didn't love the characters and didn't find their romance to be believable.  But a lot of things contributed to that feeling.  I'll try not to give spoilers along with my reasons.

First, I hated the passage near the beginning of the book where Logan has sex with his then-girlfriend.  I understand what the author was trying to show about his attitude toward relationships and what his girlfriend ""type"" was, but I don't want a detailed sex scene between the hero and another woman in my romances!  And I never really warmed up to Logan as a hero anyway. There was nothing to explain why he had such an aversion to commitment.  I also didn't buy into his ""I want her/no I don't want her"" phase when he was feeling physically attracted to Holly but kept telling himself he wasn't.

Chase and Amanda's little ""kink"" was distracting, then annoying and finally uncomfortable.  They are a big part of the plot but I didn't need that.  And I didn't believe that if Holly had only one close friend in high school and no friends in college, she'd make such a personality change as to become close friends with Amanda and then be so outgoing in some circumstances but still an emotional hot mess in others.  That inconsistency in the character's personality made it hard to really like her as a character.",1,"[0.492548615504665, 0.9978747384844682, -1.6147197402861262, -1.0630650206594683, -1.630260468984153]",0.9978747384844682

Wow. Just wow! That's my first thought after finishing this book. I loved Damien and Nikki and didn't think I could love anyone as much as them. Well, I was definitely WRONG! I loooooved Jackson and Sylvia. I enjoyed how Damien and Nikki overlapped in this book as well. They haven't been forgotten but they aren't the forefront of this book either. I enjoyed the combustible chemistry between Jackson and Sylvia and the sweetness too. The way J Kenner writes pulls you into their world and you feel like a part of it.

I was expecting something miraculous and wonderful.
It wasn't that.
It was a decent read.
The author is a fantastic storyteller and can write quite well.
The plot and characters is where it wasn't always great for me.
Vicious is an a-hole. A huge one throughout the book. I love alpha jerks. They are some of my favorites. Except he never made much sense as to why he was that way. And the 'vicious' things he did to this girl was unforgivable IMO. I'm all for revenge and alpha a-holes but they have to have a reason to be liked in the end... to make up for WHY they were the way they were. He didn't IMO have a legit reason aside from the fact he's just a Jerk and... even though she was defiant and funny and didn't take his crap. In the end she did and caved. I'd expected Hate Sex. Or More of a passion... plus better written sex as a whole. This book is not erotic in the least. The sex is tepid. I think if that part had been better I would have given the book 5 stars.
All in all it was an interesting read.
I think there wouldn't been more suspense had there only been 1 Pov.
I would recommend.

9431,"Boy, did I hate this movie:  it took me nearly 13 hours to get through it because I couldn't stand to watch more than 5-10 minutes at a time.

Mind you, I'm a Herzog fan!  I got this because I've been on quest for the last couple of years to collect all of his movies on DVD, something I believe as of this writing to be impossible (e.g., HERDSMEN OF THE SUN).

Herzog sure puts me off my feed:  I can swallow his arthouse films just fine; it's his more mainstream jobs that are over my head.

For example, what is he up to with this one, BAD LIEUTENANT?  While watching it, I had to check the DVD case a couple of times to ensure it was directed by Herzog, but no:  the iguana scenes, if nothing else, are his lion's paw.

On the surface it's a story of a corrupt cop in post-Katrina New Orleans who manages to get the job done even though nobody expects him to.  Haven't we seen this material before, and done much better?  The dialogue is forgettable, the lessons the script purports to inculcate are murky when not hackneyed, and the film doesn't render much of the flavor of life in New Orleans.  Worse, Nicholas Cage is not very convincing except in parts.

But seeing over 2 hours of this cop messing up his life and everybody else's life made for some pretty uncomfortable viewing.  Heck, I was able to watch longer chunks of EVEN DWARFS STARTED SMALL.

2186,"I chose this book because I loved the author's book, Killed At The Whim Of A Hat. Alas, the style of this book seems quite different. The characters weren't as strong and I had trouble paying attention.

The book opens well. A helicopter pilot has what seems to be a fatal crash. We first see the scene through the pilot's eyes, and then later we understand what really happened. This part is very well-done.

About 10 years later, Dr. Siri gets asked to form a search party to look for the missing pilot. He chooses a crew that includes his wife and assistants. The interpreter is an improbable, spritely missionary's daughter named Peach.

After the scene was set, I just couldn't get interested in the trek. The pace seemed slow, with lots of pauses for eating and drinking. Perhaps the author wants to convey the pace of life in Laos, which makes sense. This is the type of book I read for escape and pure fun and it didn't work.

However, I suspect it's a matter of taste. I hadn't read other books in the series; this one might not be typical.

6167,"Ahhh you know what its like when you fall in love with a group of people and just can barely stand it to wait on the next book? That is what it was like waiting for this book. It was nearly painful! Ive been thrilled with Damon Scott and lusting after his story since the beginning of The Pawn, Book 1 in the End Games trilogy, connected but not required reading for this book. I LOVE how all of these books have the same general type of covers minus The Prince not sure why he doesnt have the same type of cover but they are still some of the BEST books Ive read this year!

What I love the most from these books is you think Damon rules. He conquers all. People cower in the corner scared and fearing him. However, Penny is his weakness his Queen. Nothing is ever really as it seems with these two. Penny is strong, much stronger than I gave her credit for while reading Gabriel and Averys stories. Penny has buffed her copper and she is shining! Penny is an amazing character. You will route for her! You just cant help it shes an amazingly strong woman. No one else would better fit with Damon!

Skye Warren pulls you in with her words of poetry! Warren has this exquisite way with words and forming her characters. Its quite the gift to be able to write villains so relatable that you cant help but to route for them. You will definitely find yourself liking this group of characters. All of these books have flowed perfectly into each other you're left feeling somewhat satisfied at the endings but wanting more and not completely satisfied. If that isn't a writing gift, I don't know what is!

I mean ugly cry, but I also laughed and swooned.  Oh our hero Zeke, hmmmm Zeke you are the stuff right out of our fantasies.  Strong loving and protective.  Our heroine is Honor.  She has suffered a lot in her life.  Your heart breaks with all she goes through and not one time do I not feel that how Honor feels is not warranted.

As always I do not give away too much in my reviews I feel that you as the reader need to discover and fall in love with this book as I did, and that includes not giving away the book.

Great job Sarah!!

Though this one doesn't have the same sort of action as previous books, the intricate details and formidable characters still have you on the edge of your seats. You never know what's going to happen, and that's what I love about this series. Each book is completely different, new scenarios, new characters introduced. But this one also brought back a character we didn't think we'd ever hear from again. And my goodness, it was well written with a lot of thought and I could vision myself in every part of the book. It sucked me and and that end it spat me back out. I'm speechless because I know the next book is going to be EXPLOSIVE!

All it took was one kiss for the main characters' beautiful journey to begin and that was all it took for me to FALL for Beth & Reed.

Reed Fxcking Tennyson paints the picture of being this womanizer and manwhore but deep inside he's sweet, he's beautiful, he's caring and oh SWEET BABY JESUS don't get me started on his fxlthy, sexy as all hxll mouth. 'Cause hot damn... he melted my pxnties, my insides, my ovaries. Ugh.

I loved Reed in Where I Belong and All I Want, but it was just something about being inside his head. He hides his scars well and is someone who doesn't wear his emotions on his sleeve; so every thought, every emotion he felt BLEW MY MIND!

Beth Davis. Oh lord BETH! This woman by far is my favorite heroine from any of J's books. In all honesty, every one of her heroines are fierce, independent, bada$$ women! But Beth, ugh she has this sweetness to her yet she's still sassy, and she's a total minx, just as fxlthy as Reed lol. Her journey and her story was beautiful to watch and one that touched every part of my soul; for Beth Davis, from McGill's, is my SPIRIT ANIMAL.

This book will have your feels pulled in different directions. One moment you'll be laughing and the next crying. I must give it to J, for she knows how to use the secondary characters perfectly in a story making sure that they intertwine. And she does it in a way where you will never be able to forget them (Nolan!!!) for sure.

I was taken on a journey of self discovery and I loved every moment of it. From the smiles, to the texting, to Reed singing *sigh*. J, thank you for the Bama Boys; for my heart loves them all but Reed is on a whole other level. He's a rare breed... A mystical creature.

Mysteries set in the UK always feel comfortable for me - I was a fan of The Bill in it's heyday - and having been to the areas in the novel, albeit it as a visitor - the settings were familiar.

The pace was good, the plot was complicated but not hard to follow by any means, but the interaction between the police officers concerned me. There are some stereotypes in the cast which were a slight disappointment - for example, the prostitute, Ivy, was shown to be so awful in appearance that I wondered why even the most desperate of punters would deal with her. There is the mandatory black officer and the straightforward woman officer who assist the leading character.

Now for DCI Foster. She is not a likeable person and to a certain extent, she is a stereotype as well. Losing her husband in a police action, injured herself, off on sick leave - she is plunged into an investigation outside her jurisdiction for no discernible reason. Then she proceeds to buck the rules, get herself into trouble from her supervisor... all the usual ""police officer"" breaking the rules applies here.

It was her who caused them to be caught in in Compromising situation. They marry. Blah Blah Blah!! How many times have we seen this storyline play out. This story was Not Written Well. No depth and no backstory. The best part was Katherine's Aunt Havens and she was suffering from Dementia.

The story is not worth the price $3.99.",1,"[-1.3111056520069215, 0.9344266923374192, -1.786454177978849, -1.0917401125016875, -1.4103337704088428]",0.9344266923374192

1973,"Fire & Ice is the one I've been waiting for ever since I first picked up the first in the Wild at Heart series, and I wasn't disappointed!  While I dearly love both of the other sisters and their stories this is by far my favorite of them all (I feel such a kinship with Bailey the most out of all the Wilde Girls)!!!  Bailey and Gage's story is filled with as much humor, action, entertainment, and romance as I could ask for!  Danger once again lurks in the shadows causing these two and those loyal to them to draw nearer to each other and unearth the secret villain!  Finally secrets from Bailey's past a revealed and her heart is opened to healing!  And the more I learned about Gage's character the more I loved him!  I LOVE the way Mary writes and the correct details she adds to her stories!  Action, laughter, and adventure await you in this whole series, and it is one that I highly recommend!

Songs that I think go with Fire & Ice: ""Lift Your Head Weary Sinner (Chains)"" by Crowder, ""Not For A Moment (After All)"" by Meredith Andrews, and ""God Gave Me You"" performed by Blake Shelton
Songs etc. May be changed and/or added in the future. ~ASC
