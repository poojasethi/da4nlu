Caside and Anabelle have been promised to each other since birth, most arranged marriage's don't get off to a good start, but theirs is setting the sheets on fire. A dark wizard has cast a spell making him immortal until he kills every dragon alive.  Even though I thought it was mean of the dark wizard, but that is what helped to make for a good story.

In this case Sorcery  can be won over by love!  Can't wait to read more by Serena Rose.",2,"[-2.4943761735340657, -1.7174290862069612, 0.2863317048671857, -1.0307350664199493, 0.3531271675463302]",0.3531271675463302
4554,"Loves Every Whisper was beyond my expectations! I was swept into the first book of this series with excitement. This second book is even more intense and impressive. Unpredictable, fast paced, suspense filled drama exceeded even Love's Unfading Light. Characters from the first novel in the series flow into the second book with a familiarity that is authentic and remarkable.

Victoria is sought after by a wealthy man who is deceptive and pretentious. Her family has arranged for a marriage of convenience while she is attracted to another. She may be attracted to the fisherman who is known for his life saving enterprise, but family expectations override her interest in those beneath her class.

Shipwrecks are a common threat as Lake Superior's storms threaten the ships that travel the deadly waters. A life-saving team has been invaluable to the victims of these shipwrecks. Without that team the numbers of lost sailors and travelers would be overwhelming. The portrayal of shipwrecks and rescue endeavors are intense and descriptive. As a resident in the area the author is very familiar with the location and landmarks, as well as tragedies in the mines of the area and the shipwrecks of Eagle Harbor. That knowledge is a pivotal part of this novel.

I found this book to be one of the most exciting stories, revealing many layers of relationships, family dynamics, and the devotion of a man who values the lives of others above his own. I highly recommend this book!",2,"[-4.229145902890085, -1.5915318832051257, 0.2371995889736066, -1.0416387758039511, 0.35209331827216206]",0.35209331827216206

Hayden and Boone are so awesome together!
The story of longing and a love that can be had when the right person comes along.
Hayden is a tomboy, mostly encouraged and definitely demanded by her Parents. The wanted a boy, so they created the boy they wanted without regard of what they were doing to the woman inside.
Boone saw the woman inside immediately when Hayden takes a domestic violence call. Although it looked pretty cut and dry, Hayden saw something that wasn't right and went above the call and to Boone she became his savior.
This is a story of how we are shaped into the person we are today. The influences of other and our desire to not Rock the Boat with the people we love most. Problem is, is most of those we love the most can influence you in a direction you may not have taken if given the choose.
I so relate to Hayden and I am myself a tomboy. However I was encouraged to be who and what I wanted to be. I loved this story for the lessons we can learn from the entire story line.

Though a novel, with a protagonist named Raami, the book is more like a memoir of the author's life.  We learn of Raami's life of privilege before the invasion of the Khmer Rouge and her struggles and pain during the holocaust that killed close to two million people in Cambodia.  Ms. Ratner talks about Elie Wiesel's book, Night, being inspirational in her being able to find words to write this book.

Raami's life parallels the author's but she changes the number of people in her family along with their names.  The only one whose name stays true is her father's, a poet and lover of words who Raami worships.

This book is profoundly inspirational while not being cloying or maudlin at any time.

Simon has an interesting turn of fate in this book by becoming a vampire.  There are some close calls when Clary thinks she's lost Simon.  Also this love/attraction between Jace and Clary ventures on the lines of being sick; they are brother and sister after all.  But are they?

A new character is introduced in this book as well, a young werewolf Miaia.  Will something develop between Simon and Miaia?  Alec will also come very close to admitting to his parents his romance with Magnus.

I honestly found myself not wanting to stop reading until I finished the book and cannot wait to continue reading the series.
A friend of Stephen's lets him know that a slave is being mistreated.  Stephen is not into a 24/7 dominant/slave relationship, instead he prefers a dominant/submissive relationship.  Stephen purchases Brianna and saves her from a never ending abusive relationship and tries to help her heal.  Stephen falls in love with Brianna and dreams of a relationship with her but does not know if that will ever happen.

A short note was included about these two works, in case you haven't had the pleasure, in the beginning of this book. It was so very helpful for reminding me what had happened - as it had been some time since I read them.

Love conquers all, if we let it. Through various trials, three couples work out their love. Cara and Ephraim struggle with Cara's past, her father's reappearance, her fight to forgive and learn German and Pennsylvania Dutch. A year of mourning keeps Lena and Grey from revealing their burgeoning love. And Aaron and Sylvia struggle with heartbreak and addictions - physical, and emotional. Ms. Woodsmall takes us through these struggles, and more, as we watch each couple fight to win and overcome. We see their pain, feel their desperation, and rejoice when they triumph as love holds them fast.

I would highly recommend all three books in this series. Ms. Woodsmall grabs your attention and keeps it page after page. Enjoy!",4,"[-3.0740628048731393, -2.465991931472138, 0.3460245816567469, -1.0228087663957546, 0.12203952438568788]",0.3460245816567469
6409,"The Bennett family books have become my new favorite series. I love the large crazy family, the funny banter between siblings, and the way they always have each other's backs. Max's story is a perfect example of this.

Max and Emilia first met when they were 9 years old and quickly became best friends. They were separated four years later when Emilia and her grandmother moved away but they never forgot each other. Years later, Max needs physical therapy and meets Emilia again. They quickly forge a strong bond,, Emilia badly needs a friend and Max is eager to renew the friendship. This time grown up Max and Emilia have more than simple friendship on their minds but fight the attraction at first, afraid to mess up their relationship. Max has never wanted a commitment before and Emilia is carrying a ton of baggage from her past but their love is strong and they have the Bennett family on their side!

I loved Max. He was thoughtful and caring and went all in once he realized his feelings. Emilia held back because of her bad past experiences but no one can say no to Max Bennett for long! I loved their story and catching up with the other Bennetts! This story can be read by itself but I highly recommend reading all the stories....just because they are so good!

Everett is this man, from a broken past, that loves his BFF something fierce, but there is always something standing in his way of acting on his feelings... Insecurities and doubt are most of his issues.  Then you have Cameron who is this beautiful, stubborn and charming girl who loves and wishes for Everett to love her.

This book will cover the past and the present lives of Cameron and Everett. You will watch the missed opportunities these two had.  You will watch these two circle around each other and root for them to succeed.  Their story is not an easy story to read... it is emotionally draining.... but the pain, the misunderstandings, and the time lost will be all worth it when things finally come into place because that ending!!!

It's nice to be able to turn cherry pitting into an assembly-line operation and this pitter seems to do a good job (like I said, I have no experience with any other mechanical pitting device). The design of the unit is also very stylish, so it can be stored with my blenders and other paraphernalia and blend in well with the counter-top aesthetics - or, once washed and dried (don't grab the blade with your bare hands), it can be dis-assembled and stored in its box.

As most people have mentioned, slow and easy does the job, and it does not get all the pits all the time -- so be on the lookout. However, anything you buy already pitted (cherries, dates, etc) also comes with a similar disclaimer.

I want to see how long the blade can last -- and the price of replacement once the wear and tear gets to any part of the unit.

I have not tried it on olives, as one user did -- but I would think that it would also work well for small fruits cherry-sized, with pits.

As has been her niche with these wonderfully sexy books she has been treating us with, Most Valuable Playboy is in Cooper's POV. Lauren write's the male POV with incredible insight into her hero so you will never have a doubt as to what Cooper is feeling, thinking, or what his plans are. I for one love the male POV. I absolutely adore Cooper & Violet. Cooper is driven, gorgeous, charismatic, funny and sweet. He has also been 100% focused on football since he is finally the starting quarterback this season. Violet is adorable, sweet, smart and sexy and Cooper's best friend's sister. She is also one of his best friends.
Sometimes pretending can turn real in all the best ways. They have been friends forever, so when Cooper asks Violet to help him out of a jam she doesn't even hesitate at the chance to help. Their chemistry is through the roof! It isn't long before all of those pretend kisses and feelings turn into something so special there is just no way not to give into it and just let it happen and see where it will take them.
This book will make you happy, make you smile and make you believe in love.
Full of fun, humor, sweetness, surprises and of course steamy heat; this is another incredibly enjoyable must read by this amazing lady.",2,"[-3.8296763064656747, -2.9771942728896397, -0.05771472447666226, -1.0473043344103579, 0.3423165216270704]",0.3423165216270704

5566,"K.A. Linde's book boyfriends are some of my favourite. Not because they are sexy as all get out- they so are. It's not because they can make fire between the sheets- they so can. Linde creates book boys who are strong males, well educated, confident, charismatic and ambitious. She does the exact thing with her female characters. This combo makes for a storyline that is passionate, sexy, intense and hotter than hot. The chemistry between her characters is almost tangible and jumps from the pages. Jenson Wright is no different. I adored his charm that was veiled by his cocky CEO persona.
I enjoyed the storyline of The Wright Brother as the characters were a bit older and at different stages of their lives than her other books' characters. I can't wait to read about the other brothers Landon and Austin.
This was a quick read, with a little bit of angst, a little bit of humor a whole lot of sexy and a whole lot of classic K.A. Linde style.

by Sedona Venez

Arrrrrgggg!!!!

Ok...I am better now.

Love Ryker and Lightning. As well as the other pack members. I can see more stories coming up.

When Lightning Strikes has a very alpha male wolf-shifter. Ryker is the kind of guy I would have loved to meet....in my younger days. ;-)  He is all about protecting those that he loves. Knows what he wants and he wants Lightning.

Lightning is the type of woman I wish I had been. So full of sass, very independent, and no holds barred wild woman. Will do anything for the ones she loves. But, she just doesn't do lasting relationships. Love em' and Leave em'. Until Ryker. She fights that attraction all the way. How long can she hold out and does she really want to? Time will tell.

One spoiler.....there is a cliff hanger.....Arrrrgggg!!!!

Can't wait for ""Reason to Love"" comes out.

  I have really enjoyed this series so far I love the crazy quirky of at least one of if not more then one character in each book it really sums up the small town of Cherry lake. I think is this book the only thing I had a hard time with was it dragged a little bit and seemed whiney sometimes. Over all I loved the story and it flowed well, , the slowness is really not that bad and it seems to be towards the beginning for only a few pages I would give this book a 3.5 star almost a four because of that. If you have enjoyed the other books in the series then you won't regret grabbing this one and following the fun characters through all of Cherry Lake.

9807,"I use parchment sheets constantly, for everything from baking to lining pans for broiling meat and nachos--pretty much any time I use a baking sheet that's not a muffin pan--plus wrapping dough or cheese, etc.. I switched to sheets from rolls a few years ago when Costo switched to a substandard supplier, and have been well pleased--I was always cutting the sheets the wrong size, or tearing a corner, or struggling while they rolled up on me. My go-to sheets are these commercial ones (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C7KU4V6)--cheap, flat (not folded), and excellent even in long roast a very hot oven or a moderate trip under the broiler. But some people might not have a kitchen with enough storage space for the giant box of 1000 (size of a half sheet pan, but 5"" thick), or may not need parchment enough to ever use 1000 (I use them a LOT and still have almost half a box 2 years in). In that case, I'd highly recommend these over rolls.

While not as convenient anf foolproof as flat pack, the folded sheets don't fight you too much, and the nonstick quality may be even a hair better than my commercial sheets. The box is tiny, only 1/4 the size of a half sheet pan and less than an inch thick, very easy to find a home for. And iy you use a quaryer sheet pan (toaster oven size) a lot, the folds are actually nice, because they make the sheets easy to tear in half.

The lantern is easy to use. Unscrew the bottom to install 3 AA batteries (not included) and it's ready to go. Unfold the handles, pull up the top and you have a nice bright LED light. Pull it up just a tiny bit and you have a muted light that would work for moving around in the tent when you don't want to disturb anyone. The light shines through the camo print and gives a nightlight effect. Another nice feature that the  lantern has is a compass on the top. Perfect for those times when you might need to know where you are or need to find your way back.

I do love the Eltronica Camo Lantern. The only thing that would make it better would be a shield on one side to mute the light so it doesn't shine in your eyes and a glow in the dark compass. Outside of that, this little lantern is just about perfect!

Then one night, he just grabbed the microphone in Seduction, and was lured into his old love. It didn't hurt that he gets to work with a woman who makes him feel alive again.

Addison has been burned before  by bad boys who are musicians. There was no way she was going to risk her heart once again. Not especially with someone who was as famous as Jake, and whos face adorned the posters on her walls growing up.

If Jake was really determined to have Addison, Addison was fighting tooth and nail to resist him. If you read Jake, and how he tries to woo and tease her, youd know this wasn't an easy feat. Just as she was lowering his walls, Jakes past caught up with him.

Will both of them be able to let go of their past and take a risk for their future?

In the back of the Bible, you will find some awesome resources such as a Christian Worker's Resource, the Bible book-by-book, dictionary/concordance and maps all in full color.

The Life Application notes are ideal for learning how to apply Scripture to your life.  With the historical and cultural background included among the pages of Scripture, you will be better equipped to see how even though the times are different, we are still human beings with the same needs and problems as the ones encountered during biblical times.

Reading the Bible using the Chronological Life Application Study Bible will make Bible study easier with its one-book approach to studying the Bible for yourself.  You won't have to use several different books.  Now, you can use the resources provided in the Chronological Life Application Study Bible.

I am thrilled with Tyndale's new Bible and look forward to reading the Bible and studying the notes and features of the Chronological Life Application Study Bible in 2014.

Such an intense read! I haven't read Raven and Declan's story, but I got intrigued by Salvation's blurb and wanted to start with this. It was a good decision, Salvation told some of the events from the previous books, and it was perfectly understandable as a standalone.

I'm not much of an angst kind of girl, but sometimes it's good to ride a good emotional roller coaster and hold on for dear life.

Salvation tells the story of a wounded ex soldier and an emotionally abused, but sweet and innocent young woman. They have an instant and intense connection the first time they meet, but Robbie tries to deny it and distances himself from Ember. But after a few weeks, he fails miserably and can't stay away from her.

They are just what the other needs, Robbie is really protective and possessive of Ember, and she feels completely safe with him. Ember can calm Robbie's demons like no one else. They bring some much needed peace to their significant other's life, and they are happier together than ever.

But the demons from Ember's past refuse to stay in the past, and they have to face them together if they want to bury them once and for all...

I loved to get to know the whole gang, they are a tight knit, and they always have each other's back. Robbie and Ember are really lucky to have such an intense support system behind them.

There was one person in particular who really has my attention from the group, so the last few sentences are just about killed me.

Abby has moved back home with her parents and divorced sister to help raise her nephew and lick her wounds from a horrible breakup.  Little did they know that they would be thrown together and that it would help both of them heal and grow.  I think this story was so well written.  The Harrison family was so intense and each have their own things going on, but when the chips are down you find out how they really feel about each other.  Abby's family was amazing and the way family should be.  The chemistry and heat between Pierce and Abby was intense and some of the scenes will have you reaching for ice because they are sooooo hot!

* the stand and angled tip allows me to place the baster on my counter without spills or drips;
* all the parts of dishwasher safe (top shelf);
* soft bulb makes it easy to squeeze the drippings over the turkey;
* clear measurement markings make it a snap to measure broth for gravy;
* removable tip makes clean-up a snap (just be sure to remove the tape holding the tip to the main part of the baster because it's not easy to see the tape -- yeah, I tried to remove the tip before noticing the tape);
* the cleaning brush is included and makes clean-up a snap.

Mousse is an accurate description but it is more like the stiff texture of chocolate mousse that has sat in the bowl awhile.  Lots of air bubbles when you squeeze it out.  I mashed it around with my finger to get the texture more even to put on my face.

I dabbed it in little spots across my face and then smoothed it across my skin with a sponge that is Target's version of a Beauty Blender.  I have also spread it across my face with my fingers though that doesn't give me as even a coverage as the sponge.  I prefer a sheer coverage so I spread it fairly thin.  It does give a matte finish  For actual foundation is is pretty much OK.  I think one could put it on much thicker than I did and it would give fuller coverage.  The product itself is a little thicker than I am used to so I don't know how it would apply with a makeup brush.

Fearing certain death and the loss of their race, they sent nine Guarde (those with Legacies) to Earth.  These nine were accompanied by their Cepan (keepers) to help teach them and hone their skills once their Legacies (powers) presented.  The nine are the only hope of Lorien's future.  Once they gain their powers, they will be strong enough to defeat the Mogadorians and return to help rebuild Lorien.

An enchantment was put on the nine upon their departure from Lorien.  As long as they stay separate, they can only be killed in order.  When one of them dies, a scar is burned into the flesh of all the remaining.  John Smith just got his third scar.  He is number four.  They will come for him next.  John and Henri (his Cepan) are constantly on the run moving from one small town to another.  They have to keep one step ahead of the Mogadorians or face death.  They must constantly change their identities and keep a low profile so no one suspects where they are; that's easier said than done when you're in high school in a small town and you have super powers.

This was a fun read.  It sounds like there are great possibilities with John's story and the rest of the nine.  There are any number of Legacies that they could present with which could make for great stories.

She is homeschooled and has been educated in music. She entertained men for years with her singining.  As her 18th birthday arrives she realizes what being 'owned' means.  She escapes.

2908,"My Thoughts : When I see a new book by Deborah Raney, I already know that it is going to be a heartwarming tale , well written and filled with meaning. This book was certainly no disappointment. Deborah once again wrote a small town story, including warmth and humor.

The characters, at once, became part of me and I easily identified with the heartaches, problems, failures, challenges and joys. I actually became part of the Whitman family for a short time. Each has a unique personality and faces their life head on, in their own way, some bravely and others with regret. These people are just as we are, with their flaws  and all. Deborah has a message in her book that comes through loud and clear. God is the ONLY one who can give us unconditional love and will never leave us. You find yourself  wanting to sit these people down, sometimes to throttle them and give them a serious talking to!!Although as in real situations, some would respond positively to advice and others would not!

The plot was thorough , well developed and kept me entranced from the beginning to end. It was one that held some surprises, but at the same time, gave me a good dose of reality and the need for allowing God to take over your life and live HIS plans , not your own.

This was definitely a five star book!! Am looking forward for the next book by this talented author!",4,"[-3.159725885692086, -2.193313544727671, 0.3205778743567768, -1.041199695425506, 0.10864674917741224]",0.3205778743567768
838,"This book returns to the same universe as the excellent OLD MAN'S WAR.  We follow the adventures of Special Forces (aka the Ghost Brigades) soldier, Jared Dirac who was created as a clone of Charles Boutin, a scientist and traitor to mankind.  Boutin has gone over to one of the Colonial Defense Forces many enemies with enough information to cause no end of trouble.  To try and find out what he's doing and why, the CDF tries the long-shot of creating his clone and downloading Boutin's brain-scans.  Clones can be legally created from the deceased, and Boutin, having faked his death by killing a clone he'd created, is legally dead.  Such clones are meant to be enhanced Special Forces, who are awakened as full adults, aided by the computers (Brain-Pals) in their heads.  Unfortunately, Jared shows no sign of Boutin's memories, so he's assigned to combat.  But there's always the chance that those memories will arise, and those who know about Jared fear that they may have just created another traitor.

The previous book followed the training and missions of a ""normal"" trooper with the CDF.  This book reveals more about the strange Ghost Brigades who were introduced in the first book, and also features the return of Jane Sagan, the Special Forces officer who was John Perry's interest in the first book.  Reading the first book is not strictly necessary but is recommended to fill in the background of this universe (plus the fact that it's well worth the read).

Boutin's plot to help the Colonial Union's alien enemies band together, and to probably plan some sort of major sabotage he's capable of as a key scientist working with the CDF, is suspenseful.  The CU and CDF were already constantly in a state of war, but this combination is guaranteed to be ugly.  Seeing life through Jared Dirac's eyes as a clone that needs to function from day one and goes through training in two weeks is also fascinating.  His situation, as a clone who might, totally unknown to him, turn into a mirror of Boutin and betray his comrades and humankind, is also intriguing.

I have no hesitation in recommending this book to SF readers and fans of military SF.  I'll look forward to reading Scalzi's next books.",2,"[0.32042902241058546, -0.9275213972218477, 0.19355081996229678, -1.0316319258392772, -0.6336857372287248]",0.32042902241058546

211,"...""The Internet"" (as most of us have come to understand its popular rise in our consciousness over a generation) has been described with many metaphors: clouds, tubes, webs (as well as Arthur C. Clark's broad category of magic for any sufficiently advanced technology).

""Tubes"" doesn't really create new ground in sustaining or refuting any of these concepts. Instead, it captures the physicality behind the magic that delivers all those digital pieces to us through and examination of how the physical layer of the Internet grew.

After a squirrel-induced outage at at his Brooklyn home, Andrew Blum set out to expand the trace of wires behind his furniture, and see where all that data came from. The result of his findings are here, and he presents us with insider looks at the following:
-The physical parts of the network that grew by chance in its early days
-The physical parts of the network that grew by design as it matured
-The physical parts of the network where data moves and where data rests.

The results: detailed descriptions of the large centers where the connections of large backbone providers intersect and move data, tours of some of the places where undersea cables emerge from the depths to tie continents together digitally, and visits to the one of the factory analogs of the Information Age: the data centers that some increasingly trust more than they trust their own local storage options.

I've had my own experiences visiting facilities like these, and it's quite an accomplishment to get a book-length treatment of them. How much can you write about servers, switches, hubs, routers and cable runs? As it turns out, a lot, and Blum does so in an engaging and accessible way.

This book may not appeal to the general reader, but it will appeal to those who appreciate the kind of infrastructure we often take for granted. If you appreciate modern roads, modern sewage systems, clean drinking water delivered to your tap and a reliable supply of electricity --and have more than a passing interest in how any of these things became available to us-- then you will probably enjoy this book.

I can assure you that this book will suck you right in from the moment you start reading.

Marni Mann has become one of my go to authors because her books have slowly started to ingrain themselves in me. I just breeze through her books because they will capture your attention from the beginning and have it till the end.

This is going to be a favorite series of stand alones for me because these are about 4 best friends who own their agency and represent from top actors, models and athletes and I need to know how their personal lives will evolve with the rich and famous they represent and/or fall in love with.

Jack has had his eye on Samantha since the moment since the top pick for the NFL became his client and this client so happens to be Sam's brother, who he knows is definitely a no-no because you can't mix business with pleasure and/or screw up your first major contract with your top athlete.

When things don't work out between Sam and Jack, they both move on and become very successful in their respective jobs. But when Sam's brother is about to win the Super Bowl, she has no choice but to attend his game, even though she's been avoiding them for the exact same reason of not wanting to bump into Jack. But it's inevitable and it was bound to happen and it did after 8 years of not seeing each other.

Jack is instantly drawn to Sam and remembers ever curb and every spot on her body that was hard to forget to begin with and he hopes that they can rekindle what they left behind 8 years ago.

Sam has a secret that she doesn't want revealed. What will happen when Jack finds out??

Eventually she can't say no, right? And of course it's amazingly hot! I'm an angst-whore and this one had plenty of that! Fair warning this does end in a cliffhanger....I don't mind a cliffhanger as long as I'm not waiting years for the rest of he series.

(We have had pretty good luck with other Yeowww! toys, as well.)  Based on their reactions, I would say the catnip was fresh.  Also, and this is unusual, but my cats remained interested in this for at least several days after I gave it to them.  So that is a plus.

These are on the large side for cat toys that my cats will actually play with (there are larger cat toys out there, but my cats don't take much of an interest in those).  They're just long enough that a cat can dig his/her back claws in as well as the front claws and/or teeth.  They are light enough for larger cats to toss around, as well.

These are basically well-made.  There is rather a lot of embroidery on the side and some thread was loose from that when mine arrived.  I just nipped it off and no more has come loose.  Plus my cats haven't managed to rip any seams or make any puncture holes in this so far.

""It's my last tie to the life I'm trying to leave behind, the last vestige of a man who for five years covered me with shiny things while trying his da*mdest to dull my sparkle.""

Meredith is a smart hard working woman who has been underestimated and judged by those around her. She was thought to be just a trophy wife, and to see her grow and how determined she was warmed heart! I felt like the odds were stacked against her from the beginning.

Oh sweet misunderstood, Jack. This man. He was scared and didn't even know it. Everyone walked around on eggshells because he was... well. An Arrogant Devil. He was harsh and at times jealous without realizing it and I freaking loved it. I LOVE seeing men brought to their knees with love for a woman.

For every time my heart broke or swooned for Jack his grandmother, Edith had me giggling or smiling with pride. You see, I'm a Texan, and when Edith brought up the taunt, ""Come and Take It."" I was beaming with pride! I know that line may not resonate with every reader, but dang it. I'm from Texas and this makes me so proud!

I love this book. It is perfect for me. A couple people said there is too much drawing and not enough journaling. Well, for someone like me -its perfect. I am not a ""journaler"". I can't ever think of anything to write and usually don't have the time. I always start out with good intentions... but after a few pages (literally) I give up, forget about it, and never open the journal again.

So if you have thought about starting a prayer or praise journal but are not really a writer or just don't have a lot of time - like me, this book will be great for you! It has gorgeous pictures/drawings that you can color as much or as little as you want. And there is just enough open ended thoughts and questions to get you thinking and writing a few words. AND - its fun!!!!
What I like to do is color in a few small spots then use that same color to write a few words. So I end up with a pretty picture and pretty colorful writing!

3875,"I absolutely love this gratitude journal! The first thing that caught my eye is the beautiful cover that is extra thick so you can carry it in your bag without worry of the cover getting crinkled or damaged. It also helps to lie the book flat while you're working inside.

The greatest thing about this journal is the heavy paper they used inside! I was actually able to use my paints inside this book without it damaging the paper! Now, obviously, you wouldn't want to overuse the water but I used my watercolors and my acrylics inside the pages and they worked beautifully!  I really loved this because I don't always want to use colored pencils but in so many coloring books, the pages will only accept the pencil.

Here's a couple pages from the inside of my book. This is when I first started coloring in the book. You can see I colored in the little motor scooter, the word ""friends"" and the little pretty scroll at the bottom of the second page. Don't you love all the space to write? The book is like this throughout. There are beautiful Scriptures and devotional type writings that guide you as you use the book, as well.

The book is so very beautiful even without being colored in! They put so much extra thought into this little book and it has become a part of my quiet time. I use it to write my prayer, my thought, my blessings and more! As I color in the pages, I pray for my family and friends. It's such a relaxing thing and really helps you focus on the Lord and your prayers.

I love this book! I have never had such a gorgeous journal that allows me to express myself with so many different methods of pencil, paint and brush. You can really get creative and make this book your own! I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys coloring, writing, and journaling. I give this 5 out of 5 stars.

Tenny follows Dom to Seattle when he is drafted there and becomes his PA. While doing that she gets two degrees and is still in love with Dom (secretly) but keeps having her life circle around him.

This was another great book by KC Lynn!!! I love this series and the characters!!! I LOVE these SEALs and what they stand for!!! Graces story is heartbreaking. She not only lost her mother but she lost her in such a horrible, horrible way. She wholeheartedly loved her mother with her entire soul and when she was killed a part of Grace died too. Then to make matters worse she was sent to live with her uncle who she described as the devil which should tell you what you need to know about him. She overcame a lot and deserved her HEA!!!

I am glad it was Sawyer she was destined to be with because he is the funny lighthearted one out of the bunch. The joker. However he lost some points with me by doing what he did in the beginning . And all because of a bruised ego. I feel he really betrayed Grace by not only hooking up with someone but that someone be Graces worst enemy. They were not dating so technically he didn't cheat but I still was ticked off about it. It was hard for me to move past it and I think Grace forgave him too quickly. Another thing that ticked me off about him was when he and Grace went to visit his parents and they went to the bar he left her in a booth by herself for 45 minutes. He was way too wrapped up in his self to notice. But I had to cut him a little slack because he wasn't used to the girlfriend thing. Its for these reasons I gave this book 4.5 stars instead of five. However Sawyer really redeemed himself at the end by making Graces (and her moms) dreams come true!!! It doesnt excuse his earlier behavior in my eyes but it sure as hell gains most of his lost points back!!! After all everyone f***s up.

This book kind of leaves you hanging but not with Sawyer and Graces story. Lets just say if you haven't downloaded Cades book then you need to go ahead and do so!!!

I loved this book! Ella is a kick b*tt girl who is the exterminator of her town. She takes out zombies with her dads katana.

I loved the character of Seth deMage - the Duke of Leithfield. I loved the chemistry between him and Ella! Of course I couldn't stand the evil step mother!  But what goes around comes around =)

Also the cover of this book is gorgeous!

An excellent retelling of Cinderella with zombies =)

Happy Reading!

The idea of My Monopoly while interesting is poorly executed. Rather than include software in the box, users are required to use an app from the Apple App Store  or for Android from Google play. In lieu of that you are referred to www.mymonopoly.com.  The website www.mymonopoly.com is merely an ad for the product featuring a link for where to buy it. Eventually I discovered another site

2564,"Appetite of Envy by Amabel Daniels is another book in her Newland siblings series. After having read Better Than the Best about Kelly Newland and Will Parker, I was looking forward to her older brothers story and she did not disappoint! It is a contemporary romance peppered with some suspense that keeps you on your toes!
Appetite of Envy is the story of Finn Newland and Lia Gardella. Finn has worked for Lias dad since he was 15 years old and he knows that he wants to do nothing but run Gardellas until he breaths  making food is his passion! Lia has not set a step into her fathers restaurant for 10 years since she set fire to it, accidentally of course as she is one of the klutziest persons I have read about! At the same time she was also one of the most lovable persons I have read about .
The writer is taking us on a suspenseful rollercoaster of emotions, pranks, hidden threats  and love  love that conquers all and love that once you acknowledge it, will open up a world where you feel that you can do anything if that other person is there for you  that other person becomes your home and nothing, nothing can go wrong (even if it actually does but your perspective on it is different).
I love the Newland family and I am looking forward to reading about the other brothers! I hope that the writer will not keep us too long in suspense! I am sure she has many amazing stories to share with us!",4,"[-3.454921223805533, -2.2417239958764794, 0.29943520310616334, -1.007367033766203, -0.11963071385989321]",0.29943520310616334
2412,"I am in love.  This book was amazing.  I would even go as far as to say that it was one of the best books that I read this year.

Isabeau was a musical prodigy.  At the age of 5, her abilities as a concert pianist came in to play, and her mother made sure that she was given every opportunity in the world to advance her talents.  They would travel for the next five years, with Isabeau playing the piano to sold out concert halls, wowing audiences and making a name for herself.  When a car accident takes the life of her mother and leaves Isabeau critically injured and fighting for her life, however, Isabeau's love for the piano dies as well.

At 25, Isabeau is living in New York City, running a small, yet popular bar.  She has established a daily routine to her life and keeping herself from getting close to anyone.  She is very guarded and determined to keep her life simple.  When Noah, the incredibly sexy lead singer of the famous Black Phoenix band walks into her bar, however, Isabeau finds her life turned upside down and her simple life of monotonous day to day living is shaken up beyond anything she could have ever imagined.  Noah fights to win Isabeau's affection, and tries to prove to her that the music she left behind is the key to finally finding peace and happiness.

Oh my gosh, this romance is wonderful.  From the moment Isabeau and Noah meet, the sexual tension is thick enough to cut with a knife.  Every single emotion that the characters feel is intense and felt deeply.  It's powerful, beautiful, and raw.  The characters themselves are so exquisitely flawed.  The plot is played out wonderfully, and when the last page is read, you'll want to start again, just so you don't have to say goodbye.  I am not the type of person who rereads books often, but this is one I could and will probably read again and again.",4,"[-2.1031864569186354, -2.917319965017016, 0.2992852845323528, -1.0335960541427573, 0.20791529407217635]",0.2992852845323528

367,"This was an exciting read! There was one heck of an start to this story that immediately pulled me in. I had so much fun getting caught up in all the emotion and drama. Awesome story and excellent introduction to a new series.

Dare and Haven are fantastic! I loved - I mean LOVED - watching Haven really grow and come into her own. So shy and timid in the beginning from her upbringing to a strong, confident women. I really liked Dare and loved watching him battle the conflict he had going on in his head. He was so protective and caring, trying to do the right thing. These two together, with their extreme attraction, but trying to stay apart because of circumstances made for this great push and pull of want and need. The more they fought it, the more that attraction grew. And then bam. Wow! Seriously hot connection! It was more than hot sex though, there was this underlying emotion of trust and vulnerability happening that really pulled me into what the characters were feeling. It was fantastic!

Love the MC dynamic the author has set up and what the Raven Riders stand for. Great introduction of the brothers in the MC making me excited to get to know more and to read their stories. I really liked Havens friend Cora and am hoping she gets her own story at some point because there were a few foreshadowing hints that make me think there is a lot more going on with her than meets the eye. I adore the fact that the men of Hard Ink came into play. How they were woven in was perfect. Loved that.

I was invested the entire time. Seriously great writing. Loved the development and build. Fantastic details. Laura Kaye always paints a great picture, like a movie playing in my head. From the emotion to the hotness, a nice amount of drama and a bit of playfulness with an action packed ending, this was a FANTASTIC read.

Graham is the businessman, working long hours and taking care of his entire family. It's his job and he wants to do it. He takes it very seriously, always maintaining his focus and ordered life.

Mallory is a hard worker who takes pride in her achievements, good and small. She is disorganized and messy, but loves her job, taking care of whatever the Landry men need; Graham, Ford, Mr. Landry.

He is fascinated by her and she is attracted to him. She taunts him and he succumbs. Office sex so hot you'll need a quick trip to right yourself! He's the boss in all things. She takes care of him at all times. But how will this work when she wants more and he is going to deny himself?

Life gets chaotic for Graham and he has no idea how to handle it. Mallory knows she wants more than he will give her, and he's been honest about it.

The Landry family always has something going on. Fun, family, excitement and Linc's wedding to Dani. Being surrounded by family and love can change perspectives and open eyes.

The epilogue had me swooning.

Each story in the Landry series gets better and better. Ford's story should be epic! And when Camilla gets hers?

She is so beautiful that beating them off with a stick isn't going to cut it when shes older.  Peter and I are going to have to keep her in a smooth-sided cloud-high tower surrounded by a team of elite ninjas.

Mommy!  Come and wipe my butt!  Knowing better than to ignore a demand when Violets wearing the tiara, I race to the bathroom to find her in downward dog, bottom offered toward the sky.  Theres poop on the seat, the sink, her butt, her hands, the floor; I think I even see some on one of the pink bits of the tiara.

Like Im going to return to that library ever again.  Even if the zombie apocalypse was upon us and the library was the only fortified structure in town, Id rather risk my entire family becoming zombie hamburgers than enter through those swinging doors ever again.  Time for Twos and I are done.

That was almost a decade ago.  Somehow seems longer.  Actually, it counts as about half a century when you factor in parenting years.  Parenting years, of course, being like dog years: you just age faster.

Besides, the fact that I flat-out fail the pencil test these days is reason enough to conceal my body from anyone who isn't legally contracted not to run away from it.

My Review:

As the breadwinner of the family, when Amy lost her job the whole family went off the rails.  She was forced to become acquainted with her demanding, precocious, and manipulative pre-school aged children and discovers that she is completely lacking in parenting skills.  Her early attempts were lame and abysmal at best - before she gave up and gave in.  I smirked, snorted, laughed aloud, and snickered as a read this mirth filled missive of a clueless career woman coming face to face with her prickly, lazy, irresponsible, and tantrum-prone family -  and I mean all of them were obnoxious the majority of the time, Amy and husband in particular - but then, we all have our moments.  As the stress of being at home and without income continues to mount, Amy becomes more and more desperate and impulsively makes risky decisions and many missteps that could be the end of everything or a new beginning.  Ms. Frankens writing was wickedly witty, clever, and stealthfully insightful.",4,"[-2.3698409776132823, -2.3574171660847094, 0.2952682714816518, -1.0288537381409302, -0.028671244694164932]",0.2952682714816518
7278,"This is the second book in the Rosewood Bay series and I really loved everything about this book. It's second chances, single parents and when it's all said and done, a forever love neither Jake or Phoebe thought they'd find...again!

Both Jake and Phoebe grew up in the foster system and both are determined to prove that they're so much more than their troubled backgrounds. They fell in love as children with consequences that last a lifetime. Jake is strong and intelligent and while his marriage may have failed, he's a spectacular dad! And Phoebe, she's a strong and independent woman that will do anything she can for her little boy. She never thought she'd see his father again...until that fateful day they're working on the same project.

The beginnings of new love spark for two couples in this story, tempered by the separation of war  be it by deployment or internment  but allowing the power of the written word to fan the hearts spark into a steady and enduring flame is truly the stuff of great romance! My favorite of the Edwardian Brides series, A Refuge at Highland Hall is best appreciated if read in context (the characters!!) though it can also be read as a standalone. Speaking of characters, the Ramseys and the Fosters and those in their household (servants and friends) will carve out a spot in your heart, and though this farewell is bittersweet it is also sweetly satisfying.  If you enjoyed Kate Breslins Not By Sight or Pepper Bashams Penned In Time series  or if you're still mourning the loss of Downton Abbey, you will find a refuge in Carrie Turanskys Edwardian Brides series as well!

808,"I'm sure I don't need to give a lengthy reason as to why I love this book, as so many others already know what's so great about it! But I'll tell you why anyways! I first read Harry Potter years ago...probably pretty close to when it came out. I'll admit, when it first came out, I couldn't get into it; there was just something about a cat changing into a person that I couldn't get past. But then my family and I took a vacation to Colorado; a road trip, to be more exact, so I had a lot of time to read. I read the first three books on this trip and remember stopping at a books store while still in CO to pick up the Goblet of Fire! Since that time, I was hooked.

These books are about so much more than just a magical world with good guys and bad guys, and Harry always finding himself in the middle. It's about friendship, family and love. I feel like every time I read these books, I learn a little bit more about this. The friendship that Harry, Ron and Hermione have is so great! They have their ups and downs, and get into arguments. But they always find a way to patch things up and grow from their experiences. I guess this applies to the entire series, but I love the first book because we're learning along with these three friends what Hogwarts is all about and what it means to live in this magical world. It's a fun and entertaining book that is very well written. It may have been intended for children/teenagers, but there's no surprise why it appeals to people of all ages.

He has longed to have Maggie since they were young and he does not plan on letting her slip through his fingers again. Painful pasts and the lack of communication may end it all before Maggie and Tucker even get the chance to enjoy it.

Emotions run wild in this story. Tucker and Maggie are wonderful together but each one has their secrets that they want to keep hidden and no matter how close they get those secrets pull them apart. I loved watching Maggie's reactions to Tucker. She has finally found what she longs for but can she trust Tucker with her heart? The pain that they both hide only ends up blowing the bond that they have barely begun to make to bits. Seeing the pain that Maggie and Tucker go through pulls at your heartstrings and you can only hope that they will see their mistakes before it is too late for them.

I am a big fan of this author and series and cannot wait to see how this story continues in the next book. Not only did we get to see Maggie and Tucker fight for their love but we also got a glimpse at some past characters and I hope that we get to read Mason's story and find out more about everyone's past.

The author suggests that we can pose as a friend to gain trust
and information. This can have positive consequences; however,
it can backfire as a strategy. The idea that absence can increase
respect is interesting. If we are having an important beneficial
impact on an organization,  our absence will surface holes in
the throughput of productivity. As a consequence, management
will perceive value in the absence of a valuable employee
until his/her return. The author suggests that we should
concentrate force for maximum value. This can be beneficial;
however, the tactic can backfire if the group perceives that
it is being manipulated for personal gain. The maxim ""to learn
when to stop"" is important. There are times when less is better.

There are other personal qualities enunciated in this work.
These qualities are as follows:
- nonchalance or unobviousness in execution/implementation
- flattery will get you everywhere
- do not be the bearer of bad news
- be frugal in asking favors of superiors
- master your emotions
- become a source of pleasure rather than a burden

2 years have passed. The Shade and residents have had a nice break from all the drama and turmoil. We see marriages, babies and harmony bloom all around. TSL (The Shadow League) is now Gasp (Global Agency for Supernatural Protection) and they have things finally going good!! Will this last? Well you'll need to read to find that one out!

It has been nice seeing the Shade grow and also hold onto humanity at the same time. Seeing the human kids of everyone has been a nice treat! It always leaves some mystery of if they'll remain human, turn vamp or have someone force something on them.

The Murkbeech Adventures..... Turns out to be one adventure indeed. Leaving The Shade as a human isn't a smart idea at all!!

7869,"The Ozera Ice Pop Molds arrived well packaged. The package itself is attractive, with excellent directions on the side. The directions give info on how to fill the pops, place them in the mold and how to remove them from the tray. They are easy to clean in the dishwasher or by hand. The stand is convenient for holding the ice pops. The ice pops went over very well with my granddaughter.

I use two recipes, the first I found in Huffington Post:

Ice pops: These offer more thirst-quenching appeal. Combine fruit and juice to make ice pops. Simply blend together 1 cup of 100 percent juice (try mixing varieties, such as pineapple, orange, and cranberry) with 1 cup of fruit chunks (say, peaches, mango, or strawberries). Pour into pop molds and freeze for four hours. The fruit and juices provide re-energizing carbohydrates, potassium, and an array of antioxidants. Best of all? There's no added sugar in these homemade pops, so they contain fewer calories.

The next recipe came from allrecipes, and contain yogurt.

For frozen fruit and yogurt popsicles
4 (8-oz) containers of yogurt
1 (12-oz) bag frozen mixed berries
2 tablespoons honey
Make frozen fruit and yogurt popsicles
In a blender, whizz the yogurt, berries, and honey until smooth. Pour into the popsicle molds. Press on the lids and transfer to the freezer overnight
This might make more than is needed for the 6 ice pop molds, so you may need to adjust your ingredients.

These ice pop molds are such a great idea. The ice pops you purchase in the grocery store are all sugar. Now,you know what your child is getting. This product was provided for use and review.

1970,"I am a HUGE fan of Karen, and this just makes me love her books even more! :)  She weaves Faith and Love so beautifully!!!!  Heart on the Line is really two love stories in one, and I think I enjoyed the second characters story even more than Grace's!  From the beginning Karen grabs your attention as she sets the stage.  Then she proceeds to develop some of the most lovable and entertaining characters you will ever find!  I absolutely loved returning to Harper's Station and I can't wait to come again! ;)  The action scenes are fantastic and I truly love Grace as a character.  Beneath her shy exterior lies courage and a back bone of iron!  And Amos is a true gentleman!  I also loved the return of all my favorite characters, from Aunts Henry and Bertie to Emma, Malachi, Tori, and Ben.  But the secondary couple really stole the show for me.  I won't give anything away, but I've just got to say, I devoured every single scene about these two and would read this book over again for those scenes alone! ;)  Overall I dub this a MUST READ!

The only thing I wish was different has more to do with the publisher than the author.  As anyone who knows me knows, ebooks and I do NOT get along.  And I missed out on Tori's story because it's ebook only. :/  Or so I thought!  I'm SO excited that Worth the Wait (aptly named is it not? ;) ) will be releasing in a novella collection next year (OH I CAN'T WAIT!!!!!).  I wish it had been published before Heart on the Line or that Worth the Wait had been published in the beginning of Heart on the Line.  Ok I'll get off my soap box now. ;)

2771,"A modern parable which incorporates a great deal of useful information on the best way to live and enjoyable and satisfying life.  Julian is almost at the end of a marvellous holiday in Bali when he decides to go and see Samtyang who is a faith healer among other things.

Julian doesn't know why he decided to see wise man but feels compelled to do so.  He agrees that his health is good but he's unhappy.  He doesn't seem to do very well with relationships and he is fed up with his job as a teacher.  Through talk and giving Julian tasks to do Samtyang gradually gets him to realise what is wrong with his life.

If you're familiar with self-help books then you will find yourself nodding and smiling at the familiarity of the topics covered but sometimes seeing advice at work can help us to fix it in our minds.  If you think of parables in the Bible and the way the stories are easy to remember then you realise that this book is working on the same principle.  Human beings love stories and tend to remember them where facts or advice may not be retained.

I enjoyed reading this entertaining book and found it a useful reminder of ideas such as that we each create our own reality.  If we assume people will let us down then that is what we will find happening.  People take us at our own valuation - behave as though you are self-confident then people will assume that's what you are.

Money is not necessarily the key to happiness - though it may enable you to find it because it gives you freedom.  Choices may involve sacrifices but you should always choose which sacrifices you want to make and not let other people choose for you.  Everyone is master of their own life.

That's the other fun part of the book! These friends have been modeling since they were 5 years old, starting as flower girls and working their way up to brides, for Hailey's mom's bridal shows. What young girl didn't grown up want to be a bride, wearing that beautful, fancy white dress?
Let's not forget the men..all of them different, but all sweet and sexy! And each a perfect match for their Friday night bride. If you're a fan of great stories, filled with laughter, tears, friendship and love...this is definitely the book for you!",4,"[-3.0548320224231915, -1.9732060956913013, 0.28472467705850446, -1.0227682067571848, 0.06620986966564513]",0.28472467705850446

This is the second book in Kristen Proby's new Fusion series. We meet both Cami and Landon in Listen To Me but we don't really get to know too much about each character.

Cami has loved Landon since she first met him when they were just kids, she tried moving on and getting married but she realises no one will ever really live up to Landon.

Landon wasn't at all what I was expecting, he was so sweet and charming and you just couldn't help but fall in love with the hunky man!

Cami was a better character than I was expecting her to be, I thought I would like her sure but I ended up liking her so much than I expected to.

I have to say Kristen Proby has a way of writing men you just can't help but love, they always have me won over instantly.

There is always plenty of feelings involved when you read one of Kristen 's book's. She has just the right amount of hot and steamy scenes which leave you needing a cold shower, emotional and angst filled scenes that make you have a little cry and also a heaping pile of humour that leaves your sides sore from laughing.

Working on a Dream
Outlaw Pete (yes, I loved the ""Nebraska"" era in Boss music)
The Wrestler
Queen of the Supermarket

I admit, the rest is more 'pop' than I would like; however, some of the other 9 are growing on me. For instance, the unflappable cheer of ""Surprise, Surprise"" is hard to resist. And the more I listen, the more I like.

One thing I will commend Bruce for.  When so many CDs are the 10-song iTunes limit, he gives us a whopping Bakers Dozen songs lasting over 51 minutes. That's bang for your buck in a time when most of the time the dollar couldn't holler.

5217,"If you remember we were left with quite a cliffhanger in Before the Lie in which Corbin devastates Vi's world with a rash decision as a consequence of her ""actions."" When Truth Revealed begins, we've moved forward ten years in both our H/h lives and what a difference those years have made.

We find that Vi has made quite the name for herself and we're not quite sure what Corbin does, but I can tell just from his actions at the beginning of the book, that Vi is still at the forefront of his thoughts. And I loved how he was always thinking about her and still wanting to take care of her even though she broke his heart in two pieces several years ago.

Vi is in the middle of researching her latest book and has made friends with an ""expert"" in a particular proclivity and low and behold who ""takes over"" her research, but the one and only Corbin! There's so much emotion in how's and why's of Corbin keeping his eye on Vi and of course his natural alpha male personality is driving that, but I think this goes along with how he's never stopped loving Vi.

As the book moves through the next several weeks, many secrets are revealed that literally broke my heart. The pain and shame that Vi has been living with all these years is astounding, but we also get to see how Corbin reacts to what really happened and let me tell you...it's all growly alpha and I loved it!

There's so much that goes on from this point in the story that kept me glued to my kindle. The story moves at the exact pace that is needed for this particular story and the connection between our H/h is as strong as ever leading me to hope for their HEA.

I have to admit, I cried a lot when I read the book, I also laughed a lot  and I never really experienced the high school in the way it is generally portrayed in the books and movies so it was fun to read how the author conformed to the high school stereotype but made it so fun that you could laugh your pants off.
I loved the dynamics and intimacy between Walker and Daniel, the compassion both of them inspire in us, we keep our fingers crossed until the last page and I have to say that I jumped straight into the second book when I was done with the first one, you just cannot let go of the story as you want to know  what will be the punishment, what will be next

Another great story by Madison Faye! I love her OTT alphas and strong, yet submissive heroines. This one has double the pleasure with not one, but two, hot alphas - Luke Steel and Jordan Stone. Sasha Reed is at her wit's end without a job and has used up all her savings on her criminal loser ex-boyfriend whom she finally dumped after two years.

Sasha ends getting hired as the assistant to Luke and Jordan and when she meets them on her first day of work - BAM! Hot insta-love/attraction! Apparently the attraction is a two way street and both Luke and Jordan (who love to share women) find themselves instantly obsessed and possessive of Sasha.

The attraction between the three is steamy and the sex is hot and dirty! There is no cheating, but there is menage (m/f/m) and an HEA! If you love those, then this book is for you! And Madison Faye's books are on KU, which I'm a subscriber. I'm always happy when authors publish through KU since I feel like I'm getting my money's worth! The only thing keeping from giving this book 5 stars is I wanted more, more, more! More story! More sex! More of Sasha, Luke and Jordan!

Just from the size of the bag it was clear that this is a heavy duty product. The quilted topper is a dobby striped comfortable cottony feeling high thread count sheet that has extra foamy fill.

You don't know who you want to side with or feel sorry for more. You see a chance for the hatchet to be buried and yet the war still ranging on at times too. I love the chemistry between Zoey and Gordon. They are so alike yet so perfect. True feelings finally come to light and just wow. There is such a thing as taking revenge too far and yet it does take a bigger person to admit the wrong. But not only to admit the wrong but to also make things right all around.

If you've read Love in the Friend Zone then you know how grad night is getting on. I love how Molly is retelling it in snippets with each couple.

The book is written in a very user-friendly manner; no complicated verbage, just simple and to the point, which is refreshing.

4709,"Meaningful, insightful and emotional.  I so wish I could give this more than 5* as this was a book that deals with a subject millions of us struggle with on a daily basis.  A subject with still a huge amount of stigma attached to it and I applaud Ryan Michele for giving us a voice and bringing understanding.

Reign's life has been as bad as it can be and lives her life in the dark and her life is slipping further into the depths of despair where she sees no hope.  Her best friend makes a choice for her and gets her the help she needs.  Whilst receiving treatment, she is paired up with Lynx who is suffering from PTSD after experiencing the horrors of war.  Both have so much to overcome but give each other the hope they need and the strength to confront their demons.

This was not an easy read as it is dark and immerses you in the feelings of depression and the struggles to live a life in the light.  While the focus is on Reign and Lynx is her strength, it doesn't ignore his struggles and shows that daily life will always be a challenge.

If you are struggling yourself, please go seek help - you don't have to struggle on your own.

I felt totally connected to this book and the writing.  For me, this is an absolute must read.

4327,"OMG! I Loved this book. It is my number one favorite of the year.

Charlotte was in a serious accident and when she woke up from it she could see spirits. Her friends and family were unable to deal with this so Charlotte took off on her own. Living a life where you talk to the dead on a regular basis doesn't make it easy to have friends or to settled in one place. This makes life very lonely and hard for Charlotte. Unable to take it anymore she decides that she's goes to end her life. Standing on a bridge she contemplates everything she's been through when just as she is getting ready to jump she hears someone yell for her to stop. Looking over she sees Ike McDermott for the first time. She thinks he is real for a split second before she realizes he is just another spirit.

Ike McDermott pops up on the bridge to think about how he can help his family that is struggling with his death. Then he sees Charlotte getting ready to jump and moves to save her before she can do anything. Ike convinces Charlotte that if she helps him with his unfinished business that he'll help her make friends, find a place that will accept her and she can call home. Not really believing him Charlotte agrees anyways. The first person she meets is Mr. Mercer and she can tell that what Ike calls home is nothing like what she has experienced.

Ike's unfinished business is mainly with his brother who just so happens to be his identical twin. Charlotte never expected to find a place where she could finally settle until she started helping Ike. Its a rough road to helping Ike's brother George especially with the obstacles Charlotte has in her way. But the end result is worth the struggle to set things on the right path. Everything is starting to look good until something from her past brings her family back into her life. Will the people she has come to love be more accepting of what she is than her own family? Can she help Ike finish what he needs to so he can move on? I guess to find out you'll have to buy this book.

Theres just enough naughtiness, heartache, and love to pull you in. Those love scenes are scorchin!! Gavin and Kat just seem so perfect for each other. You definitely go on a roller coaster ride for this duo.

Born to a prostitute druggie, Kat has never had an easy life, but she is resilient and tough as nails. Kat is a survivor. Gavin never intended to be the man to pick the shattered pieces of Kats heart and put them back together again. Both riddled with a complicated past, Kat and Gavin find comfort in each other. I don't have any problem with the student/teacher storyline. To me, reading is a fantasy. I go beyond my comfort zone and will explore just about any book. This book made me laugh and smile but you also felt the pain oh the pain!! I wanted to scoop Kat up myself and protect her and just give her hugs.

This was a fantastic first read of Laura Lees for me! From what Ive read, this may be her
darkest book thus far but I might have to look into the other ones. Lee just has a great way of writing and telling her stories. I think most people will enjoy this book even if they don't do the student/teacher storyline. This is so much more than just that!

The creatures are different and wondrous, from mythical creatures such as Centaurs and Leshies, Pixies and Gnomes to Mages and magical powers.  Dr. Amy, who is a magical healer and who has the power of Truthsight, helps save the creatures who come for help. But the evil is let loose and she is being hunted. Will she be able to keep all those she cares about safe or will they fall prey to the evil? This book was hard to put down and had me enthralled from start to finish.

I am an experienced caver (spelunker) who has discovered and explored dozens of caves in the great cave belt of Virginia (USA). There are a number of good books on my type of caving and about the beautiful types of caves I have explored. On the other hand, ""Blind Descent"" follows some of the greatest most serious cavers on earth and gives the reader a rare glimpse into a deadly pursuit where only less than fifty people in the world are truly qualified.  This is a world where death comes rapidly and unexpectedly; where camps are established for those descending and who stay under the earth for weeks in a world where there is a complete absence of light. Blind Descent lays out the dangers and challenges and allows the reader into a world he or she has no way of otherwise entering by experience. The unqualified may try to enter this world but they will be returned in a body bag, if indeed it is worth the risk to return them to the surface. Welcome to ""Blind Descent.""

So, she starts surfing the net for a destination vacation, and happens upon a mountain retreat that will give her the space she needs... and so much more! A strong, sexy, brutish something more that completely changes the course of her life...

I have to say that I feel privileged to have the honor to get to read this series as a beta reader. I couldn't have asked for a better series than this one and I love, love -- absolutely love Bentley Reed and Anna Blake.

Melissa Toppen has done an excellent job so far with this series and if I thought I loved ""You and I Alone""....I have to say that I'm even more in love with ""You and I Together"". I could just imagine how I'm going to feel when I read ""You and I Forever""! I know I'll be extremely sad and extremely happy to see how their love story ends.

Both Bentley and Anna make such a great couple. Both are very good looking people and I totally love the fact that Anna is not a money hungry girl just looking to get her hands on Bentley's money. No, she really does love and care for him and her character is just so strong and she's such an independent person who doesn't want to depend on anyone but herself.

They both have their struggles to understand and feel each other out. Bentley is just way too good looking for Anna to not feel insecure and threatened by other women.

Bentley knows that Anna is hot and she's the only woman he has eyes for. He might have been a womanizer before he met Anna but he completely did a 180 when he met her and he knew that she was it for him. The problem is trying to convince Anna that she's it for him.

This book, no let me rephrase that, this series will have you hooked from page 1 and you will not want to put it down. You're going to fall in love with this series as much as I have <3

I spritzed and sprayed them all thoroughly, and all that this managed to do was to create havoc for the humans in the house. Someone would go to remove an item from a socket, get it on their hands (without realizing it), and then end up with a nasty flavor in their mouth when they ate something handheld (i.e. a cookie). Well, you'd think if it was such a great deterrent for people (we certainly didn't want to touch the cords for a while), then it would prove super effective in deterring the critters from chewing -- NOPE.

You will read how God has protected or how He has sent people signs by different things that happen.
  In the above section talking about this book it tells about a boy recovering from a massive brain injury. In that story a boy/young man wanted to see a miracle and God let him be in a miracle. He was in a horrible car accident with the doctors saying he wouldnt survive and if he did he would be brain damaged. He comes through it all and doesnt need much time to recover to his self before the accident. Afterwards he said during the accident God reached down and held his hand.

6359,"Wicked Favor was so incredibly fantastic! There was off the charts, smoking hot sex, awesome characters, and a wonderful story that was so sweet and playful. Great writing and flow between the POVs that had me hooked. I could not put it down! For all these reasons and so many more is why Sawyer Bennett will always be a go-to author for me. Loved this so much!

Jericho and Trista were amazing characters. They had awesome histories that were laid out and I liked them immediately. I was intrigued right from the beginning and was all in. I loved Trista just putting her self out there and opening up to so many things and really experiencing this opportunity she was in. She was funny and sweet and I loved how playful she was with Jericho. Jericho was sex on a stick! He was just this smart, commanding man that knew what he wanted and I loved that power he exuded. It was a wonderful thing to watch him change and grow throughout the story. They are so playful together during sex, as they explore their limits and she opens herself up to new things. Their chemistry was amazing and their need for one another is insatiable.

The sex was super freaking panty melting hot. I'm pretty sure this story contains one of the hottest scenes I've ever read. I had to put my Kindle down to regroup because WOW. Sawyer Bennett writes fantastic, detailed, well developed scenes. But besides the heat that's happening, there is also this wonderful connection between the characters that really pulls you in. So yes, it's extremely hot sex but it's just so much more.

The writing was fantastic. I loved the storyline and the conflict presented and why Trista was seeking out Jericho. I loved Jericho's internal battle that he was dealing with. It was so well developed with the prefect pace and it flowed so well. I loved the dual POV, I'd be on batted breath wanting to get back to the other persons voice. I was consumed by it all! I'm so excited about this series and am super curious about Kynan. I love all the characters introduced can't wait to see where this new series will go.

Wicked Favor brings the heat and the love sure. I didn't think it could get better than the original Wicked Horse series (because I loved each and every one of those stories) but the author out did herself because this was amazeballs.

I didn't realize this until I received the book but I had not read it previously so it was still new to me! I really loved the setting in England and how Edward promoted good thoughts, while the minister did not. Granted many people think ""miracle"" to be silly but this story made a good point on how people's minds work when they think there is hope. The candle miracle is not an amazing thought or idea but it makes for a cute story. This is a fun addition to my Christmas collection.

8553,I read this a long time ago but bought it as a single release.  Its one of my favorites because Bram is so cute and funny.  Gives good insight on how Ghleanna and Bram even made it work because they seem like such opposites!  She does such an awesome job filling in the gaps of their relationship.  Bram and Ghleanna totally mesh because he's so absent minded and has his brain on his work and loses track of time.  Then we have Ghleanna who is a warrior dragoness whose career is military and serving the Queen in the army and is away a lot and THAT allows Bram to do his alliances and work.  Its a great read and I highly recommend it.  I realize some readers get confused with all these different names and the reading orders.  Go to her website and check it out.

Both Davis and Bristol were well developed characters who were believable and had great chemistry together. The setting of the story set the pace for the book and made the instant attraction viable and realistic. I also loved the range of secondary characters that we were introduced in the story. I admit I'd love to see more of Kayden. He definitely has a story to tell.
Reading Surviving Us, I can really see the growth in Noelle's writing. There was more depth and life to this story and I have loved all her books. It's been a while since I have cried reading a book and darn it if I didn't have the tears falling with this one.
Surviving Us is a quick read and one that doesn't leave you bored or missing out. It's a great weekend read.

9707,"We haven't used this long enough to get a good reading on if it works as a cure
for hot spots. But, I'll share a few things, and update when we've tried it longer.
(Note that we received a bottle with a different design. Hope ours was the new one
and not the old one!)

First off, this has a photo of both a cat and dog on the label. So, you could assume that
this is for both types of pets. I am not entirely sure of that now.
When I saw the word ""spray"", I had assumed it would be a mist that would easily
cover an area on an animal. It isn't. It is a sloppy wet spray that drips easily.
It took a long time to dry off of a comforter that we had placed the cat on to spray him.
(He has a hot spot he keeps going after, even tho he is worm/flea free.)

Secondly, this has propylene glycol in it. I am NOT happy about that. That is an ingredient
often used in making anti-freeze and other car fluids. It isn't something I wanted to see
in my pets' products.

This might work well for dogs who do not normally lick themselves a lot, esp on their backs.
For our cat, this is going to be tricky. We didn't restrain our cat, since I thought it was
just hydrocortisone and aloe. But, we later found out that it was much more.
Not sure what kind of damage that this might do when cats lick for grooming, and will ingest
much more of the product than a dog would. It would be possible to put some sort of collar on
our cat, I suppose, but I didn't want to do that.

So, not happy with the product at all at this point.
Good for dogs, bad for cats.
It might have to go back.",1,"[-1.0900750828356158, -0.468925055116718, 0.2513286206076505, -1.0374303517765529, -0.5121829196482901]",0.2513286206076505

Emmie is very excited about her upcoming marriage to the man she loves, Isaac. She had been married before to a man who deceived her and, after his death, all these deceptions come to light. This is why she is at the Fort in Wyoming with her friends Sarah and Amelia. She needed to get away from her town where the gossip about her was running rampant.

Amelia has just had her baby when the story opens and Sarah and Emmie are pregnant with theirs. In book five, Emmie has promised Amelia that if anything happens to her while she is in child birth, that she will marry her husband, Jake. She made this promise long before she fell in love with Isaac and promised to marry him. When Amelia falls ill and then passes away, Emmie realizes that she must honor her promise and Jake is going to hold her to it for the sake of his child.

The Indian up-rises get worse and worse with the loss of many men at the Fort and it leaves everyone unsettled. They realize they must get reinforcements and Isaac volunteers, as well as a mountain man, to get to Fort Laramie to ask for help. Isaac gets lost in the blizzard and he is feared dead.

This was a satisfying book to the ending of this series of books. It's a very quick read and it will hold your attention to the end. I enjoyed it immensely. I give this book 5 out of 5 stars.

3257,"I received an ARC of this book for an honest review

Let me start with youll want to read Real by Katy Evans before you read this book.

Oh where to begin, this book starts off basically where Real left off.  I was so eager to read this book I love Remy and he just gets better and better (if thats even possible) . I feel like we get to know him a little better in this book and the story really focuses on Remy and Brookes relationship which I loved. I loved having them together and experiencing all the new relationship emotions that all couples go through only this is way more intense as of course all the women want Remy! (me includedlol). And well Remy is just an intense man! (right ladies?)

I don't want to go into too much detail about this book because I want readers to read it without knowing somethings that transpire in it but I will say that I loved this book more than I loved Real and I really loved Real. I like how the Author really addresses the mental health issues. Remy and Brooke grow so much together in this book and it was so nice to see a stronger side of Brooke and a more loving side of Remy.  I just LOVE them as a couple, I cant stress that enough! I feel that they compliment each other so well and the book is so very well written that you can just feel the all consuming love between the two of them not to mention the patience and understanding that Brooke shows Remy throughout the story but you also experience the pain and heartbreak for Remy as well. This is such a deep emotional wonderful love story with lots a steamy moments. Katy has really out done herself again! I cant wait for Remy to come out later this month. For those who have not met Remington Tate (Remy) you really should these are exceptional books that you don't want to miss out on reading and Remy is the best book boyfriend EVER!",4,"[-2.5118840052466442, -2.07972945287132, 0.2423354898348533, -1.017347114982286, -0.08536645132887155]",0.2423354898348533

The heater has two heat settings at low and high and is fairly quiet even at the high setting. There is no setup at all and you just plug it in and it is ready to go. It looks quite sleek and I love the way it oscillates on its base and is very sturdy. There are also 4 timer settings and LCD display looks very nice along with the remote for convenience.

Can you imagine getting kidnapped, then finding the man you blamed for your brother's death at the place you are being held until you are shipped off to Africa? What if he was the man that owned your heart? For Sam, this nightmare has come true. However, Logan suprises her and tries to save her. However, Sam isn't quite sure who to trust and fights what Logan is doing. However, he saves her and takes her to her family's cabin to keep her safe.
Sam doesn't want to give in to her body's desires for Logan. She blames him for her brother's death. That is what she was told and she knows what really happened, right? Does Logan have truth on his side? He knows Sam is the only one for him, now he has to convince Sam. When the real world comes crashing down on them, can Logan come through and save the day?
This book was sweet, even with some very bad guys doing evil stuff. There is some hot, steamy scenes as well. Sam and Logan are quite sweet and an enjoyable couple. Sam is a spitfire and Logan a badass, but together they are awesome. It really is a fun read.

7820,"Update: My first Caddy fell off my shower wall and broke after less than two months. After calling Oxo, Oxo sent a replacement and it has worked fine since then. I first gave this five stars, changed it to three after the first Caddy broke and have changed it back to five since the replacement works and Oxo sent a replacement at no cost. I did have to send e-mail photos showing the broken Caddy.

Here is my first review and then the update after the first one broke.

This really works well. I am using it in a tile shower and have three bottles on it plus some regular soap and a washcloth and it has held up for a couple of weeks and looks like it will continue to stay in place. It really helps because my tile shower has one built-in shelf that is way to small.

This is easy to install.  There is a handle in the center and all you do is position it in a corner and press the handle. When you do that, the sides expand until they come into contact with the  walls. The pressure and the non-slip pads on each side of the caddy do a great job of keeping this secure. I wanted my caddy to be a little higher after installing it and all I had to do was pull out the handle and then move it. No problem.

I actually called Oxo to see if there was a specific weight limit on this. If something is too heavy I would think this will fall. I could not get a specific answer. I have two bottles of shampoo about 13 ounces each and some liquid soap which is about 22 ounces plus a bar of soap and a washcloth on the caddy and it is holding fine.

There are holes in this so water will drain though rather than forming puddles on it. The bottles sit on it without a problem.

This is really great if you need another shelf in your shower. It works extremely well.

Update: I loved the caddy until I went to take a shower and saw it on my shower floor. It seems the pressure and nonstick pads were not enough to keep it in place and now that it fell it won't hold for more than an hour.",4,"[-1.7069623987701872, -1.2937370336489384, 0.23097990747179664, -1.028796071539898, -0.6082857445017658]",0.23097990747179664

We then meet Amber who is  a bit  bored with  how thing are going in her life at the beginning of the book  and has been  offered  a chance to  be  a muse of  mother nature. Rory and  Amber are both  moving into the same  apartment complex and also end  up  moving into the same apartment  by accident . I loved how the whole thing played out with  them sharing the apartment it was  very entertaining watching them  go at each other for the apartment it was hilarious at some parts , but at the same time it  created  some very sweet moments between them  The romance between these two  went above and  my  expectations . I adored these two and was very happy with were we left them at the end of this book .

Here are the specs and features:

- 3 line protection
- right-angle plug
- 15-Amp circuit breaker
- 120V 60Hz
- Noise filtering 40-45dB
- Joule rating 1300
- UL 1449 Rating/Clamping Level 330
- 6 ft. chord
- Illuminated on/off switch
- LED surge indicator
- Up to 8 outlets

The warranty paper claims 'lifetime' for the item itself and up to $50,000  on connected equipment for 5 years.

The lifetime in 'lifetime warranty' promise is not the purchaser's life but the life of the product itself. To quote from the Fellowes warranty document, ""the lifetime of the product is considered to be the time until the product naturally ceases to provide surge protection"". In other words, there is a warranty on the product for as long as it works. To quote again, ""when the LED fails to light, the product has performed its duty"" and the lifetime warranty is no longer in effect.

As for the $50,000 connected equipment warranty, the paper enumerates 10 instances under which the warranty becomes null and void including ""4. Fellowes determines that the equipment was not damaged by an Event or that no Event took place. 5. Fellowes determines that the Surge Protector was not properly installed, was tampered with, or was altered in any way.""

All the songs are classics here but none of them were really hits. 'Roadhouse Blues' is a killer tune and one of the best songs The Doors ever recorded. 'Waiting On The Sun' is a killer song about the American dream as only Jim Morrison could right, its very psycadelic.

Robby Kreiger is with out a doubt one of the most underrated guitar players of all time! Other stand out tracks are 'Blue Sunday' and 'Ship Of Fools' both of which are killer songs.

I made a quilt for my oldest daughter for Christmas this past year as she always loved a quilt that friends had made for us while we were in seminary and it needed repairs that I didn't think I could handle to continue being used.  So I made a new one for her.  Ramona Richards uses quilts that her mother and grandmother made to share beautiful stories of love, faith, and trust.  Each story includes a Bible verse and a prayer.  I love the heartfelt stories of the handpieced and machine sewn quilts made by women with great love intended.  Sometimes grief and sadness were melted away along with the stitches.  The work of quilting seemed to bring healing to both the quilter and the receiver of the quilt in many of the cases shared.  The pictures and colors are captivating and memorable.  Readers may well be inspired to create their own attempt at quilting after reading these delightful memories.  I felt like this book would be a nice accompaniment to a devotional time.

They're happily married and they love their children.
They've agreed to be each other's partner and refrain from keeping secrets.
Until the past comes back threatening both their present and future.

Fixed Forever was an excellent read. Seeing both Hudson and Alayna in a new phase of their lives tells the tale that happily ever after takes some work. Then you add the threat, and old habits come to surface as a way to protect the life they love so much.

This book was what I expected and then some. It was sexy, suspenseful, and in true Fixed fashion a little surprise to let you know that things are not what they always seem. Laurelin Paige truly gave this book what Hudson fans needed.

But he was also selfless in protecting those he cares for.  I enjoyed Vivi's character a lot.  I was glad she kept up her guard and was not a doormat, despite the explosive chemistry she and Logan had together.  The Pack scenes were great as well as heartwarming.  I love strong families in books.  Logan and Vivi were definitely a couple to root for in their happily ever after.  And the ending was major swoon worthy.

This is the second book in the series and the books keep getting better. Issac and Katia are two broken people due to the pasts they both endured. Katia knows why she is the way she is and is trying to make herself better. Issac is also broken but doesn't fully see how it has effected him in more ways than he thinks it has. He craves control. Katia wants to give her control to someone else. Issac wants to help Katia heal. He knows all that she has gone through. They both come to realize that they can help each other and find love in the process.. This story was wonderful to read. Once they admit all they have been through and what each one needs they are free to love one another. The scenes where they admit what they have been through had me emotional reading it.

7780,"This Komachi Kai Nakiri knife was my Christmas gift to myself (one of them!) as it was selling for a slight discount. I already had a Komachi 2 set purchased from Costco and wanted to add this Nakiri knife as I slice a lot of vegetables and it's very useful for that.

I use the Santoku knife (see Fuschia knife in the uploaded pic) for mincing and chopping herbs as a rocking motion is needed. For slicing onions and other vegetables a Nakiri is great, especially if you're making stir fry - Thai, Indian, Japanese or Chinese cuisines.

This knife is very sharp, the rectangular blunt shape makes it light and the right design for slicing which is a up and down motion rather than a rocking motion.

I love my Komachi knives, the colors are fun but the coating also helps prevent rusting. They're easy to clean in the dishwasher but mostly I just rinse and wipe and resheath. The included color coordinated sheaths helps keep hands safe whether you store them in drawer, or put them on the wall on a magnetic strip like I've done. It also makes it easier to take with you, as I sometimes take them camping or on vacation. They're light and sharp and handles are ergonomic and best of all they're available at very decent prices as a set.

This Nakiri knife was not included in any set I've seen so it had to be purchased separately. One month of usage later, I am very happy with it's performance. It's become my most used knife as I am always slicing onions, peppers, mushrooms or cucumbers. I also use the mandoline but that makes the veggies too thin for grilling or stir frying so this is a really useful knife.

After 5-6 months of every day usage you will probably need to sharpen and 1-2 swipes of a Accusharp Knife sharpener (also on Amazon) will do the trick.",4,"[-1.7645533703178815, -1.495944687466174, 0.22188256019518665, -1.0038812249651357, -0.5826046792536801]",0.22188256019518665

She has a certain style that makes me not want to ever put her book down, nor finish it. This particular series and book, are about vampires. She took the vampire lore and modified it a teensy bit. I LOVED it! And not just because she placed it in a country where I've got some roots from.

Our heroine, Joy Randall and her crazy BFF - gotta love a crazy BFF - are traveling to Europe. They end up in the Czech Republic, where she meets not one hot man, but TWO! One of them happens to be the famous author of vampire novels, Christian Dante. The other is Raphael Griffin St. John, a swoon-worthy man and hero! And really, he IS a hero.

I can't tell you how much I loved it and really, I highly recommend it! If you love funny and quirky, take-no-c**p heroines, vampire-romance-novel-obsessed BFFs, a possessive big hunk o' man and a sexy vampire that just doesn't have 'no' in his vocabulary, along with a storyline with plots and twists you don't see coming, then this book is for you.

I absolutely adored Heather and Josh. I loved Heather, so sweet and determined. She was just so feisty and I loved her attitude and awesome comebacks. Josh was so great too. Guarded but so sexy and playful. Their first meeting was priceless! Right from the start I was so pulled in and was just excited to read their story. They're animosity is fan-freaking-tastic. Flirty, funny, and challenging. I loved Josh and Heathers building chemistry. I loved it all! It's a true romance building from friendship. Every single thing just had me smiling and rooting for them. I love that the author pulled me in, making me feel everything they were going through. There is such a vulnerability to Josh and Heathers characters that made them so real and endearing.

While there are lots of entertaining parts throughout, this story is also laced with emotion and it really pulled on my heart strings. I loved Josh and got him and where he was coming from but just wanted to shake him and give him a hug all at once because he was being all manly-noble at times. I liked the hints throughout the story about his past and how everything development.

There are so many little details to this story that come together that make it perfection. I loved Josh's mom. The relationship the Belles have. How we got more of Logan, making me excited for his and Alexiss story next. I loved Heather's back story and her determination to make it on her own. I loved the story of her working on a wedding and how that worked into her relationship with josh. Every thing together just made for this excellent build so by the end I was laughing, crying, and smiling! It was just wonderful.

Loved the writing. So many details pulling me in. Really likable and interesting characters. Excellent pace and build. I was just so entertained while reading. Seriously excellent read!

Plus, what I particularly like is that Gingrich writes in a style that makes you feel you are right there with him in a comfortable, relaxed setting listening to him talk to you personally about his perspective on understating Trump.

From Gingrich's perspective, you'll ""hear"" him discuss why we may be at a watershed moment for our country, and how Trump's presidency represents a great effort to break away from a half-century of big-government liberalism. Further, you'll come away with a perspective on why the Left and much of the media are horrified because the age-old power structure on which they rely are specifically the ones President Trump is seeking to demolish and rebuild. Gingrich also discusses why Trump's election, and his approach to politics and governing represents a big opportunity to tear down the walls of big government, liberalism, and elitism and set a path for a new direction that is once again guided by the people, as opposed to the Left's intransigent power structure.

Regardless of whether you agree with all, some, or none of Gingrich's perspective on understanding our current president, I think you'll find -- if, as I said, you can keep an open mind while reading it, that Understanding Trump is a well-written book that will provide you with a lot of ""food for thought.""",4,"[-2.971778173881135, -1.7265380524565805, 0.2097732691889838, -1.041938898543864, -0.11613765938886034]",0.2097732691889838

Life has a funny way of coming around in circles, and karma is not always on target.  In fact, I feel like karma meant to stop at another house, one a mile or two down the road, and somehow ended up here, dumping a heap of cow poop right on top of me.

Shes going to get weepy.  I can feel it. The look on her face is as if someone has stolen her puppy, and I haven't even walked out the door.

Sometimes, you just have to say a prayer and go for it, hoping like hell that everything is gonna be alright at the end.  So, lets say a prayer and get on the road.  We have people to do and places to see.

My Review:

S.J. Sawyer continues to taunt and tease me with her entertaining and highly addictive tale by releasing just enough of it to keep me on the hook  like a crack ho on the pipe.  And after her latest release of Say A Prayer, I am really wanting to hit her in the back of her pretty head with my beloved kindle!  I know my predicament is all my fault  I really should not read serials  I am too impatient a less than appealing trait that I seem to forget each time I sign on for one hmm I should blame the wine!  But, sigh, she has done it to me again!  Here I was hoping for a conclusion and a HEA and she is stringing me along with yet with another installment of her ongoing NA dramedy.  But I am growing increasing anxious and restless for that HEA.  I am not a big fan of angst and conflict, but I am a big fan of steamy love stories, clever humor, and Mason, swoon - he makes this cougar purr!

I was lucky to receive an ARC of Unbreak My Heart, a book I was waiting years to read and I'm so happy to say that it was worth the long wait.

In so many cases readers have very high expectation of a book about loved secondary characters and they can be disappointed when they finally read about their story but Lorelei James sure delivered a brilliant story about Sierra and Boone.

Let me start by saying that you can read and enjoy Unbreak My Heart even if you never read the Rough Riders series, but I can promise you that after reading Unbreak My Heart you'll want to read every book in the Rough Riders series.

I don't want to give too much of the plot away so I'll just say that Boone is one of my all time favorite heroes and Sierra is just perfect for him.

I loved the secondary characters, we meet Kyler, Anton and Hayden McKay  a.k.a the McKayasteers and I can't wait to read more about them in next books in the series.

I also loved reading about Sierra's best friend and roommate Lu and Boones best friend Raj, Lu just cracked me up and I enjoying reading about them.

As always Lorelei James wrote a story that was very hard for me to put down and I find myself laughing, crying and just plain happy to read about Sierra and Boone love story.

This book read very smoothly. I was engaged from the very beginning, and I especially liked Lionel. I got to like him more as the story went on, and I really felt for him and hoped he could find happiness.

Conversely, I was not a fan of Emmaline at first. In my opinion, I felt her actions and venom towards Lionel were a bit overkill, especially given the situation she put him in. As the story went on, I liked her more,and ultimately, I admired her relentless protection of Lionel.

And can I just say, holy mystery!!! At about 40% through, a liiiiiiiittle tiny part of the book hinted at a major plot twist. Just a hint. I was completely sucked in by then, and I couldn't wait to see the resolution!

While this book is part of a series, it can be read as a standalone. Although, it does include cameos from characters in previous books, and while I've read some of them, I can't wait to go back and read all of their stories!

Excellent story and flow. Right from the beginning all these little intriguing details were laid out making me want more. Everything unfolded perfectly. I loved these very real and gritty characters. There is so much detail and depth, I was completely pulled into their complex lives and harsh reality.

I had a love-hate relationship with Shane Baxter. Not a nice guy at all. Shane was an amazingly well developed, complex character and he had all these layers and it was fantastic absorbing all the details. The guy is bad and makes no apologies but there is this growth that takes place that makes your heart melt and there are moments of redemption that made me root for him. The more I get to know Shane, the sexier and more intriguing he becomes. By the end, I freaking loved him! Dovie, I loved her too. She is strong, fiercely loyal, and self reliant. A fighter. She does what she has to to to survive in a positive way. Bax and Dovie together had some really hot times but it was a building attraction, not instant. I felt so real, like it truly grew.

I liked the element of mystery about where Race was a lot. The secondary characters were excellent and played into everything really well. It was an elaborate, detailed world and I could picture all in my head. There was a huge I did not see that coming moment towards the end. It was so intense. I was choked up and holding my breath. The entire story was intense and the ending was incredible!

This story was written in both Bax and Dovies POVs and I looked forward to both. Normally I have a favorite when reading but they were both such strong characters, I couldn't get enough of either. The chapters were long and there was something really satisfying about that. Nothing was rushed or slow, it all unfolded perfectly. I don't know what else to say (I need more adjectives!).

You read his novels and you just HATE the people he writes, the portrait he paints, but for those moments that you are engrossed in his book you have become those very demons.  He's is a mastermind...A freaking genius.  In his first novel, writen at 20 (which is so cool because I'm almost finished with my first novel, well my thinrd but my first to try and publish, an I'm only 20!) anyways, his first novel which is by far his best is written about Clay, a college student who visits home on Christmas break.  The plot is somewhat moot and it really leaves you hanging at the end, where you just kind of stare at the page and go ""what the @#$% just happened here"" but believe me, you'll thank him for that later.  Anyways, the life that Clay leads, the debatchury that his friends live is so engrossing, especially  for someone like me who has never even smoked a cigerette and who married his high school sweetheart and has never slept with anyone but her its somowhat thrilling to live someone elses life for a while.  The things that take place in this novel, while not nessisary to the story are quite disturbing in themselves.  There is a very graphic rape scene that is unexpected and may leave a real bitter taste in your mouth.  The subjects this book covers, everything from drugs, porn and prostitution and NOT for younger kids, and the attitudes expressed are not good.  What I HATED about the movie adaptation was that they tried to sugar coat the novel, making Clay and Blare REFORMED and they were trying to help Julian get over his drug habit as well as the prostitution.  THAT IS NOT HOW THIS BOOK GOES...EVERYONE DOES COKE AND NO ONE CARES THAT JULIAN GETS PIMPED OUT and that is what makes this book so amazing...it's real and gritty, true to itself and as contriversal as it can be.

My first ceramic pans were WMF skillets that I purchased at a great price at another site.

The WMF pans have no rivets inside and their ceramic coating is a deep gray.
Treated properly, they are wonderful to cook in, especially for things that normally stick in a stainless steel skillet.
They're my go to skillets for fried potatoes, omelets and any type of coated fish or chicken.

I never use metal utensils in mine and even when they are used to fry hamburgers, a quick soak and soapy sponge make it easy to clean them.
I've owned and used the WMF skillets for at least a year now and they still function flawlessly.

My hope is that this skillet will perform well long term too.
The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I'm not a fan of the white cooking surface.
During the gardening season, I prepare a lot of dishes with tomatoes and really hope it doesn't stain this skillet.

A love story of epic proportions but damn how my heart hurt throughout most of it. I felt so uncomfortable at times because the pain felt so vivid. Emerson's journey was so breathtaking and heartbreaking that I hurt along with her.
Emerson's journey was truly about introspection, about loving herself and finding her way back. To her loves and the things she was passionate about.
I can't and won't say too much about this story cause it will ruin your experience.
Kate Sterritt blew me away with her impeccable prose and storytelling. I instantly connected with Emerson and almost felt that I lived vicariously through her. The story flashbacked to Emerson's childhood and it worked perfectly. My connection to her and her journey only intensified.
Love My Way was definitely a surprise. A wonderful and angsty one but I loved every moment, minute and word of it. A must read.

4833,"After reading and absolutely loving The Fall Up, I remember desperately wanting a story for Henry. So I was beyond thrilled to hear about The Spiral Down!

Henry is a famous singer and travels the world on tour. Hes funny, charismatic, and loves nothing more than a man that only loves women. He craves that high he feels from conquering the untouchable straight man. Then along comes Evan.

Evan is the sexy pilot that comes to the rescue, in more ways than one. When he loves, he loves unconditionally. He is currently living the life of a straight man and has no intentions of becoming involved with a man ever again. Then along comes Henry.

Once all the walls built by past heart ache and fear of rejection come crashing down, these characters were smoking HOT together!

This book was funny, sweet, romantic, and very sexy. The writing was smooth and flawless with great characters, interesting storyline, and all the FEELS you would expect from this author.

Although this can be read as a standalone, I highly recommend reading The Fall Up first. That book is awesome and The Spiral Down has scenes that include characters from that book that you will love to hear from again. You won't regret one-clicking that one too, promise!

And Lastly,
Dear Ms. Martinez,
Carter?

Do you want to live your life to the fullest?  Is something stopping you?  Ken Davis, inspirational and motivational speaker, shares from his heart and own life experiences what it means to sleepwalk through life and how to find a life that is purposeful and full.  Whether you are carrying around extra weight around your mid-section or weighed down by fear, Davis helps you find what's missing and bring you back to the land of the living.

Only when you are living fully alive can you hope to bring honor and glory to God who created you.  Better than any self-help book which offers temporal solutions to a permanent problem, ""Fully Alive"" offers practical steps which will bring about a lifestyle change filling your life with joy and power only found in Christ.

If you've been struggling with your weight, a habit that needs to be broken or if you've lived in fear, Davis recommends practical steps which will guide you one step and one day at a time.  By looking at the next step rather than the past or the future, you can begin to move forward in victory and joy.

3430,"As someone who has felt un-rested so much, this book is a breath of fresh air. I have always equated sleep with rest, but Dr. Dalton-Smith shows us that they are two totally different things.

She shares with us the seven different types of rest, why we need it and advice on how to achieve it. She uses practical and scientific information to help us in our quest to find rest.

This book is in encouraging in the stories she shares and the encouragement to be intentional in our pursuit of rest. Each day of this devotional is a short section that is easy to read and will have you relaxing the minute you start reading it. I looked forward to opening this book each and every time.

If you find yourself feeling tired and/or burned out, this book is definitely for you. It will help you achieve the true rest that we all need. I give this book 5 out of 5 stars.

919,"I live in the PNW, a short walk to about 3,800 acres community forest lands which tend to be cool, wet, dark and filled with tons of fungi from late fall through early spring. During the past few years, ever since I began trail running, Ive become obsessed with mushrooms. So I was excited to read this book by a guy who knows a lot about mushrooms, especially edible mushrooms.

Just like Susan Orlean in The Orchid Thief, author Langdon Cook has a guy named Doug Carnell, a quirky character (of course), who he spends time with in order to learn everything you ever wanted to know about harvesting wild mushrooms. Several others are also willing to show him the ropes (like buyer Jeremy Faber), often involving picking without permits in areas where they are required and even on private land without the owners permission! Before becoming interested in mushrooms, Mr. Cook was a birder (I am also obsessed with birds). The book covers such subjects as: mushroom hunting/hunters and collecting/collectors (chanterelles, porcini, black trumpets, boletes, truffles!), a mushroom competition, mushroom sellers/buyers, descriptions of mushroom-containing dishes, David Arora (p 229), his book Mushrooms Demystified is largely responsible for introducing recent generations to the charms of mushroom hunting, and a bunch of stuff about fungi (p 5), All mushrooms are fungi, but not all fungi are mushrooms.  The format reminds me most of a book I love  the Good Rain by Timothy Egan, in that each chapter could sort of stand-alone. Of course it helps that I am mushroom obsessed, but I think that anyone who is even slightly interested in them will enjoy this entertaining, well-written book. Best of the book: everything exceptWorst: photos of the maybe a dozen of the mushrooms he mentions would have been awesome. Also excellent:  David Aroras Mushrooms Demystified, Timothy Egans The Good Rain and Robin Wall Kimmerers Gathering Moss.",4,"[-1.0894621842028853, -0.9147442002194855, 0.16905867803411567, -1.0449535712730875, -0.31975269993116306]",0.16905867803411567

Reading this novel, I remembered again that feeling I had when I once again gave everything, including my dreams to the Savior who loves me more than anyone could. I too, prayed that I could carry that feeling of euphoria into my daily life and that it would change the way I looked at life around me. And as I read, I determined once again to make that commitment without fear or anxiety.
We as a family just came through an amazing miracle ourselves when our Mom survived an emergency surgery after a colon in-fracture at the age of 86 years. Having spent 6 weeks in a hospital environment with her, I found the scenes describing the interactions of nurses and doctors as well as administrators  to be very revealing. Never having been to the Holy Land, I traveled there with Emily and Amanda and feel that if I ever did go, I would recognize the streets, the market places and most important of all, visit Bet Jola, and the house of Miriam.

Jesus and the Beanstalk : Overcoming Your Giants and Living a Fruitful Life

by Lori Stanley Roeleveld

The book is set up with six daily readings per week, with the sixth day being a Prayer, Reflection & Process Day.  There are multiple chapters with different topics to dig into.  After each reading there are questions that would be perfect for journalling through Small Steps Towards Slaying Dragons.

Each chapter is a short read  but it delves into the subject of giants in our lives and how to live out our faith!  I have thoroughly enjoyed reading through this book.  Such a great reminder of our victory through Jesus.

As a homeschool family, we have chosen to make Fairy Tales a part of our regular reading.  When we started this journey, our curriculum listed books that included fairytales and other myth style stories.  At first, these stories just seemed like fun stories, but now, I realize that they allowed my children to have their imagination grow and blossom.  Not only do fairytales paint a picture that allows imagination to grow, but these tales of good overcoming evil reminds us that we are destined for a better place.  These fairy tales connect us to a desire for good to prevail.

The story of Jack and the Beanstalk remind us that the little guy can win  but only by trusting.  We are called to trust in our faith  in the God who gives us that faith  and by doing that we can defeat the giants in our lives.

I have enjoyed reading the devotions in this book.  Each daily devotion has taken me into a deeper examination of my faith and what exactly the giants in my life are.  I recommend this book for anyone who is wanting to really strengthen their faith, anyone who wants to really look at conquering the giants in their own lives.

The characters in the community are authentic, pragmatic, and represent humanity at its basic level. They rise to the occasion consistently, practicing their generosity as a way of life. There is depth to personalities that transcends the norm.

I'm still reeling from this incredibly well-written novel. The undercurrents that are evident throughout the book become the pinnacles that bring the story to a powerful ending.

This shows the history of the zombie war from start to finish and it does an amazing job showing us how different people saw the zombie war, how they dealt with it, how their skill set helped them survive and helped the war effort take back the world from the living dead.

My favorite parts are the Battle of Yonkers and the Battle of Hope.  The author does an amazing job describing these battles and how panic set in when conventional warfare wasn't effective against zombies the way it was regular human beings.  All the high-tech warfare that we have and use like stealth bombers, radar jamming, mis-information, propaganda, depleted uranium anti-tank rounds, all completely useless against the zombie hordes.

The book is really amazing and is a must have for any fan of the zombie genre.  Seriously, if you like zombies even a little bit, then you will LOVE this book!

Cole comes to Blue Lake to do a couple concerts and sneak in a little relaxation after an exhausting tour. He rents out Rachael's entire Inn to make sure he gets the break he needs.

This book was fantastic! The plot was unique and engaging, and holy smokes, Michele wrote some SMOKING HOT love scenes!

This was one of those stories where it felt like the characters truly loved each other. The emotions were written so well that I could feel exactly what Michele had intended for me to feel.

Erin was fun to read because she was so vulnerable. She had self-doubt and humility, and she had a realistic view of what was going on around her and with Chance.

Chance was absolutely adorable. He knew he wanted Erin and immediately stepped into the role of being her man. He protected her when she needed it and fought for her to prove how he felt. Sigh!

I was also introduced to Chance's brothers. Michele did an excellent job of giving me a summary of each of them, and, needless to say, I will be reading each and every one of their stories (starting with Jake's story, which is the next book in the series!)

All in all, this was a very clever, very enveloping rock star romance and I am now a BIG big fan of Michele Callahan!!!

Autumn Manning was distracted that day.  Getting on the train was a blur and even one year later, she still cant remember the day of the bombing.  She is tormented by grief and guilty.  She spends every day searching for answers haunted by the lives of the victimspeople she never met.

Paul Elliott lost his wife in the bombing.  All he wants is to let the memories of the dead, and his guilty, stay buried, but when he and Autumn are forced together, he believes she will not be helpful in moving his family forward.

This deeply moving story which looks at life through the lens of death and tragedy brings us to consider the ultimate purposes of the events that shape our life.  When the whys cant be answered and the what ifs hang on every thought, we must come to accept the goodness of God in everything or remain stagnant in our grief.

Life After by Katie Ganshert is a remarkable, thought-provoking story that will break your heart and lead you to hope at the same time.  What will Autumn have to do to overcome her guilt and how will Paul ever get over the pain of his own guilt?  Trust me-you will want to know.

Spinning out of control for a short bit  Talbot comes back full force with a vengeance  against Lycans!  Although Talbot has concrete, steel and titanium barriers up around his heart a few people worm their way in and become more than friends  family.  Of course what Matthew can brew up helps to break those barriers down big time!  Azile, the Red Witch, makes her move as well, both in battle and out.  Talbot doesnt stand a chance  he will rejoin the human race if it kills him.

Political intrigue which Talbot has very little patience for and against all odds, he is the man, the savior of Talbot town.

Again, Michael Talbot is entertaining with his unique mannerisms and masterful delivery of one-liners that will have you snickering then full-out belly laughing.  Talbots memories and ties to his family are poignant and heartfelt leaving the reader near tears and sometimes smiling.

Lycan 2 is not for the weak at heart as it is violent and gory.  The mannerisms of Michael Talbot and his relationships snag the reader and create a bond that is strong.  Talbot is addictive!

Mark Tufo maintains the personality of Michael Talbot and his other characters sometimes bringing them out in new friends but the integrity of Michael Talbot remains clear and ever present.

Sean Runnette is Michael Talbot.  He has embodied the Talbot mannerism and quirkiness excellently.  Runnette is an excellent narrator for this series.

Podium Publishing did an excellent job on the production as they provided a clear production without distracting noises or other issues.

Finally, we get to go back to Blesswood and hang out with our beloved Abcurses! I know we have all been waiting on the second book to come out and it does not disappoint. Book 1 left us with Willa being hit by Rau's curse and magically linked with the 5 Abcurse brothers. Who wouldn't want that right?! Well there are a lot of dwellers and Sols who are not happy about the odd relationship that has developed between the six of them. This leads to Willa finding herself in several sticky situations.

Willa is just as funny and clumsy as always but seems to find herself with a new strength. The Abcurses are coming to terms with having their dweller attached to one of them at all times. A dweller who is ALWAYS in some kind of trouble. Just when they all seem to be accepting of their current fate, someone steps in to try to rip them all apart.

We learn a lot in this book. We find out the true reason for the curse from Rau and what it means for them. We learn more about Topia and the beings within. We also have a ton of action going on. Fighting action, get your head out of the gutter ;). I know it's hard when the Abcurse's are involved. We get just a little bit of 'action' with them too. Real touchy feely that lot. Ok, back to the real action. The Gods, the Sols even the dwellers, Nobody is safe. Change is coming and nobody knows if it will be good or bad. One thing's for sure, there will be Chaos.

This is definitely one of my favorite RH series and I'll be counting down the days until the next one is released.

I piped it into my receiver and hit the power button and bingo! it found my network over it's installed handy dandy wireless network adapter (G).  It prompted me for my password, which I entered (by turning the knob, which was kind of a pain) and it connected no problem.  You can also wire your connection through the network cable slot in the back, however, no network cable was included.

After that, I chose internet radio and I had choices galore.  The real beauty of this device is how you can personalize it.  Got a Pandora account?  Pipe it through this baby with ease.  How about Live365?  You can do that too.  Want to search the internet radio via genre? No sweat.  Absolutely amazing I tell you.

I created my Grace account, added stations online and podcasts and after unplugging the device and plugging back in (yah, they tell you to do that so it updates the streams), my customization was found on the device and away I went.

Here is the absolute frosting on the cake...I'm now streaming all of my music from my laptop and external hard drive to this device!  Sort by genre, album, album artist, create a queue, you name it, this thing can do it.  This kills the Windows Media Center that never worked right with my 360.

There was this instant chemistry that I loved, it was  a cool contrast to have the eldest sister falls for the youngest brother. The dynamic they both have with their siblings was an interesting layer to this story.

Gianni Santini, is smooth, sexy, and fun. I would love to find a man like him. He treats Kianna like this rare treasure that is meant to be pampered and held above all others. He was swoon worthy. Kianna is smart and sexy, and willing to let a younger man sweep her off her feet. The ways that Ms. Schroeder has their relationship grow and build is beautifully done. We got to catch up with Leo and MJ and got to see a taste of Georgia with this book.

I recommend this Santini for the sensual side of Gianni, he's the smoothest brother yet! This is a story of love that's just the right length for full satisfaction.

Pray A to Z : A practical Guide to Pray for your Community is a great tool to have on your shelf!  Amelia Rhodes has set up the book so that you can look up a topic and go through that section to pray in that way for your friends, neighbors, etc.

So often our prayer life can seem scattered and disorganized.  Instead of wandering from topics or requests, this book will help you make sense out of it all.  Praying by topic of the people in your life is a simple way to organize things.

This book is sorted alphabetically, from A to Z (hence the title) and there are over 150 different topics for you to pray through; from adoption to zeal, I can honestly say I could not think of a subject that was not in here.

This is a great tool, for that time when you want to transform your prayer life.  When you want to breath some fresh life into your prayer time, this book will help you focus and organize what you want to go through!

I enjoyed going through this book, and I look forward to having it as a tool for my prayer life and my library!

The first portion of this memoir tells the story of the average teenage girl. She is somewhat insecure, has had plenty of experience being the new kid in town and is trying to settle into a rhythm in her young life. She loves her dog, her best friend and her family. A phone call changes all of her plans, when her mother decides they are going to travel through China and live out of a backpack for a full year.

I could feel the devastation that young Savannah felt through her writing. She is very talented at expressing her memories and emotions through words and truly makes the reader feel as though they are right along beside her for the duration of the journey. What a journey it turns out to be--so many ways to experience all of your senses in this book!

It was amazing to read about this girl and her family and how much she grew up and changed over the course of their adventures. The descriptive language she uses to tell of her surroundings and each new place they visit made this somewhat like watching a movie. You could smell the air and see the colours through her words.

This is more than just a simple travel memoir. This is a story of spiritual and mental growth, physical change and family. Be careful when you read this, you might just want to sell everything you own and buy a sturdy backpack for your own adventure.

One of the main things I enjoyed about this book was the humor. There is a thread of hilarity that spans the course of the story, and the author never loses the ability to make her reader feel warm inside even during the portions that are more serious.

This is an excellent book from a talented author, and I recommend checking it out. You won't be sorry you did.

5469,"Such love and warmth and laughter and friendship emanated from this novella, courtesy of Cynthia Ruchtis talented pen. Grandma Dodie and Grandpa Wilson are just the absolute sweetest and cutest couple ever! I want to be like them when I grow up.

For as much as I had tears in my eyes while reading An Endless Christmas, I also laughed out loud just as frequently.  Sometimes merely lines apart. Between Grandma Dodie and Uncle Paul, I don't remember the last time I laughed so much at people who weren't real!

And the other people? Oh goodness, that family. Next to my own, the Binders are my new favorite family.  Grandpa Wilson and his nightly blessings and song.  Micah and his steady heart.  Brogan and his choice of sleepwear.  All of them welcoming Katie as family even though  maybe especially because  she said no to Micahs proposal.  The adorable girls and the Christmas pageant.  Oh my heart, the pageant! A word of advice for when you get to that part in the story  keep a tissue or two handy for the tears that will leak out but also eat or drink at your risk until its over. Laughter-induced choking hazards ahead :)

Probably the best part though? The fact that this family  even in their cute, sweet, humor-filled LOVE for each other  is full of a bunch of people who are human. Sure, they teased and bantered and hugged a lot.  But they also cried sometimes.  They admitted past failures.  Some of them were struggling to make it as single parents or new parents or parents whose parents were aging.  Through it all though, they loved each other deeply and steadily.

I think everyone is craving that in todays world.  Someone  a person, a family, a community  who will love them that completely.  Warts, scars, debts, track records and all.  During this season where we celebrate Jesus birth, An Endless Christmas is such a beautiful reminder that Someone does love all of us  each of us  just like that.

7327,"Nearly every successful artist has recorded a Christmas album, but few can stand up to Celine Dion's ""These Are Special Times"". Filled with beautifully-performed tracks, this record will be forever remembered as a timeless classic.
Opening up with the cathartic hymn, 'O Holy Night', Dion uses her strong vocal chords to send the sacred piece into the heavens, then gently brings it back to earth. 'Ave Maria' is beautifully enhanced by her tender vocals, adding an unusual touch to this Christmas compilation.
What makes this album different from all of the other Christmas records out there is its diversity in music. Everyone can sing 'Joy to the World'. Celine brings listeners something different, uniting both sacred and secular tracks in one seamless arrangement. New songs 'Christmas Eve' and 'Another Year Has Gone By' stand proudly aside classics such as 'Feliz Navidad' and, my personal favorite, 'Happy XMas (War is Over)'.
If you're looking for a great Christmas album that truly captures the tenderness and joy of the holidays, look no further.

2190,"This is a great book because not only does it thoroughly cover the standard procedures for renting, but it's also FUN to read because it even contains the tips that cover unusual events.  Flipping around the pages you'll come across things like:

""Never, never let anyone stay in your property on a temporary basis.  Even if you haven't signed a rental agreement or accepted rent, you give someone the legally protected status of a tenant by giving that person a key or allowing him or her to move in as much as a toothbrush.  Then, if the person won't leave voluntarily, you will have to file an eviction lawsuit.""

""Caution.  You may not be able to restrict a child care home business.  A tenant who wants to do child care in the rental may be entitled to do so, despite your general prohibition against businesses.  In California and New York, for example, legislators and courts have declared a strong public policy in favor of home-based child care and have limited a landlord's ability to say no.""

""Installation of satellite dishes and antennas.  Federal law gives tenants limited rights to install wireless antennas and small satellite dishes.""

""If you want the tenant to perform maintenance work for you in exchange for reduced rent, don't write it into the lease or rental agreement.  Instead, use a separate employment agreement and pay the tenant for her services.  That way, if she doesn't perform, you still have the full rent, and you can simply cancel the employment contract.""

""The Harvard School of Public Health has published the definitive guide to bedbugs.  See hsph harvard edu/bedbugs for pictures, advice on eradication, and prevention.""

""According to the U.S. DEA, signs of a meth operation are...""

""Photographs.  If your termination notice is based on your tenant knocking a hole in the kitchen wall, you'll want to show the judge a photograph of the gaping hole.  But before the picture can be admitted into evidence, someone will have to testify that the picture is a fair and accurate depiction of the way the wall looked.  It's best to ask a neutral witness to look at the wall and come to court prepared to testify that yes, the photo is an accurate portrayal.  Your witeness need not have taken the photo.""",4,"[-2.5887729171609575, -1.3561240726415034, 0.11855789517069337, -1.0276079492007342, -0.8387651244072177]",0.11855789517069337

2920,"Harry Kraus in his new book, ""A Heartbeat Away"" published by David C Cook brings us into the life of  Dr. Tori Taylor.

From the back cover:  Haunted by memories of a murder she never witnessed
Dr. Tori Taylor rules the operating room with a cold precision that makes nurses cower and her colleagues take notes. But even with her success as a respected surgeon, Tori finds herself alone in her moment of desperation--dying on her own operating table.
Tori needs a heart transplant, but what she receives is far more than just a donor organ. Lying loveless and friendless in the recovery room, Tori experiences flashes of terrifying events she never witnessed.  Soon she leaves her controlled world and starts investigating a homicide only she believes happened.  Is she hallucinating?  Or will someone believe her in time to stop a murderer from killing again?

Ever heard the expression, ""the heart remembers""?  Well it seems that medical science has discovered that this is true.  The doctors have found memory engrams in the heart similar to those found in the brain, where we normally think of memory.  This only goes to prove the Bible is accurate when it tells us, ""guard your heart.""  Dr. Kraus has given us a page flipping thriller that is ripped from the current medical journals and added in an intense search for a murderer.  The character of Dr. Taylor is so well written.  First she starts off as a cold controlling person withdrawn from humanity but with the heart transplant she softens as she learns that God has taken from her old heart of stone and given her a new one of flesh.  ""A Heartbeat Away"" is a very exciting adventure that kept my attention all the way until the end.  I recommend it highly.

I also took it to church and read it to my class of six year olds.  It explains the concept of bucket filling and tells kids the importance of having a full bucket.  It gives them ideas on how to fill other people's buckets and keep their own bucket full as well.  It also goes into bucket dipping, or trying to steal someone else's happiness.  Bucket dipping never works because when you empty someone else's happiness bucket, yours empties too.

This is a fantastic book for young children and it teaches a valuable life lesson about kindness.  The kinder we are to others, the happier everyone will be.

5822,"""Belief is a noun. Believe is a verb.""  For me this quote sums up Bryant Cornett's commentary on the gospel of Jesus Christ, the title is taken from Peter's denial after the arrest of Jesus, right before the Crucifixion. This book is like no other I have read: on my Kindle it is interactive; which means whatever I am reading is linked to a scripture reference that I can click on to go more in-depth. Having read and studied the Bible for years, this was informative, and fun, trying to guess what scripture he would quote--many times he would give me something new to think about. For any level of seeker this can be enlightening. The author wrote the book based on a Sunday school lesson that he gave and recorded. It can also be downloaded and heard with a link he gives in the book. At the beginning of each chapter, and before you start the lesson; he gives you gospel chapters to read. This is a superb tool for anyone learning about Jesus and The Bible. For new believers or seasoned followers it deepens your walk with God. Another one of my favorite quotes is: ""But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being."" So many great thoughts are packed into this Spirit inspired gem that I'm giving it 5 stars.",4,"[-1.07123925102607, -2.109814549049354, 0.06042578192700443, -1.0022022910034003, -0.3275775516994328]",0.06042578192700443

Pulling out existing weeds is one of the seemingly most futile jobs in the world because others will always grow back. That's why I love using this product. So easy, and only pull out weeds once or twice.

Seven women, best friends, each unique in their own way, struck by freak lightning that changed their lives forever. One by one they will meet their destined true half and unlock their paranormal self. Lily has found her happily ever after with her warrior angel in Dust of my Wings. Jamie got her men in Her Warriors' Three Wishes. Now it seems it is Becca's turn.

Becca has known there is a strong link between herself and Hunter from the moment he saved her from being attacked. However, it is hard to claim your man when he keeps leaving you for long periods of time with no word of when he will be back. Fortunately, Hunter has decided that regardless of his Pack's issues, he can't wait any longer before claiming Becca as his true half. But of course nothing comes easy for these two. Becca and Hunter have to face not only conflicting wolves, but also the acceptance of Becca's own people, once her paranormal self is finally unlocked. They will have to decide if a love pre-destined by Fate is worth fighting the odds in order to get their own Happily Every After.

With a hot alpha wolves that knows just when to pressure and when to sit back and let a woman take care of herself, how could you possibly go wrong? Ryan takes her unique world building ability to create a world for us filled with the unbelievable and makes us believe it.

5823,"A Rooster Once Crowed surprised me. I'm not sure what I was expecting from this book, but the author has written an in-depth commentary rich with biblical history and scripture to support it. In the introduction the reader is asked to make a decision, to remain in the world of familiarity or to change course and run toward the realization of the truth. This decision will determine how one believes and live out the future. This is a journey in God's love, the Gospel of Jesus Christ from the Cross to Revelation.

Bryant Cornett uses scriptural examples and suggested readings throughout the Bible, from Creation, the Trinity, heaven, the Fall, the prophets, the gospels through Revelation. The reader is invited to enter the Great Dance which is developed throughout the chapters in this book. The author's own revelations are a key part of this journey toward heaven, and his story is creatively shared for the benefit of the unbeliever or a long-time Christian who hasn't felt passion in his spiritual life. It all begins with a choice.

This book is written with an intensity that is contagious. Mr. Cornett writes with energy and enthusiasm that virtually sings its way throughout his lessons regarding The Greatest Story Ever Told. His story is based on solid foundations through the use of practical verses and passages from the Bible, and his excitement about living for God is contagious! There is much to be gained from this book. I intend to use it for a greater in-depth study for my own benefit. I would be more inclined to use this like a devotional, with time each day to reflect on the lessons this book has to offer. I recommend reading this book. It's an education and a revelation.

2948,"Positive: The concept. I love the idea of Wanteds, Necessaries, and Unwanteds. I love that the Unwanteds might have been headed off to the Death Camp but end up in the colorful, magical world of Artime. Of course, the Wanteds think they're pretty hot stuff, getting to stay in their gray, structured world of Quill. And the Necessaries, well, they stay in Quill and ""get"" to do the grunt work (poor Necessaries).

Positive: The magic of Artime. It's so cool how the magic forms to each kid's individual talent. If you're a singer, your magic emerges in the music you make. If you're an artist, the magic flows from your paintbrushes and pictures. And, once the kids have some basic skills in their talent area (since they had absolutely no exposure to it in Quill and had to learn from scratch), they get Magical Warrior Training, truly harnessing their magic in creative ways, learning how to protect themselves and defend their new home.

Positive: The creatures and other denizens of Artime. I'm not sure if they were created by the original magic-users or if they just appeared fully formed in the world, like Athena sprang from Zeus's head. Either way, they're creative and unusual: Platyprots, girrinos, alligator-octopi, a winged tortoise named Jim; huge stone, winged cheetahs (yes, that's him on the cover; he's not chasing the kids either, he's helping defend Artime alongside them); and even talking blackboards with snarky personalities.

Wish: That Alex didn't turn into a sad sack in the middle of the book. Alex pines for his brother, Aaron, who stayed in Quill and is satisfied with his life there, not even thinking of his brother (okay, he is...just a little bit). He wants to rescue Aaron from his gray existence. But he winds up completely withdrawing from his friends (yes, there were some other circumstances but still). I feel for him but he's a bit too withdrawn.

Overall: A fabulous middle grade read! THE UNWANTEDS is an exciting journey through a stark, rule-bound world and into a magical realm where paper dragons breathe fire and the mansion where they all live really is bigger on the inside.",4,"[-2.8643348385300307, -3.208415665042411, -0.007737903107413624, -1.0168653505814529, -0.5758236097900276]",-0.007737903107413624

It is, as is usual coming from the mind of a scientist, an extremely optimistic and glowing portrait of humanity's inevitable march of technological progress, with very little concern or thought put into the wild contradictions of modernity, how the forces of free market capitalism, democracy, environmental degradation, etc. will play out.  Scientists do not live in a bubble, and if the world is at war or swept up by revolution then science cannot function.

In this book the author recounts her experiences and emotions as her husband becomes more and more unstable. While learning along the way about mental illness and its pitfalls, she carefully documents all of the things that she now sees as red flags, in hopes that others might see those flags as well if they are experiencing similar behaviors in those they love.
Each chapter is followed by facts and / or statistics relevant to that chapter. Historically, more focus has always been on the person with the illness, as opposed to how it affects everyone around them.
Of course, that is natural, and as it should be. However, the devastating wounds inflicted on others is still something that needs to be addressed. In sharing her experiences, we learn that despite the huge numbers of people that will experience mental illness at some point in their life, stigma and denial still run deep.

To be honest, one of the reasons that I felt good about reading this book is that it now makes me want to read Deepak Chopra's latest book.

They are easy to put into the ground. Position at the drip line, tap into the ground with a heavy hammer, gently, while holding the plastic tip tightly on the spike, remove the plastic tip to reuse and give the spike a couple more hits to sink it further into the ground and cover with a little soil. Make sure the soil is very soft or the spike will just break apart.
