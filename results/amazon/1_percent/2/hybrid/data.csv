When I one click I want something that does not drag, something that pulls me in, Something that keeps me into it and not skip through hoping the book picks up,  and this book did not do that
It was a good idea for a plot, just dropped,
There are 69 critical reviews always check critical reviews before one clicking. I learned my lesson.
It is young, The writing was childish. It is like the writing was all over the place.
And I absolutely hate a book, where the characters go back and fourth til the end, I can not connect with the characters.
It was to much stupidity, I did not finish this book. The worse part is I did not start the book til 10 days after one clicking so I am stuck with something I did not like because I can not refund it.
I do not like cheating. These characters are just so young, you would think they was in middle school. Actually middle school students probably are more mature then this.

Certainly the most confusing movie I've seen, this film instantly landed a spot in the top 5 worst films I have fallen victim to.

How did it get made?  That's the real mystery.  There weren't better scripts out there?  I could write a better script if I simply sat on the keyboard.  (Believe it or not, after this turd, somebody actually gave this guy money to direct another movie -- although not based on his script.)

It's like they gave a 14-year-old kid millions of dollars to make a movie and a single afternoon to write a script.  The script has no ideas or insight about anything -- terrorism, war, the media, the political machine, Marxism, you name it.  The movie is impossible to take literally (everybody's looking for Boxer, yet he can just go to a sidewalk cafe?), yet has nothing coherent to say on any allegorical level.

There are too many characters and the connections between them are unclear.  That voiceover guy seems to never stop introducing the movie, which initially reassures you since you're constantly confused, but clarity never comes.

Plus it just goes on forever.  Supposedly Andrew O'Hehir called this film ""about the biggest, ugliest mess I've ever seen.""

I mean, despite what the blurb suggests, it doesn't even have a main character. What do you do with a book that doesn't have a main character or couple? What do you do? (As an aside, that blurb is totally inaccurate anyway.) There's no plot. The characters do everything from pine for one another to assassinations to buy a horse that randomly gets bitten by a snake. There's insta-lust and a relationship that goes from 0 to 4,000 in about a page. There is endless agonizing over if the characters are a couple yet and if they're gay or not, all in artificial and exaggerated ways. There's pointless past trauma that is too much to be believed.

There is telling, telling, telling about how wonderful and significant and 'I'll be with you forever even though we've been a couple for 2 days' the characters feel, all adding up to basically nothing. Nothing that happens is believable. None of the emotions read as believable, not even the lust (though that's not really an emotion, I suppose). These men are supposed to be super elite soldiers and assassins, but they agonize over everything like teenager, and I don't just mean the emo stuff (though that's non-stop from page one) but if a teammate gets injured or is doing his part of a mission out of sight or killing. All the things a highly trained soldier would take in stride (and we're told they do) they are shown to whinge about. And the technical aspect of these soldiers?

It was so almost a good book, really.  Almost.  But I skipped huge chunks because I was disgusted beyond belief at how beyond stupid-gone-to-seed the heroine was.  STUPID. Another one of those women who know better than everyone around her so subsequently endangers everyone around her.  Then there were times ""No I'm not doing that"" then two seconds later she's doing it - or the Hero is. The continuity was pretty bad - I mean I know people change their minds but constantly, Every other page?  I really hated the heroine. I cursed my Kindle and wanted to throw it when she did stupid things. She was so doggone immature, selfish, self-centered, and I challenge you to believe she really loves the Hero. Love gives not takes. Love thinks of others first not themselves.  I got to the point that I didn't care about her past - it made her selfish so who cares?

OK OK - I'm fine now.  I really did want to like the book.  It's not bad but when I skim that much, it's also not that good. Once I take a dislike to a character I always HOPE they somehow redeem themselves so I can like the book - that never happened.  I won't be reading the next in the series because, honestly? I can't take the pain of her stupidity and I just flat don't care. AT ALL

Remember this is just MY opinion.  Others obviously liked it and have a higher pain threshold than I do!

I recently purchased a Panasonic phone system. They are poorly made and the headset jacks are loose. Within months all of them did not hold my headsets anymore. When I saw this phone I figured I could not lose. I would have the phone and the headset.

Comfort wise it is the most comfortable phone I have ever owned.

The thing that is preventing me from giving it a full 5 stars is the sound. It is a bit tinny and I have a hard time hearing people.

I am a great fan of almost all the stars especially Michael Douglas and Shia LaBeouf.  I finally thought how bad can it really be and ordered it on demand on cable.  I am writing this review to warn everyone - with this movie it honestly is not a matter of opinion, the movie is just plain terrible.  I don't get how people are going overboard criticizing the acting for there is very little for any of the actors to do.  I blame this disaster on Oliver Stone and him alone.  He is obviously trying to make a statement on money, its business etc.  No point is made and there is no story.  All the actors walk through each scene like zombies for the entire script is ridiculous.  There is no emotion for the acrtors to grasp onto.  The scenes where tears are shown are laughable for they are so poorly written and directed.  With this movie there is no beginning, middle or end.  When it was finally gratefully over I just felt like I had wasted 2 hours.  I had no idea what the point of it all was.  I really want to know what power Oliver Stone used to convince all these A list actors to participate in this terrible film.  He has created and directed a true mess.

I very rarely write such negative reviews but I must be honest and feel people considering watching this film or even God forbid purchasing it should be warned.

In the first book, Dons quirkiness (somewhere on the Aspergers Spectrum) was a major player in the book, but it wasn't the only player.  The other characters seemed to have more to contribute.

In this book, Dons behavior seems so forced and so contrived.  Every single thing he says and does is tainted with his quirkiness, to the point of absolute annoyance.

For example, a woman is about to breast feed her baby.  Here is the quote from the book:

The discussion was interrupted by the arrival of a nurse carrying a baby which I assumed was Sonia and Daves.  I was well aware from the Antenatal Uproar that social convention took precedence over maximizing immunity through the sharing of breast milk.

Sonia commenced the nutrition and immunity-improving process.

I can also say I have learned a few things from her books if you no what I mean, and if you have read her books than you do no what I mean.  I think my problem with this book was it read like a young new adult book.  These characters could have been 20 or 21 instead of 28 and 36 years old.  I really did not like Jake.  He came off like a frat boy having sex with everyone.  I mean he's 36 or 37 I think, way to old for his behavior which came of creepy to me.  I also didn't like that he had sex with some random girl after meeting Presley. I  Know they were not going out, but I still don't want to read that.  As far a Presley I really didn't like her either.  The way she talked was almost like a biker chick from one of the MC books.  I couldn't understand why she was allowing her 2 guy roommates to be having orgies in her living room, if it bothered her that bad.  And last but not least the language.  I hated the crass use of profanity.  It was almost like it was being used for no reason.  For me it was a turn off.  I still love this author and will continue to read her books.

The intriguing idea is two dopey teens poking around an abandoned mental hospital discover a naked girl chained down to a table who isn't alive.  But she's not exactly dead either.  But she's hot, for a zombie.  And naked.  You can see the possibilities coming but the film doesn't decided whether it's a horror film or a comic horror film.

In fact, the script doesn't make a lot of decisions that help with the great idea.  Why couldn't the more thoughtful teen dig through the lab to find out who the girl was and how she ended up chained to a table?  The writers indulged the scumbag teen who uses the deadgirl for his own gratification but left the other teen thinly developed and weak.

I admire the filmmakers for independently creating a vision...but the vision wasn't prepped enough to become a professional horror film.  Characters aren't developed, ideas aren't followed through, good ideas are thrown in but then left incomplete.

Better than most of the ""horror"" crap I've seen (certainly more interesting than more popularly-distributed films like HOSTEL or whatever torture porn is hitting the multi-plexes) but...just not there yet.",1,"[1.4538641346804213, 1.6997163815138412, -0.5754762154552732, -1.0838244192500772, -2.1575318246408397]",1.6997163815138412

Now, he fails not because of the patriotics, the stupidity, the cliches, whatever... he fails because he wrote a bad screenplay, and obtained half-hearted performances by his lead actors.

9371,"I had to see this movie in L.A.  I had to see how a politically-correct crowd of west coasters would react to the onslaught of crude humor in TEAM AMERICA.  There were gasps, but there were a lot of laughs (I saw it in Santa Monica).  The house wasn't full, but I realized that this movie will probably do better when it hits DVD and the stigma of being seen going to it won't be as bad.

Kind of like porn.

Like some of their best stuff, the creators of TEAM AMERICA are very hit and miss.  But when they hit, it's into the stratosphere.

Rarely have I seen a movie that manages to make fun of so many things to so many people.  There's bound to be at least one thing that will offend anyone reading this, but you'll probably have a couple really hard laughs at other scenes.

They've taken the ridiculous medium of puppetry (remember the THUNDERBIRDS from childhood?) to play out a brainless Hollywood action film, but they've also satirized the brainless Hollywood A-list of celebrity/activists (including ""the greatest living actor of all-time, Alec Baldwin"").  The constant barrage of bad language detracted from the overall film--but these are the mind behind ""South Park,"" so there you go.

I have a feeling the film will be more successful as a DVD: everyone's curious to see what was left out the first time around--especially of that notorious puppet sex scene!",1,"[-1.4622978593214817, 1.5353375949686183, -1.4763618964442629, -1.0705652562702714, -1.1279930191032879]",1.5353375949686183

While some of the topics are pretty graphic and ugly, none were gratuitous. The writing was okay but I think the author will continue to get better and better.  She has amazing insight into some pretty terrible things, and handles them very well because there is pain, sorrow and heartache that shouldn't be trivialized. Some things I did NOT like were a lack of realism in things like the hero knows it is unbelievably dangerous for his woman to be going out but he lets her go somewhere with only another woman with her, a woman whose loyalty he questions?

Basically, Easy A beat them to the punch with a better cast and script.

Throw in the odd choice to place the movie in the '90s yet a lot of it looked more like the '70s was bizarre. Seriously, most high school movies are in the now as it's teenagers who watch this fare by and large. Unless I'm missing some untapped group of people in their late 30s who want to relive the '90s?

1. There's too many characters, and though they all intermingle eventually, you just can't keep track of all of them and their relations.
2. I can never feel for any of the characters. There's nothing there but how they handle situations. No feelings, no thinking things through. No emotions. I don't know what to think of any of them.
3. They're just plain boring. That's the only way to say it. The plots start off okay, but they just float away to other things that are of no importance that are distracting.
4. The romance is so vague. It's hardly there. No sensuousness, no passion, no nothing. It's just flat.

296,"I've been actively avoiding the New Adult genre up until now. Seeing as I only started reading Young Adult books two years ago, I really shouldn't be so genre-snobbish - I mean, surely New Adult books can't ALL be ALL about sex, right?

So I was hesitant to pick up Losing It. I actually objected to the whole synopsis, right from the beginning. I'm not going to preach on about how girls should consider their virginity a treasure blah blah, because (and yes this may be TMI!) I didn't. However, the fact that Bliss is still a virgin and seemingly suddenly decides to find a random guy to 'lose it' to didn't really sit right with me. And in fact, in the opening scenes of the book, she seems to keen to get it over and done with, I wondered why if it had been bothering her so much she didn't do something about it sooner....

As the story progressed, I came to like Bliss a lot more than I thought after my initial impression. She's funny, awkward and more than a little confused about exactly what she wants in life, love and her career so she's very easy to relate to. I did think that Garrick was sweet and a genuinely nice-guy, but I didn't actually feel that character crush moment - perhaps having an English boyfriend myself has made those British accent's a little less enthralling ;).

There was the expected and inevitable drama and misunderstanding, and some turmoil and sneaking around with the whole professor / student relationship which did feel like it wasn't taken all that seriously and some passionate and well written intimate moments (man I feel old calling make-out / sex scenes 'intimate moments!).

Losing It isn't completely predictable, but it didn't set my world on fire either - it's the kind of book that I enjoy when I don't really want to have to think about what I'm reading or struggle with emotional or moral dilemmas Overall this was a fun read, and I breezed through it pretty quickly.

621,"This should really be a 3.5-star review (which, by the way, is the current ""average"" rating on Amazon as I write this), but Tom Perrotta is a serious writer and I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.

I've never read anything of his before, and I suppose it was the science-fictiony aspect of this book that intrigued me enough to read it.  It's an interesting premise, and Perrotta executes it nicely, with a soupcon of satire/sarcasm for religion and suburbia, among other things.  In the hands of someone like Lionel Shriver, the book would have been far more biting and negative and more of a challenge to get through; I'm grateful to Perrotta for that, because I find each of Ms. Shriver's books harder to take than the last one.  For one thing, even though he pokes fun at just about everyone in the book, he seems to like each of his characters in some way, even if it's just a little bit.  (In contrast, Shriver's books remind me of the old Tom Lehrer lyric ""and I don't like anybody very much"".)  In other words, there's a sweetness to the book that is endearing.

Is it a great novel or great literature?  I don't think so.  Will I read any of his other books now?  I don't feel particularly drawn to them - I've read enough satires of suburban life, religion and so on that I don't feel the need to read more of that.

Beyond the fact that it was rather formulaic, which many books are these day, but it didn't really do anything to make this formula of a story stand out from the others.  If anything it bored me.  I found myself frustrated with the characters lack of communication (I hate when that is the sole reason a couple has issues) and found myself skimming a large section of the book.  Even with skimming I didn't finish the book as quickly because I kept putting it down.  I lost interest in the characters as a couple but still wanted to know how things would end. Funny enough the epilogue was the one part of the story that I did not skim and was intrigued by.

Liese and Ryder just did not feel very three dimensional to me. I wanted to learn more about them but never felt like I did and that resulted in a missed connection.  Supporting characters worked well, even the stalker issue that came up.  However, the way that issue ended was very abrupt for me and a little unfinished.

For me there was a lot of potential here but it just fell short.  The plot could have been developed more, the characters even more so.

While the storyline is excellent once again, the quality of the writing seems to have dropped off 10% to 20%.  The prologue contained superfluous backstories and used the word ""rankle"" twice within a page and a half.  One rankle per novel, please.

As other readers have noted, some of the grammar and syntax was confusing to the point that some sentence structures were unreadable.  Someone should have proofed this novel a bit more.  You can't blame the author for not seeing all of his own mistakes, but someone should have.

Other than that, it was an enjoyable read and I've moved on to the third novel.  It still has some grammatical issues, but not quite as many as the second novel.

Some of the battle ballistics didn't seem very ""newtonian"", but I read the novel quickly, so they might make sense.  I do believe that the effects of deceleration may have been confused with acceleration.

But, it's worth the read if you like the first novel and the saga continues in a very good fashion into the third novel.

They are SO unique and fabulous!  Permilia is one of my favorite characters, and I know I continue to say this about Jen's heroine's, but each one is as good, if not better, than the last!  Strong, brave, and independent, Permilia is highly entertaining since you really don't know what she's gonna do next! ;) (I also personally felt there were touches of Anne in her personality) Then there's Asher.  A true gentleman, and when it truly counts he comes through!  And those sub characters?! :D  I ABSOLUTELY CAN NOT WAIT for the next book!!!!  And I most likely will be LONGING for it all the way to November of this year!!!!! ;)  I love all of these quirky characters from the top to the bottom!  I love the details, the dialogue, and the dangerous suspense!  I love the Faith scenes!!!  I just love this book (and really any book from Jen)! :)  This is a great start to a fantastic new series and I HIGHLY recommend it!!!

Just a day ago I read a book that brought out raw emotions, I cried a lot. I read through the tears. But this book, this one was all together different.

Making Faces, is about facing ones own demons and finding that beauty is beyond skin deep.

Amy has a way of using the bible to teach us there is so much more out there, something greater than us.... God.
She does it in a way that you catch the meaning & the lesson behind it without it sounding preachy or in your face.
Love heals all, forgiveness sets us free.
I love the honesty of her books.

I'm not gonna lie, I didn't just cry....  I bawled my eyes out! I felt the sadness, I felt the loss and I felt the love & the strength to breathe again.

Lauren Layne is my number one author. She is my go to girl when I need to read a good book. You know, when you are in a rut and want a GOOD book??? Lauren is it for me. She is my spirit animal. My soulmate. My fav. She is it for me.

Someone Like You had me giddy and wiggling all around when I read it. When I was reading the book, Adele was playing in my head. I was signing her version of ""Someone Like You"" and thinking, this book is as good as the song!

I feel in love with Lincoln the second the book started. Swoon!! He is my everything wrapped in one. He is sensitive and sweet and handsome and sarcastic all rolled into one !

Then there is Daisy. I can't not think of one bad thing to say. She was awesome in her own rite. When you put them together, you have something special. Alone, they are good, together they are better. See, each of them has their own past (but don't we all) and when they become friends, they complete each other. Friends turned lovers is one of my favorite type of reads. So this one was a win for me!!

Thick pages with Very detailed pictures. I think this book could last you a year. Some of the pictures are so detailed they will take several days to finish - I like that!

There is also a bit of the story in here as well. But you wouldn't buy it for the story, it is mainly a coloring book, and an awesome one at that!

I have quite a few adult coloring books now and I think this is my favorite so far!

3031,"I always enjoy a Baldacci story and this is no different. A few readers were disappointed, I was not. Yes I prefer some of his books more than others but this is common among most authors I follow. One reader said it is slow and boring, I couldn't put it down and thought it moved at warp speed. I do agree that there are many twists and turns, some rather far fetched, but decided to sit back and just enjoy them. I don't expect all fiction to mirror real life.  This is not a police procedural, just a good story. I liked all the primary characters, liked the wrap up and for those who feel they wasted their money, try using a library next time, then, if you don't like the novel, you can just return it rather than grousing about money spent.

I also thought for a 18 year old girl who was supposedly so sheltered to have 3 sexual partners she just didn't come across that sheltered or innocent.  I new going into the book from the plot it was probably going to be a little different but just not that annoying.  I mean by the end I really didn't care if they ended up together or not.

The struggle to get this book to the publisher shows in every chapter of clunky plot devices and hackneyed story lines. The fact that ""Eric left some stuff in a closet"" became a painful lynch pin of the action shows how little Harris cared about the quality of this book.

572,"I'd flopped on a bed in a luxury hotel in Amman, Jordan last spring and flipped through a magazine, landing on page with little blurbs about about books.  I was intriuged by a couple of titles.  One was a book about the international sex slave trade (still not available in the USA until this fall) and the second was IF ON A WINTER'S NIGHT A TRAVELER.

The little blurb said this book had ten Chapter Ones.  You read that right.  One book, ten first chapters.

I wrote these titles down and ordered the latter after I got back home.  And I just finished it.  Wow.

I won't try to explain everything that goes on in this book but I can tell you--and this was the part that really surprised me--I was able to follow it all.  Even when I suspected about two-thirds of the way in that my attention would waver and I'd lose complete track of this strangely-written book, I still knew what was going on.  I have to chalk that up to the writer.  I've gotten lost in far more conventional stories after wading through thick and ponderous writing...but not this one!

This is a book about books, about reading, about the solitary existence of readers and the fantastic journeys they find on pages.  The writing is particularly strong and I wonder how much credit the translator should receive.

I can sit here and say this book didn't make me feel, but that would be a big, fat lie because, oh did it. My heart shattered and my emotions were all over the place.

Natalie Gilcher is happy and content. Shes married to her high school sweetheart and shes pregnant. Her husband Aaron, is away on a convert mission overseas and is expected home really soon. Being a NAVY wife, Natalie knows the protocol and she experiences firsthand the dreaded moment that no person should ever be a part of.

That knock at the door.
Aaron is gone and her world is shattered.

Natalie is dead inside and only lives for her daughter, Arabelle. Shes alone and not even the comfort of her friends and family can pull her out of the void she feels.

Then we meet Liam Dempsey.
Liam is Aarons best friend. He comes into her life and spins her world upside down. The more time spent together, the more they feel attracted to one another until they can no longer deny what they feel.

Oh Liam *sigh*. Dreamboat is beautiful, a NAVY Seal, sweet, swoony, sexy and protective. He loves Ara and hes absolutely PERFECT!! Natalies strength saves him. Shes that light he needs, the one he can look forward to when he goes into battle.

Together Liam and Lee endure loss and pain. But they fight and they overcome the ghost of Aaron. They love and feel, and there wasn't one moment they weren't respectful of Aarons memory.

This story taught me that sometimes its pointless to fight the strong feelings. That sometimes you just have to take the bull by the horns, so to speak. But most of all, that its okay to believe in love again.

1847,"A difficult book to read and significantly more difficult to review.  The difficult part of reading and reviewing was the struggle to suppress my own emotions.  The writers attempt to reveal the mistreatment of Muslim women in particular is noble.  Her life story is one of many emotions, trials and tribulations and the efforts on her part to seek equality on behalf of others reveals a great mind in a great person.  It should be fair to say there are many more like her stymied by their religion and background and yet of equal mind if not courage.  I say this because no single ethnic group or religious sect has a monopoly on brains regardless of gender.  Many people are simply what they are taught to be.  To avoid offending anyone I seldom discuss or give thoughts on religion.  I am not knowledgeable enough to discuss the various aspects of the various religions but like many (I suspect) I entertain my own thoughts and opinions.  While this book taught me some about the particular religion involved it made light of the brutality of life for women living under the justification by that particular religion.  I despise anyone involved in the mistreatment of women.  Certainly in my life I have known bar flies who maybe rated a dope slap but the constant abuse and mistreatment of any woman rates as a punishable sin.  I cannot always say they are the fairer sex unless by fairness one means their attitude and treatment of others, male or female.

The premise of the story had potential but I found the storyline actually was forgotten and lost. It was replaced with constant sex, that contradicted the characters backstories. Much of the prose was quite repetitive and i will say the word detonate now leaves a sour taste in my mouth.
Kian, the main character had merits in his protective and caring nature.
Brynn was an interesting character and I think she could have been so much more given her history and where she was coming from. Unfortunately, I felt she often contradicted herself with her actions given the fears she held.
Overall the story did not draw you in-- it was repetitive and the sex was filler rather than story.
The secondary character Sage and her backstory seemed like it was thrown in and didn't really go anywhere or make you really want to find out more about her.
There truly was so much potential to this story but it fell short. And honestly if an ebook is going to cost $4 it really should be edited. There were countless spelling and grammatical errors-- many of them affected how the sentences read.

Removing two stars because I've been hassled by telemarketers since the day they ported my phone number. I had ZERO problems with telemarketers before Ooma. Now I get constant scam calls. Two things: first, if you're on the do not call registry, they don't tell you this, but you need to sign up again once you port your number. Then, someone has clearly sold my info to telemarketers, and there's no warning of this, either. The only solution Ooma offers is to sign up for premier service to block the numbers-- so basically, now I would get to pay a monthly fee to fix a problem Ooma created. No. And the free call blocking program NoMoRobo doesn't work with Ooma Basic.

I called customer service about this and they promised to have a supervisor call me back. No one ever called me back.

Angry.

--
I thought this was too good to be true, but it's actually real. Setup was simple, the number was ported within a week, no echos or delays, and it's been reliable and clear ever since. I'm now paying less than $5 a month for taxes instead of the 35 or so that I was paying with my cable company. I can use it with my existing phone system and its built-in voicemail or use their voicemail, or both-- which is the option I'm going with-- my old phone system wouldn't kick over to voicemail if I was on the other line, but now it does because of Ooma. I didn't need any bells or whistles, so I'm not using Premium features, just the regular ole' service.

I thought the beginning of the movie where the two high school girls discover roller derby and where Ellen hangs out and meets her future boyfriend at that house party rang so true in a ""wonder of it all discovering life outside the boredom of Small Town America"" type of way.

I got tired of the constant explaining of the ""rules"" of roller derby and the Jimmy Fallon (seriously, Jimmy Fallon?) arena-side announcing was just unnecessary.

The story follows the typical Hollywood script--girl meets roller derby, roller derby meets girl, girl meets boy, boy goes on tour with band, parents get angry she is secretly roller derby-ing, crying and anger ensue and in the end all is forgiven and everyone sees the light (bar the stereotypical sensitive alterna rock boyfriend).

Anyway, for what it is it's just OK. It could have been far better and in a way Kansas City Bomber with Raquel Welch is far superior (and I am being both literal and sarcastic on that note).

I chose the brown color. The wallet is  made from very thin material and , yes, there is a crinkling sound when the wallet is opened and closed or the bill separator flap is moved. I don't see this to be an issue and just people nit-picking. I've only had the wallet a day or so and it is holding my stuff firmly in place and I don't see anything that would indicate the wallet is fraying or coming apart..., yet.
Now, this wallet is definitely overpriced by about $10-$12 dollars in my estimation. It does feel cheap and I guess the RFID blocking works. I have no easy way to check. I did receive an email asking me to give the wallet a 5 star review for reasons I find unworthy and objectionable.
This is not a 5 star wallet if all factors are considered. I 've had expensive wallets from Italy and this is not in the same class. My review is taking into consideration the price, workmanship and what it is supposed to accomplish with RFID blocking.
In conclusion, the material is thin and the wallet feels cheap and the price is high. On the other hand, I think t was the best pick from the Amazon RFID wallets. I don't expect this wallet to last more than one year at the high end.

1131,"It seems from most of the reviews posted you either hated this novel or loved it and can;t understand why anyone would bash it.  Let me explain why you would bash it.  It's not that good.  Don't get me wrong, it's not terrible, but it's quite a dissapointment when you think 'hey, isn't this Palahniuk?' and just can't believe that he put his name to it.  If it were any other auther, it may be good, maybe even great, but not when you come to set standards for the authers writing.  I happen to have high standards for Palahniuk because most of his work is just utterly mind-blowing.  I think the problem here is that you wait for this explosive ending (Lulliby, Fight Club) and you end up getting something that just sparks.  It's like waiting for a fireworks show and getting some cherry-bombs and a bottle rocket.  It's just now what you wanted.  The story has potential.  You have a comotose man who, before going under wrote a buch of creepy things in peoples homes all over this island and now his wife is having to clean it up as well as try and decipher what he means.  The only thing is, even if the ending is kinda surprising, it just isn't written well.  It leaves you wishing Chuck had explained a little more, or at least a little differently.  It's not the worst book ever, it's just not as satisfying as it could, would and should be coming from Chuck.  Read it if your a fan and want to read all his work, but save it for later...read his other work first.",1,"[-1.155597134581256, 1.1094216496581744, -1.2386356946000625, -1.0642238725378779, -1.1944050082725488]",1.1094216496581744

2506,"The first graphic design error is choosing a red border for a book of black and white photographs.  The red is extremely distracting from the image, and borders every single spread.

Another major mistake is the layout of the photos themselves.  The full spread images are spliced in half by the binding, some are also split into sections of nine for no apparent reason, and others are split into sections of 9 with different sized photos taking up different segments.  I'm sure he thought he was being edgy, but it breaks too many visual rules.  It's extremely distracting and makes it hard to focus on any of the images.

All of the images seemed like third world street photography and seemed like they could have been taken anywhere.  While it was interesting to see the wide variety of ethnic groups that live in the area, there wasn't a cohesive story or enough information to carry the images and they didn't speak for themselves.  The descriptions were very brief captions, and for a several hundred page book, the brief essay at the front and little captions wasn't enough.  I wasn't really sure what mattered about the images I was looking at and it seemed like anyone who went there could have taken the same images.  There wasn't anything remarkable about them, other than it was a place not many people in the US travel to.

I'm also a photographer and it seemed to be like the book might have been shot in black and white film.

7762,"I have to wholeheartedly recommend this crevice tool for vacuum hoses.  In essence, this is just a cheap tube that you insert into the hose of your vacuum. For me, I had to force it in, but it did ultimately fit. I worked it into the lint filter opening of my dryer, after removing the lint screen. I am hyper-vigilant in clearing out that screen, but I always worry about a build up of lint inside the machine. As I worked with it, I could hear ""clumps"" of lint going into the crevice tool. At one point, I had to cut off the vacuum because so much went in that it clogged the narrow opening of the attachment! I removed it from the vacuum and had to use a blunt tool to loosen the clog and knock out the rest. Immediately, I emptied the canister of my machine, and there was a good deal of lint. I know that it was not carpet dust that had been there before, because it all had a very strong perfume smell of detergent and softener.

To be sure that all the dryer lint was removed from the attachment, I carefully ran water through and stood it upside down overnight to drip dry. I ordered this thinking I was just taking a gamble on something that probably would not work at all, and to my delight it works perfectly. I am going to use it repeatedly until I am certain that no clogs remain, and then I'll switch to general maintenance.

For some reason the subtitles on the second movie didn't work for me and I couldn't find where to turn them on. First and third movies the subtitles worked fine. I was a little concerned when I started the third movie as it started up as full-frame, apparently that disc has both versions on it.

This book just wasn't engaging me.  I cant exactly pinpoint the reason, but I think it has to do with some sloppy story telling.  Man!  How I hate to say that about one of my favorite authors!  But there were things in this story that just didn't make sense to me.  In most cases, I find Jill Shalvis to write smart stories.  This one had too many holes for me.  This is the peril of reading a favorite author from their earliest stuffsometimes you're going to get some not so stellar stuff.

I actually adored the hero, Noah.  I think it would have helped to have actually relived his issue that kept his grounded for 6 months.  It would have given me a deeper connection to him and a better understanding of his frame of mind.  Once I knew what he had been through I did feel bad and sympathize for him, but I felt a sort of disconnect from the event since Noah doesnt even really have flash backs or anything.

The heroine, Bailey, was likable but I didn't love her.  Ive seen some reviews saying shes an idiot.  I don't think thats true.  Thats where things come back around to plot holes.  I don't want to give anything away, but since when do people not look behind artwork for safes?  Theyve been doing that since the dawn of time (or the popularization of houses and safes anyway).  That was one of my biggest issues with this story.  Bailey wasn't doing anything that the goons who were after her couldn't have done without her.  Silly.

One of my pet peeves was played out in this book and Im sure that had a lot to do with my disinterest in it at times.  The constant withholding of important information to protect other people, talking in circles, trying to take a huge task on alone when its obvious that impossible.  Over and over and over.  It was too much!

The author must have done something right along the way though because I am interested in reading about what happens with the rest of the people at Sky High Air.",1,"[-0.40291131588562945, 1.06183130174263, -0.8177110351931807, -1.0609854600717799, -2.079006447169947]",1.06183130174263

Watching these two navigate around one another and deal with the issues that Olivia is hiding was amazing and so refreshing to see a twist that I had not come across before.

4551,"""I have so much love inside of me thats all yours, and its been trapped inside. I need to give it to you, because holding it in is killing me.""

Once again, we have been allowed to enter the unique world of Penelope Ward. Sins of Sevin offered us a read of epic proportions that told of a love never intended, that led down roads undefined, and created paths that only few could possibly walk.

Nothing thats worth it comes easy. But when the payoff comes, it can be spectacular.

Love is beautiful. Watching two people fall in love is breathtaking.  Listening to their talks that bring them closer together makes us fall even harder for them. We cheer for them, laugh with them, and cry with them.  But we also must come to terms with their predicament and positions in life.  When we enter into Sins of Sevin, we cannot possibly be prepared for the depths that this story will take us, and the place in which we will be left in the end.

""You're my truth. Everything else is a lie.""

Sins of Sevin was such an emotional read.  Told in first person, dual points of view, leaving this book I was in a haze.  My heart and mind were so full, but at the same time had been completely emptied and left on the pages of Sevin. It was breathtakingly beautiful, but had a level of pain, remorse, and dwindling hope that made my emotions stretched.  I physically had a need to hold onto something in order to steady myself along the way.  There was so much depth and complexity represented in the story line and that followed into the characters. As usual, Author Penelope Ward established some wonderful secondary characters. One of these made me laugh so hard, and the other caused my heart to swell.  As every chapter and scene changed, I was so pulled in that I easily followed, feeling as if I were a bystander watching and listening.  Sins of Sevin is not only at the top of my taboo list, but also worked its way into my top 5 reads of 2015.

You cant choose love.  It chooses you, and once that happens, it doesnt let go.""",4,"[-3.2080937830447622, -2.4858068501317963, -2.3130474940111236, -1.060134887700066, 1.057095164395794]",1.057095164395794

There are a few truly laugh out loud scenes and jokes - I love the entire scene in the car explaining why George Michael is legit tough guy music.

I was really disappointed.  I found both Sed and Jessica incoherent,  badly written characters who were impulsive and fundamentally uninteresting.  Anyone who likes to have sex with famous people in public,  can't be devastated if it's caught on video.  Jessica seemed to have no ability to project into the future.  It would absolutely harm her future in corporate america if she worked as a stripper,  but still,  she did it. It would absolutely make a difference to her law school if a sex tape came out,  but still she kept putting herself in situations where it was almost inevitable.  Sed and Jess loved having sex with each other but didn't understand each other at all,  and by the end I was happy to leave them

I will not buy the next in the series.

But with that said, the 2nd half of the novel is confusing, at least to me.  It wasn't that I didn't enjoy it because there were a number of characters who come along in the 2nd half that I really liked and the dialogue is especially good.

I just had trouble keeping track of what was going on.  That may be my limitation, but it still seemed like the 2nd half was trying to do too much and felt it lost some focus.

Each day starts out by putting our focus on the reason were celebrating  the birth of Jesus and the change He makes in our lives. The Scripture and devotional then leads into the history of a Christmas hymn, along with the printed lyrics for our reflection. Each day ends with a seasonal craft or gift or recipe to make at home.

My favorite part of this devotional is the hymn histories and lyrics. I think sometimes we become so familiar with certain songs and carols that we sing them without really thinking about what the words mean. Allowing myself to stop and reflect on what Im singing, on the true impact to my heart of words such as So God imparts to human hearts / the blessings of His heaven or Good Christian friends, rejoice / with heart and soul and voice / now ye need not fear the grave / Jesus Christ was born to save!

Bottom Line: The whole book is excellently done and very sweet. Tons of great gift ideas that will pamper the people you love and give your presents a heartfelt touch, not to mention the yummy recipes I cant wait to try!

521,"Another amazing chapter in the quest for the tower, A long book I was struggling to find time to read this but couldn't wait till I could pick it up again. This book came with me everyday to work in the event I found a few minutes of down time so I could read even a few pages more.

The beginning of this book picks up right were the previous left off. In Wastelands we are left with quite a cliffhanger and I was so glad to already have Wizard and Glass so I didn't have to wait. From the first page I was thrust into the action and adventure with no chance to catch my breath. It was a great start.

After the resolution of the cliffhanger from Wastelands, King decided to take the reader on a journey into Roland's past. We get to see the fourteen year old boy who has just earned his guns and has been sent off on a mission by his father. The Youngest Gunslinger brings two of his friends witch have not quite finished their training or test of man hood, they are still apprentice gunslingers. As exciting as it seemed to finally understand why Roland is the way he is, I found myself bored at first.

This tale of Roland's boyhood took a little while to get going but looking back, it seemed absolutely necessary. It helped to get a feel of how the world was back when. Once the story introduced the players the fun really began. I found myself loving these new characters just as much as those King left behind to hear the story told by Roland.

In the sample, Sebastian Romanov is confident and used to being in control, but is tongue-tied when he first meets bakery owner Daisy Barnes and feels like he says all the wrong things.  Thats okay though because Daisy comes off witty and able to hold her ownin the sample. They feel an attraction to each other; the scene where they make lunch is cute and fuels the chemistry. The story has promisein the sample.  Then the story goes wishy-washy.  (Spoilers ahead)

Immediately into the purchased book, Daisy is an insecure naive wimpy mess.  She takes back her user loser ex-boyfriend and starts an email love affair with a man across an ocean.  Of course Jules, her perfect virtual boyfriend is really Sebastian pretending to be someone else for some ridiculous reason that Im not quite sure is given a suitable explanation because I started skimming for several chapters hoping it got better.  It does improve once Daisy and Sebastian hook up and their earlier chemistry is revived AND Daisy quits pining for Jules.  The romantic development in England is not bad once Daisy starts to get to know the true Sebastian.  The break up at the end and then hurried reconciliation felt a little forced and honestly just for added drama.

All in all, the author needed to get a better hold on the characters and firm up their actual personalities and motivations to make the story flow better. The email correspondence between Daisy and Jules is a snooze fest and takes up way too much time. (If you are thinking witty and sexy like FSG Ana and Christian, think again!)

1976,"This was an enjoyable conclusion to the Secrets of the Shetlands series.  It definitely helps to read these books in order.  It was interesting to see how the situation with Hardy was going to play out as he was accused of murder.  I liked how the new minister was introduced and what he brought to the story.  It was very cool to see Hardy's transformation and the minister's influence.  Learning more about what led to World War II was fascinating.  It was also exciting to see Winston Churchill enter the story!  I always love the rich history Michael Phillips brings to his books.  I liked the back and forth of Brogan and Emily's story in 1924 and David and Loni's story in 2006.  It was interesting to learn more about Emily's Quaker faith, and to see that it was as strong as David and Loni's.  I especially liked seeing how David treated everyone so well, even Hardy who treated him terribly, and what a witness he was because of that.  There's a little bit of romance as David and Loni are committed to each other and there's several other people forming couples in their sphere.  There were also several wonderful secondary characters.

These characters have a chance meeting and them go about their relationship 5 years later not knowing who the other is and frankly doing it kind of backwards but it totally works. The story line had the bit of crazy and dark thrown in with lots of passion,  hot sex, and some healing of emotional wounds.
Nik and Aimee have kind of an unconventional meeting and start to everything but it totally works for their story. I loved how everything between them unfolded and they heal each other. As a reader its awesome to see a character heal and become whole throughout a story. Nik is a typical sexy alpha male who is determined to keep Aimee safe. He has a lot of guilt and emotional baggage that hes closed himself off from for so many years but Aimee helps him with all of that. She is a great person.

I liked the beginning of the book, with pregnant Tessa approaching cowboy undersheriff Dillon, thinking he was his twin brother Ethan.  So far, so good. But things went downhill quickly from there.

I wish the storyline had just been Tessa's story and this had been a straight romance rather than romantic suspense.

They definitely balanced each other out and watching them, especially Christine, deny their feelings for each other was fun.

As far as the writing goes, this would probably be one of the better ones from Alberts. Ive always been content with her books. I don't overly love them, but I don't dislike them. Theyre just okay for me. This one, though, I think with the overall plot and background characters, I really liked how everything worked out.

1959,"Roseanna White is skilled at penning historical fiction! I enjoyed the Scottish elements of this particular story. The haunting setting...the clash of classes and loyalties...the interesting discussion of curses and whether or not they truly pose a threat. It's a good blend of intriguing descriptions, a compelling and varied cast of characters, and a fairly unique topic and backdrop for the genre.

The poor heroine endures some awful trials and difficult changes in this story. But the Duke of Nottingham makes for a very tender and caring hero, which makes for a happy romance reader! The depictions of patient love as the story goes on are simply lovely.

As for the plot, my first impression was that the climax was a bit of a letdown, perhaps a bit rushed compared to all the build-up. But the build-up makes for an engaging read for the most part, and I feel like the conclusion is still satisfying, even if I got a bit bored toward the end and looked ahead to see what was coming.

The Reluctant Duchess is a well-written historical romance that's both sinister and sentimental in turn. And the finale definitely stirs up some curiosity for the third book in the Ladies of the Manor series, A Lady Unrivaled.

Violet McFadden, 34, lives a pretty ordinary life. That is until a little detour while running an errand one evening places her at the Grim Rock Distillery and into the sights of Sergio and Rocky.  But Violet is looking for a little adventure and excitement, and Rocky Duncan, 29, is looking for a book keeper at his not so friendly business. An exchange of self-defense lessons for some secretarial work puts them both on a new road.

Rocky is a bit anti-social, guarded, and intimating. Hes the type of guy you don't mess with, built and emanating an air of danger.

Violet isn't exactly your typical heroine. Quirky is probably the best way to describe her. While shes always been the wallflower and had a limited social life, shes far from bland or mousey.  At times shes a ball of contradictions, a bit of a plain Jane who knows cars and guns as well as a germophobe who shops at thrift store. A reader herself, she has no tolerance for BS misunderstandings in romance novels, and I liked that about her. But while Violet is pretty vocal and thus there is thankfully no BS misunderstanding break ups here, Violet could, however, stand to grow up a bit. She didn't always act her age, and while sometimes I found her humorous, other times I just wanted to tape her mouth shut.

Told via Violets 1st person POV but with the occasional 3rd person sections for Rocky, the story is pretty long and a thorough edit would make it more manageable as there were places I skimmed on descriptions. Also Violet repeats everything that happens to her best friend and mother and not only was it repetitive, but it also made Violet seem really immature.  After a while her mother and friend began to drive me nuts with how nosey and meddlesome they were.  Rockys friends were far more interesting and made an entertaining addition to the story.

All in all, the story has a lot of potential, but could benefit from some tweaking in certain aspects. My Dirty Detour is an original standalone romantic-comedy-suspense.",3,"[-1.615638081598513, -1.24663899556259, -1.021791137251361, -1.021002199518376, -1.862319425734957]",-1.021002199518376

The format also is original -- two narrators, one being the central figure from the pages of his memoirs, and the other, his editor.

630,"This linked series of short stories follows the residents of the town of Blackwell, Massachusetts from its eighteenth-century founding to the present day. Nestled in the Berkshires, the town has a legendary founding involving an intrepid pioneer woman, a bear, a girl who drowns in the river, and a red-soiled garden that causes all plants to grow with a scarlet tinge. Throughout the years the garden nurtures the lonely and the sensitive, and is ever so slightly magical.

In tone and form this books is quite similar to Hoffman's earlier Blackbird House. Both books follow the life of a town through the centuries, but The Red Garden is far less depressing, and many of the stories are far more hopeful. I found that this was a book best read in increments, not in a few sittings.

227,"In this moving true story of Madeleine Albright's past as a child growing up in Europe, readers get to experience her discoveries of her history through her words, many of them a shock to her, especially with her Jewish heritage.  In a way, Prague Winter is a voyage of discovery and with Albright's clear and honest writing style, readers are swept away by her prose.

This is the harsh story of a world that now seems unfamiliar to us, when a rising Germany controlled by a vicious dictator saw the fate of human existence in black and white, where only the white were allowed to survive in Hitler's mind.  As a child growing up in what was then Czechoslovakia, it is a heart-wrenching story in some ways, as Albright tells it with skill and drama, mounting the tension that was very real, as she and her family left their home country for England.  But stories continued to unfold of what was happening back in their native nation.

Albright has clearly done a lot of research for this book, not just on her own family, but on the history and sources of the period, along with many photos from that time, it presents a thorough picture of this part of Europe during World War II and the rise of the Fuhrer.  It is also an insight into the culture of the Czechs, a people who do not bow down lightly and whose patriotism and culture is everything to them.  In some ways, Prague Winter reads like a powerful history book that would make great reading for any high school or college student wanting to learn more about the period; and at the same time it is a poignant biography of these people and of this child that was shaped into the incredible woman that she was to become.

2054,"`Gangs of New York' is definitely not a great movie, but it's not as bad as some have labeled it either.  It's certainly long enough, although with a film of this epic grandeur it probably could have used some more battle time.  The weakness in this film falls in the hands of lead actor Leonardo DiCaprio who fails miserably to command his role.  He lets Daniel Day-Lewis run away with the entire show, and run he does.  As Bill `The Butcher' Cutting, Day-Lewis is at his most charismatic and impressive, chewing up every ounce of scenery at his disposal, and at an almost three-hour running rate he has quite a bit of time at hand.

The film takes place in 1863 and revolves around Amsterdam Vallon (DiCaprio) as he strives to avenge his father's death at the hands of Bill Cutting.  Leo never quite develops his character fully and leaves the viewer a bit tired of seeing him.  The plot drags out a bit too much and I found myself growing bored unless I was watching Day-Lewis chew, chew and chew some more.  Cameron Diaz does well but the film has little use for her and it shows except for one scene involving a knife throwing scene with Daniel where their chemistry is bright and she makes good for herself.

This isn't, as I mentioned, a great movie but it's a decent one that has its share of good moments, most of which include the aforementioned Daniel Day-Lewis.  This film also sports a rich cast of supporting players like John C. Reilly (just love him) and Jim Broadbent and of course is rich and beautifully shot by none other than acclaimed director Martin Scorsese who proves once again why he's so well loved.  It's not a movie you'll hate, but you may end up scratching your head as to how it received 10 Oscar nominations, most shocking being that Best Picture nod that could have gone elsewhere.",2,"[-2.6227613894265276, -1.153339329037578, -1.3246180293068852, -1.0217929087245825, -1.4634448014970458]",-1.0217929087245825

I found his description of the embassy in Kinshasa of particular interest.  During my 30 years in the Army with 13 years overseas including a combat tour in Vietnam, I served as the defense attach at two embassies in Third World countries and was once caught up in a terrorist incident in Kashmir.
Greene employs great imagery.  One example is when he describes Countryside dark.  The kind of pitch black that can only be found beyond a citys limits.  Having been in places where there was no electricity, I could relate to this scene.  Another is when he portrays Mark Steele as part of the few who formed a thin hard line between order and chaos.
I appreciated how Greene focused on individual stories within the broader context of the epidemic.
One minor criticism.  The author uses the term soldiers when referring to Marines.  Marines are not soldiers. They are Marines and take umbrage at being called soldiers.  Just as we would not call a sailor a soldier or an airman a soldier, we should not call a Marine a soldier.

You will see a botched job of detective and police work done which contributed to the monster staying out of jail, despite committing gruesome crimes.
The book is about the crimes and investigations that are still ongoing.  The detail work by the writers is fastidious, but very frustrating, both to the writers and the readers.
Ultimately, one wishes for a resolution that didn't happen.  Knowing the monster is on the loose is disquieting.

I really liked the way that Maura's grief was dealt with in this book--both how the author wrote about Maura and the other characters' reactions. It was really well done. Jackson and Maura's courtship was perfect for both where they were in life and their history--I really enjoyed reading it. I was a bit disappointed with Sage's ""problem"", though--first, it was may to easy to figure out what it was, and second, I wasn't crazy about the person who ended up being the cause of it. It seems to take the whole small-town-everyone-is-connected-somehow bit just a tad too far. The solution at the end of the novel also has me torn--it could be a good idea, or it could cause waaaay to many problems down the road, but either way it deserves more than a minute and a half discussion in a hospital room.

1134,"Steven Pressfiled's The Profession, attempts to project 20 years into the future to a world largely dealing with the same issues as today, but relying on private mercenary forces. The tale is told through the eyes of a senior military commander, Gent, who has followed a charismatic general/leader as he traverse the top of the US military pecking order to a Douglas MacArthur style disgrace to finally re-emerge as the dashing Lawrence of Arabia style leader of the world's largest private army. Gent possesses the Semper Fi military creds and provides the fast paced, well described military encounters that carry initial two thirds of the story. Gent is gradually eased into a more back room, political making role that leads to disillusion as his commander transforms into a caricature of the Roman Empire in decline. The ending is less than satisfying with a grudging acceptance of a world changing for the worse.

For 20 years into the future, there is little in the way of progress. While the geopolitical complications of the Middle East are likely to remain, technology and warfare technology has barely budged from current day. 20 years of ongoing turmoil has done little to spur alternative energy sources and everyone is acting and reacting as today.

Ultimately Mallrats had a very uphill battle to overcome being the movie that followed up Clerks. The premise was simple. Two friends get dumped and go hang out at a local mall. From there hilarity ensues. (Historical note for those who care, the mall involved looks totally different after massive renovations).

The movie has been around long enough now that those who are likely to be reading this will know what the movie is like, so I am not going to go in depth on the movie itself. If you have only seen Clerks at this point, you will recognize some of that story put into this one, and even actors from Clerks playing different roles in this movie. That is the one thing you have to accept with Kevin Smith's movies. He uses a lot of the same people in his movies, but casts them in different roles.

THE MURDERERS DAUGHTER by Jonathan Kellerman, a standalone featuring protagonist Dr. Grace Blades, a dedicated and intelligent psychologist with a horrific past; two worlds collide  an intriguing psycho-crime suspense, with a strong mix of literary fiction.

Grace, 34, a highly regarded psychotherapist in L.A. Her therapy room is located in a 1920s English cottage serving as her professional headquarters on a quiet corner in West Hollywood. Grace had insisted on the ideal location so patients could enter on one street and exit on the other. She has a gift for treating troubled souls and tormented psychesand her own childhood tragedy.

Flashing back and forth we learn of a five-year-old- Grace in a trailer park, who lived with two strangers on the fringes a desert. Her biological mother and father were alcoholic drug addicts. There was a violent murder  a bloody suicide, and she is placed in foster care and later adopted.

Grace, now a highly intelligent psychologist, has a dark secret life. She enjoys one night stands with strangers. Turns out, one man (one of the hookups), Andrew becomes a new patient, traveling out of state to see her. (using an alias, of course). When she realizes he is from her past, and turns up dead, she now is in danger.

Now her professional life and past collide  a past she thought was behind her. Will her double life be exposed? Now Grace conducts her own investigating, pulling her back into the evil violent past, she thought she had escaped.

Grace, an intriguing damaged character a survivor, brilliant, intelligent, yet cold and dark, at times and detached. She possesses tenacity and is driven to solve the mystery--She has to face her demons from the past in order to have a future.

Due to Graces complex character, felt THE MURDERERS DAUGHTER was more of a deep character study, than a thriller, with seamless transition from past to present- Nicely Done.

949,"There are many things to love about this latest novel by Jodi Picoult.  I'm a fan of her books and have read all of them.

The story was compelling and gave me a lot to think about - in covers racism, white Supremists, a courtroom trial, a medical crisis, and a lot of heavy topics.  I found it very interesting that the attorney in the book - Kennedy - thinks of herself as  completely not racist but comes to see that she harbors some very subtle signs of racism.

The author often includes a ""gotcha moment"" near the end of her books....a surprising and plot-turning event that you don't see coming.  There was one in this novel, but it seemed far-fetched to me instead of a WOW turn in the plot.  I don't think it was really necessary.

At the end of the novel, there is a chapter that takes place six years after the trial.  It seemed a bit too neatly tied up for me.

My real concern with this book is the question I kept asking myself as I read it - is this story of pervasive racism (overt and subtle) REALLY the story for a white author to tell?  I actually had a conversation about this very topic with a bookseller in our local indie bookstore.  I likened the issue to a male writer penning a book about what it is like to be female.  Can that be done?  You can be empathetic and do research....but....I'm just not sure it is the same as living it.

But the book will keep your interest and make you think about some serious topics....not a bad thing!!!",3,"[-3.103049334398259, -1.1017455058016141, -1.161426010055567, -1.0229218741330492, -1.4487915996387226]",-1.0229218741330492

If you don't see the beauty in that, you may not fully appreciate how beautifully Cassella writes.
Reading Gemini for the last four nights has kept me looking forward to reading time and had me thinking of the moral issues the story invokes. I'd say that's just what a novel should do--entertain, intrigue, excite. But more than that, when I read a Carol Cassella novel I know I'm learning something, whether it's about the Olympic Peninsula and what it would be like to live there in poverty or about the deepest parts of a doctor's heart and how it feels to care deeply for a patient. This writer challenges her readers, not speaking down to us for a minute.
If you enjoyed the experience of reading The Goldfinch, The Husband's Secret, Gone Girl or any other recently read novel that was not only commercially successful but a story told beautifully, written with the highest regard for the English language and employing twists and turns to challenge the reader, I highly recommend you do yourself a favor and read Gemini.

When her best friend goes missing, she ups the moving date by two weeks and goes to the small town. Sunny doesn't know it, but she's moved into a community of were-shifters. They don't want humans in their small town. Especially one who arrives a couple of days before the full-moon-the only night of the month the shifters take their pure animal forms.

When Chav's younger brother, Babel Trimmel, (along with the sheriff, the mayor, and some other nice folks) suggest that Sunny take her U-haul and herself out of town, she refuses. Her psychic abilities are out of whack, blood makes her faint, but she's not a quitter. She refuses to leave till she finds out what happened to her friend Chavvah.

Sunny has more to deal with than the unfriendly townsfolk....disturbing killer visions, a dog-like animal no one else sees and that is stalking her every move. She's also finding Babel very irresistible too. (Babel is a younger Hugh Jackman wolverine).

But he also gives her his problems and secrets too... What I liked about this was the fact that everything still happens too fast and emotions happen like the next day BUT in situations like the ones they were in you get overwhelmed with the sense of attachment.. Jett is still seemingly perfect and I couldn't help but feel like Sylvie was crooked but she turned out to be a great best friend who had her own secret for the trip.. The OOPS factor is a bit much but now I have to get the third book to find out what happens.. Here's the thing.. I'm in no rush to buy it..

The Zone is suppose to have mythical properties as it has forces that can lure people to their demise, but also uncover our deepest desires.  Stalkers are the only ones who can sense mysterious forces and avoid the dangers within the Zone.  Many courageous people come to the Zone with stalkers as guides on quests to fulfill their wishes.  In this film the audience is to follow three characters, Stalker, Writer, and Scientist, as they venture into the perilous Zone.  The party's venture becomes a breathtaking journey through armed guards, obscure traps, and  psychological horror.  The journey can symbolically be interpreted as a pilgrimage in order to restore ones faith and hope, which have been lost.  This pilgrimage develops into a psychosocial battle between rationalism and abstract thought as the travelers attempt to reason with hope, faith, and love.

2091,"Dan Walsh has become one of my favorite authors, and I would put him at the top of my non-suspense author list, although he did write one suspense novel and it was a great read. I always look forward to a new book coming out from him, and I have been waiting for this one for several months, the fourth and final book in The Restoration Series.

  Book one centered on the parents in the Anderson family, and each book following has centered around one of their three children. This final one is about the youngest of the three, Doug, who is away in college.

  Although this book was not suspense, it was a fast read for me. Part of that was because I had been looking forward to reading it so much. The other reason I got into it so much is because I really enjoy prodigal stories, and this is one. I don't believe the authors call it a modern retelling of the prodigal son story from the Bible, but it very well could be. Son of a fairly affluent couple goes off to college and leaves his faith behind, falling into immorality and the wrong crowd. I knew Doug was going to hit bottom, and it was a bit painful to experience through the pages of the book, yet it was encouraging. The book had the message that even though we wonder from God, we can come back. He still loves us and will forgive.

  This is probably my favorite book of the series. They all resonated with me, as these are not light and fluff fiction, but books that carry a great message and has some great advice all through the pages for married couples and parents...... but I really needed the message of this book. That the same God who loves us and saves us is waiting to welcome us back and forgive us if we stray. I cannot say enough good bout this book and the whole series. Dan outdid himself on these four books, and Gary Smalley's expertise on family relationships is also seen in the plots of the books.

6792,"This third book in the Kill Devil Hills series might be called Pulled Under but really the whole series could easily be called Pulled In because thats what these stories dothey pull you in right from the start and keep you hooked up through the final page. And then some! Im sitting here right now ready for book 4, Adrift.  I don't even want to start another book because I want to savor these Kill Devil Hills characters a little longer.

So book 3 is about Rhett Morgan, Ellie and Noahs roommate introduced in book one, and Sydney Francesca Michaels, also introduced in the first book where readers caught a glimpse at their one night hook up that left Rhett drowning his sorrows and in a desperate hunt all over town for the girl whose name he didn't even know. Well it turns out Rhett and Sydney had more history than just that infamous night that made Rhett ready to leave his manwhore ways in the past.

In fact, Rhett and Sydneys past is actually pretty sweet and touching.  Despite Rhetts reputation, he shows a side to Sydney (and thus the readers) that makes him kind of a catch.  Im not sure the books blurb does Rhett justice at all as I came to adore him and certainly rooted for him to get his girl.

Without giving all the sweet treats of the story away, I will say the note thing was one of my favorite parts that really captured the romance.  But honestly the whole book kept me engaged and like the previous ones, I didn't want to put it down.

Sydney thinks shes using Rhett to get over her unrequited love for Ben Turner, but what she finds through the journey of the story is that Rhett offers what Ben cant.  Rhett intrigued me back in book 1, and he doesnt disappoint in his own story.  In fact, he definitely excelled my expectations.  Hes a great example of a character that is deeper than his reputation. Or as Rhett would look at it, hes offers so much than simply yellow snow.

At the end of the book the author indicates what was invented by him and what was factual, which I feel, is an excellent thing to do.
The book is about the idea of a state or states having the right to secede from the union. A group of Saints decide that this is their right from information they discovered which came from the writers of the constitution. The plot revolves around this Mormon group, the U.S. President and those working for the federal government who are trying to stop this effort. The ideas seem very timely and the possibility of secession seem very real. This was the greatest strength in this book. If you enjoy a thought provoking adventure/mystery, The Lincoln Myth is a good read.",3,"[-2.739832539888834, -1.3808967684292102, -1.529880531652189, -1.0241690727910968, -1.3771301239613738]",-1.0241690727910968

Walter Day has been missing for a year, with no clues as to his whereabouts, leaving behind a wife and four children.  Nevil Hammersmith lost his job with Scotland Yard because of rash conduct and now runs a private detective agency. Hammersmith has a brisk business, but his main focus is locating Day.

Grecian certainly knows how to create atmosphere and suspense. One important point of the story that Grecian handles well is the opening of a new department store in London, with people in awe of the store and all it offered.  The suspense kept me wondering what would happen next, and Grecian does an excellent job with setting, word choice, characterization, and other elements.

The main reason Im holding at a strong four stars is because previous background in the Scotland Yard Murder Squad series is almost essential.  Readers with no familiarity with the series would struggle to join in at this point.  This could be corrected with some front matter describing the characters and what happened previously in the series.",3,"[-2.2836806768288347, -1.0639440717668112, -1.584487733208904, -1.0242125315964292, -1.4672144212932843]",-1.0242125315964292

Despite the female being somewhat young she was portrayed as head strong and independent. Despite the cliche of the billionaire playboy character he was actually very well portrayed as hard working, caring and an emotionally stable individual. It was a story about a romance with realistic risks and demands. The book seemed more real than many of the other girl meets billionaire CEO and fall instantly in love stories. It was a refreshing read due to it sticking to more of a realistic view on relationship demands.

Rather than a legal case depicting the adversarial process, this is a fresh plot that just also has legal implications for the characters. There are two stories in this novel which are unrelated except to the extent that it permits the introduction of Charleston Story. She sets the stage for a moral and legal dilemma because of her roots. This will put all those she loves in the cross hairs of mobsters. The other story is reminiscent of Grisham's A Time to Kill. While interesting, their is little in the way of depth of character in that thread. It could have ben a novel on its own.

Review:

I totally enjoyed this story by ""new to me"" Author Stacey O'Neale.

I was very curious by the blurb to this story and picked it up for review.  I like the Earth Girls Are Never Easy part, it reminded me of the older movie.  That is the only thing similar between the two.  This is a more serious, action packed story where the movie was goofy.  To get back on track, this book held my attention from the very beginning.  Now, there are some funny moments, for example when Kaden and Bells go on their first formal date and Kaden researches formal dates online and ends up giving them a prom date.  I liked that the Author made them not totally acclimated to our culture and there is the funny mix up, like their first date, I think it makes it seem more realistic. This story is not super sexy hot, it does have some sexy scenes, but I would rate it a moderate on the hot scale.  I do think when Cam and Hilary get their own story it will be great, I really enjoyed these two characters and their one scene together left me wanting more of them. It did have some predictable moments, such as who the bad guy was, but it did not detract from my liking the story.  The story was interesting and different enough from others of the same genre to keep me reading and I was done very quickly with it.

Can't wait to read the next book!

498,"Let me start by saying that I generally love historical mysteries. They intrigue me and educate me about a time and place that I am not familiar with. I was looking forward to C.J. Sansom's ""Dissolution"", a mystery that takes place in a monastery during the English Reformation. However, the setting proved to be not my cup of tea. That being said, the book definitely has redeeming qualities.

C.J. Sansom has definitely researched this time period well, and his concluding historical note clarifies many of the points made in his book. It all begins in November 1537 when Dr. Matthew Shardlake, a lawyer working for Lord Thomas Cromwell in London, is asked to go to the Monastery of St. Donatus in southern England. One of Cromwell's commissioners, Robin Singleton, had been down there trying to negotiate the monks' surrender to Henry VIII. However, Singleton was found beheaded, and it is up to Shardlake and his assistant, Mark Poer, to discover who committed the heinous crime.

On the first night of their stay, another tragedy unfolds when a young novice, Simon Whelpy, becomes ill and dies a day later. The infirmist suspects poisoning, and the fact that Whelpy died before telling Shardlake about another possible murder leads Matthew to suspect that more is going on. Stories begin to circulate about a young woman working at the monastery who went missing a few years earlier, and there is the matter of the church being desecrated and a precious relic stolen.

It seems that the longer Shardlake stays, the more complex the mystery gets. What is truth and what is being made up to continue a way of life that may not be in the best interests of society? How much of the terror in London is real and how much was Cromwell's creation? Whom can Shardlake trust?

The book was interesting, and it definitely picked up toward the end. However, I can't give it five stars. Perhaps this is my own fault, as I learned that Tudor England doesn't interest me as much as I thought it did. C.J. Sansom wrote an intriguing novel, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.",2,"[-2.786325933487996, -2.0725470965287975, -1.822991746540503, -1.024683696427741, -1.102514549009434]",-1.024683696427741

2810,"This start to a brand new series from an author who knows just what a reader wants, is most definitely worth the hype.

The story started off hooking me right away, but slowed down almost immediately after Feyre was taken captive. Much of the first half of the book moves at a slow pace as the reader gets to know Tamlin, Lucien, and their home. A lot of in-depth world building brings Prythian to life and takes the readers imagination on a sensory-overload journey, whilst the same amount of time is spent on the slow-burn romance between Feyre and Tamlin.

The second half of the book was more to my taste as Feyre was given three harrowing tasks to prove her love for Tamlin. Enter Rhysand, the High Lord of the Night Court, and things really start heating up for Feyre.

I didn't always like Feyre and found her too proud and headstrong. She seemed to make a lot of purposely stupid decisions, risking her own safety for nothing. But she really redeemed herself in the second half of the story. She was put to the test again and again, and with every blow she had to endure, my liking her increased.

I think Rhysand was a great addition to the story, and although Im not a fan of love-triangles, this one had me undecided whether I want Tamlin or Rhysand to be the winner of Feyres affections. Oh, well, I guess Ill just have to wait and see whats going to happen in book two. The best I can hope for is that the sequel won't turn out to be an angsty tug-of-war emotionally for Freya when she has to make a choice.

If it wasn't for the hype and the persistent glowing reviews everywhere I turned, I probably wouldnt have read this book, even though I enjoyed Throne of Glass immensely.

646,"This book was so much different than what I expected. I certainly wasn't expecting a narrative told in separate connected stories (think: Olive Kitteridge, The Tsar of Love and Techno), that's for sure. It's a bold approach, and it works.

The back cover of the book does a pretty apt job explaining it: it's about aging punk rock record executive Bennie and his younger troubled assistant, Sasha. It's indirectly about them, at least. After starting off with stories focused on Bennie and Sasha as the main characters, the other stories are about people who knew them throughout their lives. Bennie and Sasha serve as the connecting thread that binds everyone together.

This kind of narrative is gutsy because you have to make sure a) each story is interesting in its own right while b) holding the reader's attention with so many different characters and c) maintaining enough of a connection to the central characters that it doesn't feel random.

Here, Egan succeeds on all fronts. With captivating characters and intellectually stimulating prose, she kept me fully engaged and eager to read each succeeding story. She even plays around with form in an exhilarating way; one story (one of my favorites) is told as a sort of PowerPoint presentation from the perspective of a young girl.

5272,"With all the confusion and uncertainties that comes with high school, Trust takes us on a journey of two people who survived a traumatic event with all the emotional scrapes and bruises such survival would leave behind.

I really enjoyed this book. The initial drama during the opening scene was written so well, I could feel Edies heart pounding, hear her struggling to breathe, and smell the fear in the air. I wanted nothing more than to get out of there.

I loved how these two characters came together in a rather organic manner first as friends, to lovers, to more. Despite being YA, the angst level was not extreme. There were some great secondary characters, plenty of fresh humor that never overrode the storyline, and even some steamy moments that felt true to a young girls first time.

This is my first Kylie Scott novel and Im kicking myself because I know I have some of her previous work already downloaded on my Kindle. I assure you, I will be pulling them from the TBR pile.

I liked how the author underscored that many of the characters were, indeed, very intelligent and savvy.  Sometimes Southern based books do not showcase this and that's a shame.  You wouldn't expect a part time mechanic named Bubba to be quite as sharp and proactive as our protagonist, but he teaches us a little something about his moxy and crime solving abilities.
I also liked that the true villain of the piece was not evident throughout the book.  I found myself formulating my own ideas about the killer's identity only to have them disproven time and again.
The ONLY downside to this book was its editing.  You see this frequently in the free and reduced offerings.  Spelling and grammatical errors in some books are irritating.  In this one they just made me sorry because this is SUCH a terrific book and it deserved a presentation that was as slick and enjoyable as the writing.  I would have given it a full 5 stars had it not been for the editing.

Title:  The Accounting

Rating:  4 Stars

I'm just now getting into Mystery/Crime/Thriller novels.  This book did not disappoint. After reading The Accounting, I will make it a point to back and read other William Lashner novels.

A teenage crime that everyone had long forgotten comes back to haunt Jon and his friends. A true tale of what is done in the dark, always comes to light even if its twenty-five years later. As the body count rises realizes one should never come between a drug dealer and his money. Jon finds out if a change in identity can save him from his past.

Normally, I can read a book of about two-hundred and fifty pages, in about three to five hours, depending on  the content. However, The Accounting is One BAB (Big Ass Book). It took me about a week to read this book. But none the less, it was a good one. As I settle in to read more of Lashner's work, I know I should probably read them on a cold, boring night, because it's going to be a while.",3,"[-1.9045402764584813, -1.2271170441636534, -1.5557660199369732, -1.0254525932574532, -1.1339139150900994]",-1.0254525932574532

Iyengar's view into enlightenment and freedom of all earthly possessions and desires. It certainly is not something I plan to pursue or practice any time soon, but it is good knowledge to have. He then proceeds to break down every yoga pose - or as many as can fit in this book - describing the technique, the benefits, and a rating of easy-difficult (1 to 60). Most semi-difficult poses are about an 8 so he is very ambitious. I do disagree with him on no inversions during menstruation, esp. when he provides absolutely no proof or reason. For a long time, I observed this as most yoga teachers preach it too but without any reason. My current teacher told me simply that it was a chauvinistic idea and to disregard it altogether. Inversions during menstruation are just fine, and unless proven or advised otherwise for a reason, I plan to do them. I am still plowing through rest of this book, and for now, it is at best a 3-star rating.",2,"[-2.625530082345354, -1.3766706601505294, -1.4761569848088203, -1.0254925097046212, -1.0468568289920224]",-1.0254925097046212

What an interesting life Douglas Preston leads! Like Prestons novels collaborative with Lincoln Child, this book cannot be put aside once you start on it. It will obsess every waking moment and haunt your sleep, so be ready for a totally absorbing read.

The White City of Honduras lived in legend for centuries. Charlatans and con artists claimed its discovery, indigenous people of the region feared its curses, and impenetrable jungle protected its secrets until 2012. And, perhaps it would have been best left undiscovered.

Like many ancient cultures, the tantalizing bits that have emerged about this one carry ominous warnings for the 21str century, and a few interesting lessons as the explorers face moral dilemmas that face us all time and again. This is truly the story of a trip to the heart of darkness and perhaps redemption.

He and his finacee (Rachel McAdams) are visiting her parents in Paris, and while she is interested in catching up with old friends in the city, he is taken by the beauty of Paris in the rain, and Paris at night. He laments the past and is enchanted by stories of the 1920s when the biggest celebrities spent their time in Paris nightclubs. One night, after lots of drinking, Gill goes for a walk, and a vintage automobile picks him up and transports him back in time where he rubs elbows with the most elite figures of the time, from the Fitzgeralds to Hemingway to Gertrude Stein to Dali and Picasso.

This movie has the easy sentimentality of many Woody Allen movies. One gets the impression that he writes for himself above anyone else, and that is okay because many can identify with his passions. This movie glamorizes Paris the way other Allen movies glamorize New York and it has the same winsome quality of The Purple Rose of Cairo.

This 110 page contemporary romance novella by Jeannie Moon is book #4 of a series called Royal Holiday.  Since I have not read any of the three preceding titles, which have been written by different authors, I do not know if this book ties into them.  With its second chance at love theme between Sofia, a princess of a very small European country, and her former college boyfriend turned FBI special agent Ian, the storyline revolves around Ian protecting her from terrorists bent on overthrowing her monarchy while she is visiting the US.  If you are looking for a sweet, quick read with a predictable HEA, you may want to consider this one.

2135,"I really wanted to like this book more than I did.  Patton was a great man and saw the danger that the Soviet Union posed to America while many politicians were Communist leaning and talked of friendly old ""Uncle Joe"", totally ignoring the fact that Stalin was every bit the brutal murderer than Hitler was.  He made plenty of enemies.  Maybe he was murdered.  However, while many questions are raised, there are no answers.  It is frustrating that 95% of this book is simply a recounting of the last couple years of World War II and the immediate postwar period.  Patton is simply one of many personalities described.  Relatively little time is spent on the ""accident"" because not much is known.  Questions are raised.
However, I must wonder about the accuracy of this tale.  One reviewer correctly stated that many of the facts given about Skorzeny are incorrect.  O'Reilly also states multiple times that Hitler was on the verge of getting a nuclear bomb.  This simply is not true.  His main nuclear scientist, Werner Eisenberg, wanted German science to survive the war, but was not a supporter of the Nazis.  He dragged his feet at every step and told Hitler that a nuclear bomb might be impossible and would, at least, be prohibitively expensive and take too many years to develop, even though he actually knew better.  Nazi nuclear research was minimal because of his deception.  If O'Reilly makes historical errors on these other issues, it makes me question that accuracy of the ""conspiracy"" around Patton's death.
Patton's prescience with regard to the Communist threat is certainly unappreciated, and may he would have been able to wake up America sooner to the threat the Soviets posed.  Lives might have been saved had he lived and convinced America of the threat.  However, his death may have been just an accident.  O'Reilly's evidence that he was instead murdered is minimal at best.
Better luck on his next ""Killling""",2,"[-2.2006316992285058, -1.101915380413198, -1.33530682984446, -1.0263906946198393, -1.2729469615347457]",-1.0263906946198393

In today's world, the material usually stems from Iraq or Afghanistan, although there re many other events in the world that could provide a stepping stone for a satisfactory thriller.

Colton grows from a ""carefree playboy"" to a mature man ready to settle down.  These two meet at the right time for each of them.

Jack is drawn into a kidnapping by simply sitting and drinking a cup of espresso while enjoying the sounds of New York.  He sees someone leave a car unattended in front of a fire hydrant, sees another man take the car and leave.  Not so mysterious, right?  But wait, this act leads to some very distinctly mysterious happenings,  A mercenary, Edward Lane, wants to hire him to find his wife, Kate, and stepdaughter, Jade, who have been kidnapped.  Several million dollars later, which Lane pays without blinking an eye, Reacher feels something else is going on.  Something is ""off.""
The journey takes him and his new temporary partner, Pauling, an ex-FBI agent-turned-PI down a twisted path of deceit, torture, and death.

I read For the Rest of Her Life by Ms. Moriarty as well, so I hoped I would like this one too! Not surprisingly, I did :) This book deals with issues surrounding divorce, and I'm always intrigued by how people handle it. Maybe its because I'm an attorney that works in family and divorce law, or maybe it's just because I know so many people that have gone through this. Either way, I enjoyed this story. Veronica tries so hard to accept her parents divorce and move on. But slowly, things start going wrong; she can't concentrate, she is having troubles with her boyfriend, and is falling behind in school. We can all relate with the problems she's having. But soon, her mom shows up at her dorm and desperately needs her help. Veronica doesn't really know what she can do, but tries anyways, because her mom doesn't have much after the divorce. Veronica is struggling with growing up, while her mom struggles to move past a divorce. It's an interesting story about a mother and daughters bond and friendship, I recommend it!

800,"I really didn't know what to expect when I received my ARC of this book even though it had a description of the book it wasn't a very detailed one. I was really surprised how much I liked this book. It starts with a pretty intense change from human to wolf that gripped me and didn't let go until the final page of the book. The main character, Jessica, was a woman that actually grew stronger as she learns to adjust to becoming the first female werewolf in the world. She started as an unsure girl, as anyone would be in such a situation, and doesn't hide the fact that she has no idea what's going on inside her. The secondary characters were well written and were interesting enough that I have hopes of either more to their stories written into the next couple books or even a spin-off series.

After eight years together, Chase popped the big question, but after two years never setting a date, he breaks off the engagement and moves out of Shelly's condo. A month later, he's shacked up with another teacher at the school that both he & Shelly work at.

Mel, Shelly's best friend since childhood, convinces Shelly she needs to move on. And who better to move on with than their good friend, Matty, who's always had a crush on Shelly. Matty understands that getting over Chase is going to be hard for Shelly since she's spent most of her adult life with the same person, but he's confident that he can get her to fall in love with him.

Throughout the school year, Matty & Shelly get closer and although they spend most of their time together, Matty doesn't want to rush Shelly, so he encourages her to go on dates with other guys. He needs her to be sure that she's over Chase and Matty isn't just a rebound. By the time winter break is over, Shelly's absolutely sure that what she & Matty have isn't just a fling.

Loved how the author tried to shake things up by trying something different, but between getting front row seats with the process, struggles, and development Jake went through when writing his book on top of the main storyline between Jake and Presley, I think the former overshadowed the latter a little too much.

Teenage narrator Danny and his older sister live with their father, a feral world of self-sufficiency. They don't fit into the community- Cathy's complaints of ill-treatment at school are dismissed: ""they're nice boys"". Daddy is a bare-knuckle fighter, huge, apparently a gentle giant to his children, yet with an inner requirement for brutality: ""your Daddy needs it. The violence. I wouldn't say he enjoys it, even, but he needs it. It quenches him.""

Under Umbrellas unfortunately ends on a cliff hanger, but it was nevertheless a really good read.  I have found that Emma Nichols' writing style really pulls at my emotions and this book wasn't any different.  I was upset over Blaine's callous disregard of Martha when she had a miscarriage and his even more callous announcement of filing for a divorce.  I felt all the angst  Martha experienced travelling to a new destination, where the only things going for it were the name, and the warmer temperature. I identified with her uncertainty as she started putting her life together in New Hope.  The love-hate relationship Martha and Joe embarked on was amusing and I could see how Joe was able to motivate Martha to stand on her own two feet.  Incidents throughout the book were hilarious, in particular Martha determination to operate a chain saw.  Joe's significant gifts to Martha were charming and made me realise the importance of celebrating milestones.  The small town mentality of New Hope was typical of small towns the world over.

Dirty is a book with a lot of humor in it. Sometimes, it's laugh-out-loud, otherwise it's the embarrassing kind, but you're still chuckling and then there are the ones that make you groan and laugh.

But let's talk about the story and the characters. We met the hero, Vaughan, in Deep. He was in the band that opened up for Stage Dive on their tours. Thing is, the band's broken up and Vaughan heads home, to a house that's been sitting empty, for a while now, with a lot of memories.

Now the heroine... Lydia was about to make the biggest mistake of her life but she ran away, before she did it. Man, certain scenes pissed me off so much but she's awesome, she takes crap from no one and stands up for herself. Of course, she could have done way more but that would have landed her into a lot of trouble so, it's better she didn't.

The way they meet is both funny and sad. Well, the circumstances are. Their chemistry is something you can feel, I mean Vaughan cannot keep his eyes off of Lydia and her chest. I loved the side characters and I cannot wait for book two.

Lately I haven't had the pleasure of reading a paranormal novel and I have to admit that I missed the mysterious and sexy nature of the stories. Both Bella and Jack as werewolves had such appeal to their story and I loved the fact that Bella was a painter and that Jack had a thirst for her work.

As for the plot it allowed the romance between Bella and Jack to grow. At first I thought this might prove difficult since the characters are from enemy clans. I was worried that the romance might get sloppy or unreal, but Miller knew the direction that she wanted her characters to go and the sensual attraction between the duo could not be ignored.

Arriving home he opens the device and finds that the content contains a top secret file and the Macbook belongs to a U.S. Senator.

  Will finds out who has Susan's computer and contacts Michael but fails to win his confidence.  In typical Joseph Finder fashion the plot thickens.  Criminal activities occur including the entrance of the group to whom the file belongs.  Action is fast and furious with Michael having to act quickly to prevent harm to himself, the company he owns and his family.

It's a very interesting collection of stories from Holmes and I enjoyed most of them. I wasn't entirely impressed with the first few short stories because they didn't capture my attention. However, that being said, they were still full of honesty and humor.

The last half of the book was much better for me. I really liked the stories and couldn't wait to keep reading more. I really think the one story told from the perspective of a dog was one of my favorites! Crazy, right?! I wasn't sure if I'd actually like that one because I've never read anything from an animal's perspective, but it was a lot of fun. The namesake of this book, Barbara the Slut, was another great story that I wish I had more of. I really liked her character and wish I knew how her life turned out! She's a fun girl! And the story about the law school graduate working at a sex toy store? So much fun.

Even though the first few stories weren't my favorite, I really enjoyed this book. It makes me want to pick up some more short stories and start reading The Art of Racing in the Rain (a book from a dog's perspective that has been on my shelf for too long).

Both characters are musicians, one of them living in isolation due to past emotional scars that have left him distrustful and broken. Despite that, he finds solace in the optimist piano player once she breaks some of his barriers after he rescues her from the wolves.

I think this romance is interesting, sweet, but the way they blurt their secrets in big chunks of confessions or songs felt a bit rushed or forced. There are hot parts when they get intimate, those were sexy. Suddenly, a twist in the plot brings some serious danger to the characters. That was surprising. Though I can't say that I ever felt too sorry for James, he's an arrogant man who thinks too highly of himself. I didn't like how he treated a prospective singer at all. And I don't know why exactly but I didn't feel a connection to the characters :-( They seemed a bit unreal to me.

The story is entertaining, of course. Secrets, surprises, betrayal, and the love of music all over the place. Even though the writing didn't move me, I think the story is original, hot and has many twists.

First Impression: Well-written, with a modern-age heroine romance readers can empathize and root for.

Jessica Jameson, a.k.a. Jessie James, is the outlaw of the publishing world. She has a number one New York Times bestselling book out right now, but behind the scenes, she's forced to spend time with her ex-one night stand, Grayson Reynolds, who also happens to be the new CEO of her current publishing house.  But Grayson wants to sell the romance division to another publishing company and he needs Jessie to agree to sign with the new company, not an easy feat given the animosity she holds for him.

Tamed by the Outlaw was a really fun read. I enjoyed the characters and loved returning to the Vegas romance convention setting. It's such a great series. Each story I've read in this continuity has been such an enjoyable read, and this one is no different. I loved the author's writing style, and how quickly she pulled me into the story and into Jessie's world. Into Jessie's problems.

I especially loved the dynamic between Jessie and Grayson. It's obvious from the second they are together on the page that they have some serious unfinished business between them, and lots of good old-fashioned, sparks-flying, chemistry. I loved that while they shared one night together, in which she had no idea who he really was, they've since switched to a sort of boss/employ, enemies to lovers dynamic. Which is one of my all time favorite themes to read.

Grayson Reynolds is a smart, crafty hero, but since he's working with the wrong mindset, his craftiness gets him into trouble. As does Jessie's. This was something I really loved about this book. Both characters were working with the wrong impression of each other, and sometimes the right impression with the wrong reasoning, and it made their decisions, based more in emotion than sound business sense, that much more troublesome for them. Which in turn made the book that much more fun and enjoyable for me as reader.

If you love a good enemies to lovers, boss/employee, forbidden love romance story, Tamed by the Outlaw by Michelle Sharp is a book I'd recommend reading. It's a fast-paced, well-written romance novella and a great addition to Entangled's What Happens in Vegas continuity series.",4,"[-2.9677894136958267, -1.964950733504443, -1.5666471908782031, -1.0287803189984732, -1.4012782692404795]",-1.0287803189984732
1985,"Elizabeth Vaughan crafts a satisfying conclusion to her Chronicles of the Warlands trilogy, with this installment that brings the Warlord and his Warprize back to the Heart of the Plains.  This is definitely more engaging than the last book, though the original Warprize holds up as the strongest installment.  This is not a standalone new readers need to start at the beginning of the series.

What I like about this book is that it gives Lara a chance to fight for her man. You see, we find out here that there is much Keir has kept to himself about what awaits them in his homeland. He and Lara must be separated, so other warlords have the chance to court her. And if that weren't bad enough, she must stand trial before the Elders to see if she is a worthy Warprize.

Its hard for Lara to be apart from Keir, but this really gives us a chance to see her adapt once again to a foreign environment. We get to see her weave her magic over new strangers and it reminded me why I liked her character so much in the beginning. In fact, its the fantastic character development across the board that really make these books so good. Yes, I cared about Lara and loved my her warlord, Keir.  I also loved Marcus and her relationship with him. I loved the return of Simus. And Iften makes for a great villain.

The worldbuilding continues to expand as we get our first look at the Plains.  We learn even more about the culture and, later, Laras impact on it. We slide a little more into the fantasy realm with a little bit of spirit culture, but it was a touching scene and made me cry a little.

The ending definitely gives a satisfying HEA, though not every single loose end is tied up. There is a fourth book in the series, though it doesnt feature Keir and Lara as the main couple. Ill probably still read it just to get one more taste of this series I have enjoyed so much.

Would recommend this series to fans of fantasy romance.

PS  The sex gets a little steamier with each book. (*wink*)

Set in 1932, this historical cozy set among the socially elite. Amory Ames' marriage is as anything but ideal.  Her husband takes off for months at a time carousing and cavorting with women, not  his wife.  Asked by her old flame, Gill to speak to his sister about life with a rake Amory goes to the resort.  Then the first death occurs and Gill is looked at for the murder.  Putting her own life at risk Amory searches for answers to clear Gill's name.

For the Era the story is well researched and written.  After a bit of a slow start the book takes off and does not look back.  Characters that are true to the social classes they held and Scenes described well to make you feel you are truly back in time.

I had decided that I would shy away from rock star stories  too much drama, cheating, groupies, etc. I gave this one a go because I had read Priscilla West books in the past and enjoyed them. Im so glad I did. This book is not your typical rock star story.

Jax Trenton, lead singer of The Hitchcocks is a complicated man with many demons. Riley Hewitt is a spitfire - seemingly strong and sassy, but she is actually just recovering from a very damaging past relationship. She and Jax first meet at an impromptu concert The Hitchcocks perform at a local club that Riley and her friend Jen were at for a night of fun. There was instant chemistry between Riley and Jax, but not your typical insta-love that you see in so many books. When Riley discovers that her new job assignment is to be the tour accountant for The Hitchcocks, she immediately sees complications on the horizon. She will try to maintain a professional relationship. After all, they just met and nothing happened between themnot really

The thing that set this book apart from the typical rock romance is that the relationship between Jax and Riley built slowly. I liked that. You got to know the characters, and they got to know each other.  The chemistry between Jax and Riley is potent, and unfolds with the perfect amount of tension.

There is so much in this book to love... it is a funny, witty, angst-filled romance with an ending that leaves you wanting more! I cant wait for the next book.

799,"This was a really fun read--reminiscent of the Percy Jackson and Heroes of Olympus books, definitely, though with Norse mythology instead of Greek and Roman--and it has really piqued my interest. It ends on a bit of a cliffhanger, but that's not the only reason I'll be picking up the second book. There's more than a few questions left unanswered at the end (What was up with Laurie's salmon ""dream""? What the heck is up with Odin/Owen's so-called girlfriend? Was she even his girlfriend?) that hopefully will be addressed as the series continues. The action is virtually non-stop, making you want to keep going right to the end.

It's fun to see a different mythology explored in children's lit--if you're not up on the Norse legends, that's not a problem since they do a decent job of explaining without it feeling like a lecture. (Though if you're looking for something to occupy your time before reading book two or while waiting for book three to be released, check out the Norse mythology portions of Don't Know Much About Mythology: Everything You Need to Know About the Greatest Stories in Human History but Never Learned to prepare. It's a fun read, though parts of it are definitely NSFW--and probably NSFK(ids), either. Those gods and goddesses had some interesting...um, appetites.)

Armstrong and Marr have written an interesting set of characters here--Matt (descendant of Thor) and Fen and Laurie (cousins, descended from Loki) get off to a rocky start but quickly form a bond when faced with adversity. As their quest continues, they find--or are found by--other descendants and characters from the legends who draw you in as well. (Valkyries!)

Play Harder starts off exactly where Play Hard ended, with fear of being exposed, hot chemistry between them and the unknown about their future. Jordan and Eric would like nothing more than to be able to be together and play the game they love. But, not only being openly gay players would be exposed, they would be a couple on opposing teams during the wake of a cheating scandal. It can ruin them. Jordan has his family depending on him and Eric loves the game too much to just walk away.

Jordan and Eric have to work together to figure out who is blackmailing them. The play clock is ticking down for them to decide on what to do next. Will the threat of exposure cause Jordan and Eric to part ways or bring them closer than ever? And does it have anything to do with the cheating scandal rocking the game?

I love these two! Jordan is alpha and likes to be in control in the bedroom and really anywhere they can steal some filthy moments together. The chemistry between them is amazingly hot but is their relationship only about sex or is there more?

Overall...it's short, sexy, scandalous and I can't wait for more!

There's a mystery suspense angle to it because of a serial arsonist, the first of its kind, in the town of Old Brookfield and with Gavin being the fire chief, catching the perpetrator before he starts even a worse fire is vital. I had three potential suspects, one lingering closer to the top of that list than the other two, and when the identity was revealed, it was the motive for the crimes that proved to be heartrending.

Gavin and Jordan's love story was anything but simple, what with both of them having to deal with what happened fifteen years ago, and then you add to that their own personal issues and it's obvious that a happily-ever-after will have to be hard fought. I loved the resilience that these two had, refusing to totally give up on the possibility of having the kind of life that mistakes they made robbed them of for so long. Aside from their devotion to each other, love for their families and friends comes into play in this story.

There were a couple of times that I couldn't help but shed a few tears, having been overcome by two events in the story, one that you see coming but playing out beautifully and the other leaving me stunned and equally as heartbroken as the characters in the book. This first book has set the bar extremely high for the rest of the series, but I wouldn't be surprised if my expectations were met and even superseded with each new addition. Brave the Heat is a book I'm highly recommending. Five-plus stars. '",4,"[-3.617746838387194, -1.2907001780093683, -1.4795984343386328, -1.0299176467011748, -1.1995767865717837]",-1.0299176467011748

1382,"Although some say that this novel was predictable, I found it to be entertaining and an easy read. Don't get me wrong, there were some predictable parts, but there were also some extremely creative parts as well.

Briefly, the plot is as follows: twins (Gillian, one twin was undergoing invitro and the other Melina, a successful media escort); Chief, a half indian astronaut (who has demons of his own); Larson, a hardworking detective; Jim, a seemingly harmless fiancee' (to the twin undergoing invitro); a mentally disturbed killer; and Father Gabriel, an evangelist with delusions of gradeur (making as many babies as he can, who will eventually allow him to take over all aspects of industry and ""control"" the world) = a fascinating story.

I am sure you know the plot, the twins switch places (the media escort switches with the twin undergoing invitro) and she and the dashing astronaut have a night to remember. Those exciting times are soon forgotten as the police discover Gillian's body, and words written on the wall pointing to Chief as the reason for her death. You guessed it, the surviving twin, Melina sets out to solve the mystery of her twins' death while trying not to fall for her sister's one time lover. While they search for clues, that eventually leads to a baby making/kidnapping plot, we learn all about Chief (his struggle to accept his mixed heritage) and Melina (who has so many secrets that she sometimes becomes overwhelmed by them).

This book was not your normal hearts and flowers love story,
This was full of Hate, Lust, Passion and deceit.
The only downfall is it ends with a cliffhanger.
The writing was phenomenal and the secondary characters were so strong I hope we see their own  stories in the future.

Shaw and Cassidy have both worked together at Striker Sports Entertainment for the past year and after one of the partners retires they are both in the running for Partner, but to win this position they must compete with one another to gain the contract with Rockford.

Shaw has been groomed by his mentor, the retired partner to take over the position. He is egotistical, cocky and don't like the word no.
Cassidy is sassy, go getem type of girl but around the work place she is known as the Ice Queen

They both have the same idea to seduce their opponent to get their hand on the trophy.and this leads to some hilarious banter between the two of them, some smoking hot sex scenes, and beautiful story of a love/hate relationship. But things are not always what they seem and sometimes you don't realize what is right in front of your face.
The sexual chemistry between these 2 is electrifying

Wow was the first word that came to mind when I finished Bring Her Home.  I haven't finished a book in one sitting in a very long time.  Main character Bill Price tells the story of the disappearance of his daughter and her best friend, Haley.  His desperation made him seem like an unreliable narrator.  The story is fraught with anguish and desperation.  As a parent, I couldn't help but get pulled into the stomach-clenching drama of a missing teenaged girl.  As a mystery lover, I relished each red herring and plot twist.

There are many red herrings and wild goose chases as details of Haley and Summers lives are slowly revealed.  Naturally, their parents are aghast at learning how little they knew of their teens daily lives. While one of my two main suspects ended up being the perpetrator, I thoroughly enjoyed deliberating over each possible suspect and the major reveals as the story reached its zenith.

Ill not destroy a good read by giving away plot details. I will say I thoroughly enjoyed the story, pace and well-developed characters.

656,"Though a number of reasonable explanations have been advanced in recent years, the fate of those lost on the Mary Celeste remains an enduring mystery.

The Mary Celeste was a merchant brigantine found unmanned and adrift in the Atlantic Ocean in the winter of 1872. Missing were the captain, his wife and child and the crew of the vessel. An admiralty inquiry advanced several theories for what happened, including foul play, none of which provided a satisfactory answer.

Valerie Martin has used this mystery to weave an intriguing tale around real life characters involved in the case. Her focus is on the Cobbs and Briggs families, both intricately connected and equally familiar with losses at sea, and with Arthur Conan Doyle, author and advocate of Spiritualism.

Sarah Elizabeth Cobb married Benjamin Briggs, captain of the Mary Celeste, and part of the story is told from her viewpoint. Martin adds a fictional sister, Hannah Cobb, who becomes a medium and her career adds another feature of the novel. Early in his career Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of Sherlock Holmes, penned a controversial fictional tale which is responsible for many false elements of the Mary Celeste legend.

There are other memorable characters, most notably the skeptical journalist Phoebe Grant and Jeremiah Babin, who seeks answers for his own loss through patronage of Violet Petra/Hannah Cobb.

If you're looking for a fictional resolution to the mystery, its not my intent here to dissuade you. I found this journey into a long gone world satisfactory and absorbing.

That being said, I thought the book a marvel in its study of slavery in Africa and how the Asante and Fante used the selling of slaves from other tribes as a way to economic growth. Id never thought about how the British were able to use this tribal warfare which included the capture of slaves to their benefit. I liked Haleys Roots better, but I think that because it was easier for me to trace the family lineage and see the connections between the stories.",3,"[-2.395862053982842, -1.031026088782026, -1.5302040956930343, -1.0595947940444785, -1.1081934093354144]",-1.031026088782026

2568,"The Sex Bucket List by Author Prescott Lane is an over 40, older woman, younger man, romance novel.

I want a man who knows he wants me. Not one who needs to think about it.

Emerson's marriage to the love of her life ended, but she can't seem to move on.  Finding out things about her ex, it spurs her to examine her life. It also doesn't hurt that she runs across a special list made in the company of her friends, Layla and Poppy. Now, what to do with the listthats where a special man comes in.

Thats my role as the man in your life. To guard your heart.

I am a huge fan of Author Prescott Lane's writing. It seems with every book her writing becomes more exceptional than the last.  The Sex Bucket List was absolutely the perfect mix of comedy and drama, giving me all the feels.  Emerson was an absolute over-40 wonder.  Being this age myself, I was happy to see a story that gave a vibrant and independent woman a second chance at finding herself and love.  Her growth in the story was very much what I have seen in life with other people in this age category and helped give it that realistic feel.  The person who became her better half in the story was AMAZING!!  Mateo. Omg!  Holy hotness!  He showed up in this book and nearly caused my Kindle to implode.  Is this man even real?  Fortunately for Emerson, he was. Lucky lady!  Mateo was attentive to her every need, but also carried a measure of authority that made Emerson feel protected and treasured *swoon*.

I have to mention one of my other favorite parts of the story.  There has never been a better female trio than Emerson, Layla, and Poppy. The best of times and the worst of times, these ladies stuck together, challenged one another, and ALWAYS had each other covered...in all things.

""Every woman needs to know her man will fight for her, protect her, go to battle to keep her...""

If you are looking for a story with a hot male lead, strong heroine,  electric chemistry. and priceless love, you NEED this book!

Youll find me a very generous man.""",4,"[-2.4837120339367065, -1.0895735274457885, -1.5364630355127642, -1.0312315772524703, -1.1098836423363276]",-1.0312315772524703

When wealthy Darius Rourke first laid eyes on Marianne she was merely a child. But he was immediately struck by her kind nature. And as he watched her grow and mature over the years. He knew she was the woman he wanted as his wife. Now Marianne doesn't seem to feel the same way. At least not a first. She is basically told either merry Darius or watch as her family's lives are destroyed due to her father's unrelenting debt. But as Darius and Marianne spend more time together and eventually merry. An extremely beautiful and natural love blossoms between them. Now I struggled with a lot of the old wording. I mean I knew for the most part what was being implied.

Edie Harker comes from a long line of vampire hunters, but never expects to have to take on the role as The Harker so soon. When her sister, Meghan, is killed by a vamp, Edie is thrust into the job. Add in the fact that Edie has been infected with a virus that will soon kill her and leave her 3 year old niece, Amelia, as The Harker, and you can see what Edie is out for revenge.

Throw in a vampire with amnesia who calls himself Jude because he hears ""Hey Jude"" on the radio when he first becomes aware of himself, the oldest Vamp ever and a few witches and you have a great book!

The book is full of action, angst, betrayal, pain and sorrow, but there is always a little hope mixed in. The author does an amazing job with character development and moves the story along at a quick pace. If you love Vampire novels, the author also throws in some vampire lore (or not) along the way that keeps things interesting.

With a degree in design, the idea of accepting a job with a branding company seems brilliant, but her salary is small and the area of London where she's found an affordable flat is no where close to the office. Unfortunately, none of that matters when she's faced with her brilliant new boss, Demeter. The title, ""Most Disorganized Human Being,"" doesn't seem to be an over estimation. Demeter seems to always be making statements that she, in utter confusion minutes later, retracts or tries to make sense of. Only her personal assistant seems able to keep her from disaster. She even seems to forget that she's failed to make an employee ""redundant"" or fired, as the English say.  Anyway, while Demeter keeps things interesting at the office, Katie is besieged with problems as simple as difficult bangs to as overwhelming as her computer's sudden death. Her budget doesn't leave room for extras, but for Katie to work on her designs at home, she must buy a functioning computer. Just as you're wondering what else could go wrong, a fabulous man enters her life almost as her job exits it.

After listening to the (excellent performance by Gary Sinise) of the audiobook, I read the written version, which didn't take long. The novella is only about 100 pages in length, conveniently separated into five untitled sections (p xvi) ""so scened and set that it can be played as it stands"" based on an actual incident in the author's experience. Note on this (Penguin Classics) edition - the introduction, though interesting, includes plot spoilers and thus should be saved for last.

Of Mice and Men, set in the mid to late 1930s, is about the relationship between two farm laborers companions, Lennie Small, a hardworking, mentally challenged man, and George Milton, his caregiver of sorts. For a book named after a (Robert Burns) poem entitled To A Mouse, the fact that it begins with the main characters discussing one seems apropos. After arriving near their intended destination, a grain farm, the two spend the evening discussing the past, and contemplating the future; they hope to one day become land owners. Once they arrive at the job site late the next morning, George tries to convince the boss to employ them, after swearing the memory-deficient Lennie to silence. Over the course of the day they meet and learn something about all of the other farm workers and inhabitants. Most of the story takes place on this second (full) day including some foreshadowing of what will come later. The climax of the story takes place on the third day. I wouldn't dare say more as the best way to experience this story is completely unaware of any significant part of the plot. Best of the book: the character development, sights, sounds and climax. Of Mice and Men is a powerful story with intriguing ethical issues.

This book is filled with a lot of mystery and sugar sweet romance. Knoah is a widow who trying to find a way to move on and be happy after the lost of her husband Dylan; then one day she meets Garrick and her entire world changes. The connection between Garrick and Knoah is deep and instant which makes their romance complicated at first and super sweet as it goes.

All the major cities of Europe are where the refugees of the Africa and third world European and Asian third world countries head towards.  Like in America, they drift towards the jobs that no one else wants.

Okwe (Chiwetel Ejiofor) drives cabs during the days and is the night clerk for a tourist hotel at night.  Okwe is a doctor from Lagos.  He is a political fugitive and was framed for the murder of his wife.  He is sharing a flat with one of the maids, Senay (Audrey Tautou).  She is a refugee from Turkey.  Her hope is to eventually immigrate to New York City.

One night the hotel hooker, Juliette (Sophie Okonedo) reports to Okwe an overflowing toilet in the room that she just used.  Okwe goes to the room and dislodges a human heart from the toilet.  He report it to the hotel manager Senior Juan (Sergi Lopez).  But he is not too concerned over it.

Complications begin to occur.  First immigration goes to Senay's apartment and finds evidence that she might be working.  That night they go to the hotel but Okwe is able to warn her.  Now she must find another job.  When Okwe goes to pick up her final pay from the hotel, he runs into a Somolian man and his son in the manager's office.  The son has an infected wound from a kidney removal.  Okwe puts it all together that the manager is in the black market organ business.

With immigration after her, Senay cannot get a job and agrees to sell her kidney for a passport.  Okwe agrees to perform the operation for a passport for himself.  But he has something more in mind.

This is a film of unusual insight and passion.  This is a great film that shows what immigrants must do to have a better life.  What it really shows is that the people who prey on the immigrants are their own.

Both Chiwetel Ejiofor and Audrey Tautou give compelling performances and director Stephen Frears gives up one of his truly personal films that demands to be seen.

1138,"Michael Crummy's quirky ""Galore"", with  sparks of brilliant writing was, unfortunately for me a considerable let down.  Landscapes and human prospects are equally bleak in a town ironically know as Paradise Deep and one more aptly named neighbor,  Gut.  Inhabitants are invariably (and soon) tiresomely quirky.  Characters like Devine's Widow, the matriarchal wiccan contrasted to a drunken and sybaritic RC Father Phelan.  Protestants v. Catholics and children like Mary Tryphena grow to marry not their heart's love but the washed ashore detritus that reeks of dead fish. Good luck...

Indeed Mary Tryphena, Judah and Absalom are the exception, being somewhat fleshed out.  People sort of float in and out without much purpose except to move the years along.  Crummy never stays with anyone very long so Judah may or not be a lucky talisman; Jabez Trim and his wife ache for children and ultimately succeed but we hardly know of their joy.  Indeed, joy and even satisfaction are noticeably absent from the lives any of these Labradorians.  Everyone just sort of drifts from crankiness to misery to shortage to bad weather-- flotsam in nature's harsh and uncompromising universe.

I don't think it necessarily bad that the author depict something so dreary and unpleasant, but I would like to know why anyone in their right mind would want to stay in such a harsh and depressing place. Habit?  Lack of imagination? Masochism?  When Absalom is banished for falling in love with his first cousin I wanted to shout ""run, Abie run, and don't look back.""

1213,"Conn Igguldens WARS OF THE ROSES: STORMBIRD is a novelized account of the beginning of the long, bitter Wars of the Roses, a civil war in England between the Yorks and the Lancastrians.

Historians know that King Henry VI was not very strong as a leader or physically as a person.  His hands were more accustomed to prayer than holding a sword.  His marriage to young Margaret of Anjou was arranged and handled by proxy to attempt a truce with the French, but this is at a cost of lands in France that the English had held.

Readers must note that this is a novel, and Iggulden does note in the back matter that he takes liberties with time simply to keep the plot moving.  Most historical fiction is like this, and we must simply hang on for the ride.

There may well be some historical inaccuracies that Im not aware of; my last studies of British history were about twenty-seven years ago.  However, as historical novels go, I did find this to be interesting reading.  It is violent; readers do see people tortured.  But was that not part of the times?

I truly liked how young Queen Catherine, who was young and had been so pampered, came on so strong in this novel.  Because the king was not strong physically or emotionally, she took charge.

Because it had been so long since Id studied any British history, I found the front matter (maps and family lineage) and back matter (the historical notes and list of characters) essential.  I needed help keeping up with whos who and whats what, and it was there!  Fleshing this matter out even more would be helpful to those of us who are U.S. readers and perhaps have studied no British history at all.

The actual plot of the book has been described fully and well in other reviews so any information you need along those lines is readily available from many other sources.  Although, I must confess that I'm still looking for the diary entries mentioned in the review from Booklist.  Perhaps the chapter headings is what was meant?

I have read many of Rhys Bowen's EVAN EVANS books and always enjoy her handling of a mystery.  I was expecting this book to have the same depth of mystery involvement but I'm afraid I was slightly disappointed along those lines.  This is the first of what will obviously be a new series for this author.  The greater part of the book is given over to the development of Lady Georgiana, her family and friends, and her place in the aristocratic society of the England of 1932.  The writing is first rate.  I enjoyed getting to know the characters and the world they inhabited.  Because actual historical characters are interwoven throughout the story, and because  it is so well written, it is possible to believe that these are real people and I am reading about happenings in their real lives.

My only criticism of the book is that I know how very talented this author is in plotting mysteries.  This one was not quite hard enough to figure out.  In actual fact it was quite easy.  I do want to keep in mind, though, that a lot of information had to be given about Lady Georgiana in order to set her up as our major character and I am assuming that future books will give her a broader scope in which to relate to a wider range of people.  I think that this title was an absolute stroke of genius.  Congratulations on that one, Ms Bowen.  I just loved reading about Georgie going to have tea with Her Majesty.

Apparently, I enjoyed this book more than I thought because when I got to the end, I was surprised.  I was expecting more to the story.  However, when I thought back over the book I realized that all the elements were there.  There was the bunch of alpha males and their supporting female counterparts, the danger, the intrigue, the romance, the hot sex and the HEA.  Seeing how this is the fourth installment of the Severed MC series, it does tie everything up into a neat little bow.  The story is enjoyable and the characters are all likeable (well except for the bad guys).

About the Book:

A dying wish alters the course of a young woman's life.

Life hadn't been easy for Summer Snow. In acts of selflessness-caring for her ailing parents and running her grandmother's bookstore-she had forfeited her youth and dreams for the needs of others. And the only tries she had at love... didn't turn out. She had the bookstore, she had her beloved granny, but she was missing something-or someone.

Opportunity strikes when Granny sends Summer on an unexpected adventure with one Martin Langtree, a kind but gangly young man from Summer's past. A childhood friendship is rekindled, a romance is sparked, and mysteries are solved in one magical Texas summer. Will Summer strike out on love again, or will things finally go her way?

With lovable characters and surprising twists, Summer's List is a simple delight.

My Review

After her parents were injured in a car wreck, Summer Snow devoted her life to taking care of them. Now she learns that her grandmother isn't as well as she seems to be. But with only six months to live, Summer's grandma still has a few things up her sleeves.

Armed with a list from her grandmother, Summer sets out on an adventure. First to find out what ever happened to her childhood friend, Martin Langtree. Arriving at his last known address, she learns that Martin is quiet genius, secluded in the back yard guest house. Seeing after all these years, she learns that something's never change. With Martins cute Chihuahua by their side, its sure to be an amazing adventure.

Summers List is an amazing story about beautiful friendship, romance in the works, and a just plain fun adventure. Anita Higman has written many books and this book doesnt lack in the least. I enjoyed the characters attitudes and personalities. I look forward to reading many more of her wonderful books.

While this was quite a long book (20 hours and 39 minutes of listening time), I found it very enjoyable with a great plot that I thought at times I had figured out but was incorrect. It was one that kept me in the dark until the last few chapters towards the end of the book where things are revealed. The story switches back and forth from the early 1900's to 1975 and then 2005, which is something I actually enjoy in a book if it is well done. This one definitely was.

Small towns  our world in microcosm, and we are a mean and gossipy, species, thriving on the preconceived notions of our youth as we struggle to outgrow them as we gain the wisdom of age. But often the gossip is the best of it. The abuse that human beings pile on one another and on their children behind closed doors is worse, far worse, leaving scars that don't heal easily, if at all. And children in the same family within the same walls experience horror differently. The reader is called upon to piece together that Lucy Bartons home was really like. Her sister and her brother remember the same time, the same flawed parents, but differently. And, it isn't just the family, but the world around them. It does indeed take a village to raise children, and insights into the village as well as the home are most enlightening. This is the world one sees in the writing of Elizabeth Strout, and as her characters struggle, learn and sometimes grow. It isn't light and it isn't easy to read, but the narrative carries you through the nice moments and the horrors of memories unearthed and exposed. Her writing is excellent, and her story-telling painfully honest. We can all learn so much from her characters and her writing.

2692,"I thought this book was quite interesting for a couple reasons.  The first is that I grew up on a farm myself (and my cousins are still farming there) so I thought I would enjoy reading about farm life in another country.  The second is that the Lake District of England is a place I would like to visit for the hiking and scenery.

In the end, this book was different enough from my expectations that those initial reasons ended up not being very relevant to the book.  But the book kept my interest event though it was not what I expect.

I grew up on a Minnesota dairy farm, which couldn't be more different from a fells sheep farm.  My father kept his cows fenced in and close to home on his own land but the author's sheep spend the summer up on common land along with the sheep of other shepherds.  Although Rebanks uses modern conveniences like a 4-wheeler to go to where his sheep are, many of the farming techniques are rooted in history.

The author gives definitions to some of the terms that are specific to British sheep farming, but even so a number of the words were unfamiliar to me.  American readers may want to have a tablet nearby to look up the British expressions.

This book covers a lot of ground from stories of the author's childhood to descriptions of more recent events.  The narrative is not linear -- the book is organized by season not by timeline -- so it was occasionally frustrating to catch part of his life and then the continuation later in the book.

So many people live in urban and suburban areas and have no ties to the country and the farming life that I think books like this are important to give an understanding of where the food we eat comes from and the amount of work it takes.",3,"[-2.612877057665198, -1.6938342325660802, -1.032939710027906, -1.0665746456232652, -1.513327440070574]",-1.032939710027906

Second, they can apparantly do things like walk around on 2 feet and carry plates, drive cars, open windows, etc. And yet, they also get mistaken for stray dogs, so I'm guessing they also walk around on all fours. I had a bit of a hard time getting a good visual picture of them in my head, but the picture I did get reminded me somewhat of that 1985 Michael J. Fox movie ""Teen Wolf"". If you've seen it, you'll know what I mean. And that is kind of the overall feel I got from the book. It's cute and a little corny, but not in a bad way. The werewolves are almost like a sub-culture that is part of (and yet not part of) society. Even as wolves they continue to act like humans, only covered in fur (and sometimes still wearing clothes). Rylie is a fun character although I'm not so sure how I feel about Jennifer or Jack. Without revealing any details, the way they treated Rylie at one point in the book frustrated me (more so than it did Rylie, apparantly).

At the end of book1 Katya makes a heartbreaking discovery that sends her into a tailspin of more unpredictable and sometimes impulsive decisions.
At the heart of this story is  a very young, inexperienced, woman struggling with the consequences of her behavior.
Does she continue her alter ego persona or return to her goody 2 shoes character!
The 2 men in the center of her dilemma had their own issues, and frankly I'm surprised by the outcome of this story. I felt one character got a a more positive characterization over the other one and he was just as bad.
Can trust be regained after a terrible betrayal?
Who was really playing games?
Why can't she have it all?
Why are the roles so different for men than they are for women?
As she tries to self develop, grow up, and mature we learn how critical she is of herself and I never really learned why.

The story starts off promisingly enough with Cromwell reeling in his former protege with the promise of more time for a client's defense.  The addition of Cromwell's cohort Jack Barak is a welcome one, offering ""assistance"" to Shardlake as he wends his way through London's seedy underbelly.

In fact, the addition of Barak is the best part of the story--a fine counterpoint to the more proper Shardlake.  Unfortunately, that's all the good news.  The story about Dark Fire is a bit contrived and the plot of undermining Cromwell by duping him seems rather farfetched.  The guy didn't get from nowhere to the pinnacle of Tudor power by being anyone's patsy. The parallel mystery of the Wentworth family is okay, but hardly difficult to figure out.

281,"Set in the mid nineteenth century during the California gold-rush, Walk on Earth a Stranger is a captivating and often touching read. After her parents' brutal murder, Leah Westfall is forced to leave her hometown of Dahlonega, Georgia, to escape her uncle, Hiram. Hoping to meet up with her longtime friend, Jefferson McCauly, she heads west with thousands of gold seekers and pioneers with only her horse, Peony, for company.

A true page-turner, Walk on Earth a Stranger is definitely among my favorite five books for this year. This book gripped me from the very first page where it is revealed that the main character, Lee, has an unusual supernatural gift. From there on I simply immersed myself in the adventures of Leah, her horse, and her best friend, Jefferson.

The characters in this book are realistic, endearing and definitely the kind of people one wants to continue reading about. Leah is tough and gutsy, yet, deep down she is still the lady her mother wanted her to be.

Jefferson is a bit more of an enigma. With his Native American heritage, he is often bitter about other people's attitudes regarding his ethnicity. He and Leah make a wonderful team when they are working for the Joiner family. Together, and knowing each other's ways, they perform several rescues during the hard journey to California.

What struck me was the staggering amount of research the author must have put into this book. Vivid descriptions of life in a travelling wagon train put me right there with the families as they journeyed across prairie, desert and mountains. Romance is only hinted at throughout most of this story.

For a stimulating, gripping and deeply touching read, I recommend Walk on Earth a Stranger as an absolute must-read. (Ellen Fritz)",4,"[-3.270363412398403, -2.232076361869918, -1.5752507611423276, -1.0339829494001467, -1.349171260220484]",-1.0339829494001467
966,"Aurora Teagarden is basking in the news of her pregnancy when disaster strikes her small Georgia town: four kids vanish from the school soccer field in an afternoon. Auroras 15-year-old brother Phillip is one of them. Also gone are two of his friends, and an 11-year-old girl who was just hoping to get a ride home from soccer practice. And then theres an even worse discoveryat the kids last known destination, a dead body.

While the local police and sheriffs department comb the county for the missing kids and interview everyone even remotely involved, Aurora and her new husband, true crime writer Robin Crusoe, begin their own investigation. Could the death and kidnappings have anything to do with a group of bullies at the middle school? Is Phillips disappearance related to Auroras fathers gambling debts? Or is Phillip himself, new to town and an unknown quantity, responsible for taking the other children? But regardless of the reason, as the days go by, the most important questions remain. Are the kids still alive? Who could be concealing them? Where could they be?

With Christmas approaching, Aurora is determined to find her brotherif hes still alive.

Review:

I was so happy to see another book in this series.  It had been sooo long I did not have hope of another one.  Some of the last books in the series had started to loose their luster, but this one brought it back.  The book is filled with quirky characters, red herrings and a good plot.  It is what I remember of the series, a great little mystery to spend an afternoon reading.

In this book Aurora has just gotten married, she is pregnant and her brother has come to live with them.  Then Phillip goes missing with a few other kids and Roe must find them, hopefully alive.

I was very happy with this addition to the series and I hope we don't have to wait another 10 years for another one.

2097,"Not typically a reader of romance novels, particularly if there isn't some sort of mystery or suspense story to go along with it, I'm not sure why I chose to read ""Under a Summer Sky"" by Melody Carlson, other than the fact that I like Carlson's work and it takes place in Savannah, one of my favorite cities. It didn't take long to dive into Carlson's summer romance story. Nicole Anderson is a high school art teacher looking forward to a relaxing summer in Savannah, house-sitting and managing an art gallery for a family friend.

Instead of the relaxing summer she imagined, she finds she must deal with a difficult employee, a runaway teenager and two brothers vying for her affection. But, in Savannah, between the historical and incredible architecture and ghost stories, anything, even romance, can happen.

Love, love, love. I love reading stories about places I've been. Carlson's descriptions were wonderful and her story was appealing. Nicole's personality and charm was just enough to make me want to meet her in real life. She was compassionate and wise and she had a way of bringing people together in spite of themselves. I absolutely loved this story and wish it never had to end. It made me yearn to visit Savannah again.

1553,"In alternating chapters told from the viewpoints of Joe, the class misfit, and Ravi, the new kid in school, Save Me a Seat taps into the feelings of not fitting in and trying to find one's place in the world.  Despite the villain of the piece reading like a stereotypical class bully, Weeks and Varadarajan manage to make both Joe and Ravi likable while also giving them some depth.  The feelings are real enough despite a  straight-forward story that unfolds over the course of five school days.  Parents will appreciate the lessons learned while kids will connect to the fact that both main characters are underestimated in their abilities.  Not the most original book in the end, but it is well written without being overly long and beating you over the head with the message.  A solid middle grade book about what it means to have a friend and the (un)importance of being the most popular kid in class.

There were several laugh out loud funny moments.  The plot was rather original and interesting.  There wasn't a lot of character development but there was enough for me to like and root for Grace.  I'm sure more will be revealed regarding Rose, as well as, her past as the Series progresses.  We weren't told Grace's age but I got a sense that she was over 40.  The mystery itself was rather simple but there were several suspects so I was kept guessing until the bit reveal.  I was a little surprised by who it turned out to be and that's always a good thing when reading a mystery.  The author's writing style was concise and straight forward.  There wasn't any excessive dialogue or descriptions which frankly works for me in most instances b/c I bore easily.  I'm looking forward to the next novella in this delightful new Series.

I was so glad I did.  Not only did I fall in love with the characters, but reading about this time period and that Academy then was wonderful!  One of the things that drew my heart to West Point was during a visit there, I realized that so many historical figures actually walked and lived in the same halls and rooms I was in.  You could almost feel their presence in a weird way.  So reading this book was  a little like that.

The story takes place in 1855 and it centers around a cadet at the academy and a young woman who comes to live with her family.

I do not want to give anything away, but I will tell you I thoroughly enjoyed the story, the setting and most of all the characters!  This is the first novel I have read by Siri Mitchell and would happily ready another book by her in the future.  The time and detail that Ms. Mitchell pours into her story is realized on the first few pages.

936,"This novel is the closing book in the quartet that Mr. Shaara wrote about the largely ignored (at least in historical fiction) western theater of the American Civil War. I believe that the series is worth your time to read if you have a preexisting interest in the subject.
The Fateful Lightning is really General Shermans book. It begins with his leaving Atlanta after its capture and concludes with the surrender of Joe Johnstons army in late April of 1865. Per his usual style, the book is written in alternating viewpoints from a few character's point of view. Each chapter is a first person account from its narrator. Other than William T. Sherman, no other character really registers consistently in the novel. I think that General Sherman is one of the better characters (in terms of how he is written) that Mr. Shaara has created so I did not mind this.
A quibble with the text, Mr. Shaara clearly cannot write woman characters. When they show up and speak it is not very authentic or interesting. Oddly enough, the second book in this series did have a compelling female character as one of its alternating narrators. Not sure what happened here?
There are also a few moments where slavery appears to be whitewashed, but stick with it. The evil of slavery is not whitewashed at all; Mr. Shaara is just presenting it in its historical context without judging. I appreciated that approach. It speaks for itself, and the author does not (and did not) have to condemn it in modern terms. As the novel progresses, it clearly condemns itself.
The book bears out the enormity of the Civil War with an unexpected subtlety in its final chapters that is quite good. It is appropriate and well done.

Jack and Walter slip back into their most famous alter egos, Oscar and Felix, thirty years later.  Oscar has been exiled to Sarasota, Florida.  Felix is still in New York.  They are reunited when Oscar's son and Felix's daughter decide to get married in California.

They meet up at the airport and start a 200 mile road trip to the wedding.  The sight gags are silly but for some reason Lemmon and Matthau actually make them funny.  The best scene are the simple one on one scenes with Jack and Walter.

Christine Baranski (""Cybil"") and Jean Smart (""Designing Women"") make a hilarious appearance as Thelma and Louise wanna be's.

If you love Jack and Walter or Neil Simon, this is a must have DVD.  If not, then pass.

2880,"I had the most fun with this one. This was the way to start a new series. Willful, strong, independent, capable, sassy, witty, and a princess. Gun toting, knife wielding, bandit hunting, feisty little sister Gillian was a bit more than the Duke of Leverton was expecting. Gillian grandmother needed help with getting her granddaughter caught up to what she should have already known.

Immediate dislike between the two was clear. A perfect match for each other was even clearer. The instata love and hop right in to bed was not this one. Thank you. Gillian carries this story all the way to the end. Not to discount Charles presences. She was everything a heroine should aspire to be. She was a peoples princess. She could ride with the best of them. She could shoot, fight, hunt. She was all that a free woman of strength, courage, beauty, lineage could be.

Charles found all her quality appealing to him but not suitable for the ton. She need work and polish. She was going to make none of it easy. She was who she was because of what she was. Confusing but true. If she would have been raise in the home of her father she would not have been the heroine that I love. She gave it all and then some. She didn't back down. She stood her ground. Charles has rarely found any one that could change his take on the world. Gillian made that change in small increments but she proved that she was more than just a female in breeches.

V. Kelly brought me a heroine that will be held on to and revisited just for who she was and the strength of character she displayed.

1932,"The second novel in Beverly Lewis' Seasons of Grace series, it picks up almost immediately where The Secret leaves off. I enjoyed this one a lot more than I did the first one.

Grace Byler's mother has been missing for several weeks and as the family tries to continue with their lives, they wonder at her reasons for leaving and hope for her return. As Grace begins to piece together the few clues she has about why her mother left, she simply finds more questions. When the young man she thought liked her best friend Becky, suddenly transfers his interest to her, she's reluctant to accept his advances. Taking care of her family and wishing to search for her mother are her most important priorities.

Her friendship with Heather, the young Englisher deepens and the two young women are able to help each other.  Heather finally tells her father about her illness and he, understandably, wants her to take the traditional course of treatment, not an alternative one.

As Lettie searches for her own answers, away from her family, her husband Judah searches for his own at home.  He suspects that his in-laws have the answers, but they aren't forthcoming.

This is a compelling story. The characters are well-developed and easy to care about. It is also, obviously, a link in the trilogy. Nothing is really resolved and more questions arise than are answered. Little clues are planted that hint at the discoveries to come. I think I have things figured out, but await the next book for confirmation!

There were so many twists and turns it was hard to figure how who were the good guys and who were the bad. Enemies became frenemies as the situation that Riley and Naven were in became more complicated and changed frequently. The difference between the Queens and their worlds reminded me of the Light and Dark Fae with contrasting homes, architecture and way of life yet both Queens were ruthless and bloodthirsty and would stop at nothing to win the kingdom. Interesting how in the south one human turned heads yet in the north no one questioned a whole group of them appearing out of nowhere. It is kind of like the game of Chess - so many pawns in play all capable of taking out the Queen if given the right opportunity but will Riley and her friends be able to make the right move in time to save Earth and the people they care about.

I grew up watching Carson and I would try to stay awake and sneak downstairs to watch the show while everyone was sleeping.  Carson was one of the more intelligent men ever to have a show, but it is interesting to me that those who held the Tonight Show job including Carson, Steve Allen and Jack Parr were not only entertaining but also highly intelligent.  That is certainly not the case with the current host of the show, but thats another story.

This biography is one that Carson would not have liked because of it leaving him bare with his faults.  But it was certainly an honest one.  Im a bit troubled about an attorney revealing so much about a client even one who eventually fired him and then sued him for malpractice.  Bushkin early in the book makes a statement that he assured Carson that he would not reveal his confidence so long as you are alive.  Honestly, did he really say so long as you are alive?  If he did, then I wonder if Carson would have said, and BEYOND, understand!

Regardless, this book did not come across like a hit job despite the acrimony that was in the end of their 18-year relationship.  It was honest sounding and very entertaining.  I could tell early on that I would never have been able to work for Carson in any capacity.  Well, at least not for long since I don't do well with dictator types.  But none of that has anything to do with my good memories of watching him on the show.  He fascinated me with his interviews and he made me laugh.

Yes I know they are fictional, but Amelia and Lincoln are characters I have read for years and I love the small events in the lives of these characters as much as I do Deaver's signature twists and turns.

The book starts out with one of the most impressive crimes scenes I have ever read, and Deaver leads you in as such. That little lead in sets the stage for a great short, that had me flying through pages. I won't give anything else away because I don't want to ruin any aspect of this story, so just read it.

As to Deaver's skill in misdirection and plot twists they are clearly evident in this story. Again, I tried to think like Deaver and tried effortlessly to figure out who the killer was, and again I was wrong. Deaver even had a little bit at the end saying this character was a suspect and ruled out, it was almost like Deaver knew I was going to try to out think him and he anticipated my deductions.

671,"Back in December, I read Daniel Wilson's Robopocalypse, an enjoyable sci-fi disaster novel.  I was particularly excited when I read about his new novel, Amped.  The set-up intrigued me: in the very near future, many people with physical and neurological disabilities are ""amped.""  They have artificial implants which give them full functionality, and, in some cases, super-human abilities.  However, a social-political movement has arisen, giving the ""amps"" second-class status, stripping them of basic rights.

What I thought would be an interesting treatise on disability rights turned out to be a standard story in sci-fi, the ""supers"" versus ""normals"" story played out in X-Men, Heroes, and elsewhere.  Faced with segregation and persecution, a group of amps begins a revolution.  The hero, Owen Gray, whose father developed some of the amp technology, gets caught up in the rebellion.  As the rebellion spreads, Wilson never adequately conveys the scope or implications of the movement.  I wasn't convinced that the events of the book really had a broader impact on the nation.  By contrast, in Robopocalypse Wilson skillfully placed the characters' stories within the context of the world-wide events.

Amped wasn't a bad book.  I was disappointed that Wilson did not develop the problems related to amping.  The persecution on amps did not seem logical, especially since most amps were truly disabled people whose lives are improved by technology.  I know we see rare cases in which people with prosthetics may face societal resistance, such as Oscar Pistorius's struggle to be included in the Olympics.  But I don't see that expanding to full fledged persecution; even though some did not think he should have been allowed to race because of his mechanical advantage, no one was clamoring for his citizenship to be taken away or his human rights to be denied.",2,"[-1.6783352995995418, -1.3695045577007603, -1.1631965397301156, -1.0367238885931505, -1.3266180383449933]",-1.0367238885931505

There is a attraction right from the start and Kieran knows that Lily is his and he can't wait to finally make her his.

433,"In his terrific speculative thriller, Fatherland, Robert Harris plopped us down in  the middle of an alternate reality where Nazi Germany had won a stalemate with the United States and  Hitler was about to celebrate his 75th birthday in 1964.  The book was plausible and very exciting,  but best of all it confronted readers with the similarity between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union  and implicitly asked why the west fought one and aided the other.  Now, in Enigma, he shows that he  can work equally effectively against the backdrop of actual events and still broach big ideas.
It's February, 1943 and Tom Jericho, a brilliant young Cambridge mathematician and protg of Alan  Turing, has already suffered one nervous breakdown under the pressure of working to break secret  Nazi codes.  Now he's summoned back to Bletchley Park because the U-boat code, known as Shark,  which was previously decrypted due to an epiphany of his, has suddenly been changed just as an  enormous supply convoy from America is setting out for Britain.  Despite his delicate mental state, it's  felt that he'll be valuable just for his totemic value and to reassure the higher-ups that all the best men  are working on the problem.
Complicating matters is the disappearance of Jericho's ex-girlfriend, Claire Romilly, who it appears  may have tipped off the Germans that their codes had been cracked.  At any rate, some must have  betrayed this vital secret, and, even as the supply convoy sails towards one of the biggest U-boat  wolfpacks ever assembled, Jericho sets out to discover who the traitor is and where Claire has  disappeared too.
The author too manages a difficult feat as he balances the mystery plot with healthy dollops of WWII  history and cryptographic technique.  Jericho's quest for Claire is exciting enough, but it's the details  about the Enigma machines, which produced what the Nazis believed to be an unbreakable codes, and  the British success in breaking them anyway, which really make for fascinating reading.  Then, as if  that weren't enough, when Harris introduces the reason that someone at Bletchley would assist the  Nazis, he returns to some of the troubling moral and geopolitical questions that he first raised in  Fatherland.  It all makes for a thoughtful thriller that entertains, enlightens and provokes the reader.

74,"Annihilation by Jeff VanderMeer has been on my radar for several years now. The acclaim and notoriety that is received immediately following publication inspired me to instantly add it to my TBR list. Then, as often happens with books on that list, I ignored it for several years. The announcement and intriguing trailer of a film adaptation of the book brought it to the forefront of my list again.

The novel immediately presents itself as an eerie mix of sci-fi thriller and character drama. A group of women explorers have set out on an expedition to Area X, a mysterious portion of land that has been enveloped by a transparent border. Everything within the confines of Area X disappeared, and the remaining ecosystem has been vastly changed ever since. The explorers, made up of a Biologist, Linguist, Psychologist, Surveyor, and Archeologist, set out on a mission that is shrouded in secrecy. They are not even allowed to reveal their names to each other.

We learn of this strange place through journal entries written by the Biologist. As the unit advances deeper and deeper into Area X, the unusual nature of the place is slowly revealed to us. There is a blaring sound that trumpets through the bizarre landscape each night. Much of the novel focuses on a tunnel that the squad comes into contact with, though oddly the Biologist is convinced it is more of a tower than tunnel. The walls are covered in a writing that seems to be alive. More mysterious, it seems as if someone or something is still in the process of writing it.

Despite the allure of the high-concept sci-fi that the novel provides, the slow pace, distant characters, and no real ending really kept me from enjoying Annihilation. The book is only a couple hundred pages long, but I could never find a comfortable rhythm while reading it. We purposefully don't know the characters names, and their backstories and motivations are revealed through small anecdotes provided by the Biologist. I found that this unknown made it difficult to grasp onto any of the characters. The hints of a really great story made what I read all the more frustrating. The novel is the first part of a trilogy, but I'm not sure there are enough redeeming qualities to continue reading. Oddly, I'm still excited about the movie. This may be a rare case where I'm okay with the filmmakers drastically modifying the story from the book.",1,"[-3.3589809998532085, -1.323888434494217, -1.671229599946885, -1.037585099395535, -1.1646074985709474]",-1.037585099395535

This is the second book in the Gardiner and Renner series (let me note that I haven't read the first one) and the main characters are Maggie and Renner, she a forensics expert, he a homicide detective. Both are searching for a killer, so the plot wasn't bad. What I had trouble with is the two leads. I was hoping for some sparks, and couldn't find any.

In the end I have to say the book was good, but I just wished it concentrated more on character development, rather than the plot and unlimited data of  the newspaper industry.

866,"While the first Dragonriders of Pern book (Dragonflight) was fun, it was also somewhat predictable. I had the solution to the problem long before it was introduced by Anne McCaffrey. In Dragonquest, there was no such deus ex machina plot device to figure out. The book is largely a complex character study, during which we are introduced to myriad Lords of Holds, Dragonflight Leaders, Masters of Craft Guilds, and several other interesting characters. McCaffrey really put herself to the test in creating unique characters both in cooperation and conflict. She also introduced new fauna, with her Fire Lizards a surprising element both for their ""cool factor"" and for the ultimate impact on the story.

She wasn't afraid to put some of her characters into difficult and tragic situations. In a lesser author's hands this might put off some readers. McCaffrey brought it off with great skill. She even left a very interesting story arc in play for the next book, without leaving a cliff hanger to make readers want to continue the series. Her heroes aren't perfect, in fact at times they are very flawed. I think that is one reason they come to life so vividly and become so well known to the reader.

Although I had somehow avoided reading this series for some decades now, I finally decided a few weeks ago that I should give it a try. That turned out to be a very good decision.

Review: Hard Edit, the sequel to Black Balled, by Andrea Smith and Eva LeNoir, is absolutely fantastic! Like the first book, I listened to the audio book narrated by Joel Leslie. The characters, including Muffy and Minette, are well developed, amusing and fabulous. Joel Leslie brought them to life, gives the story the extra cherry on top to an already fabulous story.

Troy and Larson have been dating for a year now and are still living in their apartments within the same building. Troy has been secretly finishing a novel that is loosely based on his rough childhood. As a result, Troys childhood friend, who is mentioned in the book, seeks him out. This causes so much drama! Who knew that the childhood friend, Ethan, later went on to date Larson years later! Can Larson and Troy get over the jealousy that they have for the other? Can their relationship survive it?

This series is a #OneClick for all those who love a naughty MM romance!

I am of the generation that watched and loved the Spenser series on TV and tend to resist the written material once a movie or TV series is out. Fortunately that friend persisted and I decided to start reading.

I am a person who, when beginning a series, always starts with book one, no matter how old it is or when it came out. This book did not disappoint. Though it is a bit dated, having been published in the 70s, it still carries the air of authenticity of character that transcends the passage of time. Spenser is a wisecracking, smart PI on the hunt for a stolen manuscript and on a mission to prove the innocence of a framed girl. The story is full of twists and turns that kept me guessing. He is the imperfect hero that readers long for. I nearly finished it on my bus commute home - so transfixed that I nearly missed my stop.

6738,"Gah! I loved these two together. As in, they're officially one of my all-time favorite couples in the world of M/M romance and that's saying something because that list is exclusive for those men who I was fully invested in and still obsess over. Ezra and Dae may be opposites in more ways than one but it's those differences that make them so darn perfect for each other. It's like one fills the gaps within the other, and in the end, they make one another whole, though it's clear that Ezra has more issues than Dae does based on Ezra's past relationship and his upbringing alone. But Ezra is also the one who makes Dae see that he is open to commitment...with the right man.

Now, there was some apprehension on my end when the whole Catholic angle was brought in. I'm a lifelong Catholic--albeit a liberal one--and while I can readily admit that the Church has an antiquated way of thinking on many touchy subjects, it's also been more progressive as of late, thanks to Pope Francis. So, I was wary about it being made into a scapegoat of sorts, but lo and behold, it wasn't. I should have had more faith in the authors because they took it in a pleasantly surprising direction. As an aside, the term ""pastor"" threw me off since it's one I've never heard used in Catholicism but Google informed me that it is used in the US for parish priests. Go figure.

Three books into this series and I still can't tell who between Christina Lee and Nyrae Dawn are writing which parts, and that's a testament to how seamlessly these two seem to work as a duo. Just like the two before it, their third endeavor tugs at your heartstrings when it comes to the personal back stories of the main characters while giving you romance and sex that are super swoon-worthy. But I must say, this is probably them at their best together. The prose was enthralling and the story with a balanced mix of dramatic angst and lighthearted witticisms.

When I went to visit my mother-in-law in Florida, I discovered that she had purchased a medical alert bracelet that required an Internet connection. The main unit for the medical device, required that the single Ethernet cable she had, be plugged into the back of the unit. Since I wanted to use my laptop computer, and there was no wireless connection available, I wasn't sure what to do. My brother-in-law, who lives in the same condo complex, let me use his computer to search for something on Amazon that would solve the problem. After searching for a while; I came across this Ethernet switch made by Lynksys and made the purchase.

Setting it up couldn't have been easier. First I plugged the Ethernet switch into a wall outlet. Than, I removed the main Ethernet cable from the medical device and plugged it into port number one on the switch. Next, I plugged the medical device into port number two. Finally, I plugged my laptop into port number three. The only extra items that I had to purchase were two 6' Ethernet cables which I used for the medical device and my laptop computer. The entire set-up took less than 5 minutes and the results were exactly what I had hoped for. I'm able to use my laptop computer at the same time that my mother-in-law's medical device is in use.

She reconnects with her family and with a couple of glamorous girlfriends, and these people -- plus a couple of handsome guys and a few fellow townspeople I hope we'll see developed more in the future of the series -- are the center of the story.

The people, that is, and the place: a museum of the paranormal that Maddie finds herself at first grudgingly caring for to help a friend, but which becomes an important part of her life in the course of the book. Is it haunted? Is it possible to make it pay? Can Maddie overcome the powerful women's group lobbying against it -- and the fact that there was a murder committed there?

In a way, this book feels like a pilot for the series, laying down the basic story to get ready for more mysteries to come. We get why Maddie and her wealthy fashionista friends are in a small town near Sacramento, we see how artifacts in the museum can provide mysteries for Maddie to solve (in this book, the mystery from the past is more intriguing than the one in the present), we understand the personal issues that will give Maddie plenty to think about and worry over for books to come, and we are introduced to the Paranormal Museum which will doubtless flourish in the future.

3708,"The Ones Who Got Away is the first book in a series by the same name about several survivors of a school shooting (at the prom, nonetheless! OMG, the descriptions/nightmares here were vivid--just a heads-up), twelve years later. This one deals with two of the survivors, Liv and Finn; the only other survivors we meet are all women (Rebecca, Kincaid, and Taryn) so presumably their SOs will not be fellow survivors...? Though I could be wrong--time will tell.

Anyway...

The four women, who hadn't been particularly close before the shooting, came together afterwards and at one point before graduating and going their separate ways, wrote letters to be opened in ten years in which they each pledged--to themselves and to honor their classmates who didn't ""get away""--to do certain things with their lives. They all missed the decade mark, but when they are brought back to town for a documentary about their experience, the woman who had custody of the letters brings them with her. Over drinks, the four of them read their letters out loud and decide what they have or haven't accomplished (with not a little bit of justification and hedging on some of their parts--and a teensy bit of cringing, too ;))

Liv's pretty sure she doesn't actually need to go through with her younger self's plans--and absolutely sure that she doesn't need to pick things up with Finn where they left off (she was from the wrong side of the tracks, and his father was very controlling and not terribly nice, to put it mildly, so theirs was a secret relationship) but of course fate--and Ms. Loren--have other ideas. I loved watching Liv and Finn as they reconnected, came to terms with their pasts, and figured out a way that they could move together into a future--second chance romance at its best :)

I'm not sure how this managed to be my first book from Ms. Loren, but it absolutely won't be my last! Rebecca's story is next--can't wait!

3111,"As far as debut novels go, this one is quite good. I love chick lit, and therefore I expected a light, fluffy read, and thats exactly what I got. I wasn't too fond of the main character, Ginny, (silly name) and found her to be waaaaaayyyyyy to weepy and overly dramatic. It was very hard warming up to her. But, in stark contrast, I loved Jen and Annies characters. It was easy to connect with Jen because I could relate to her practical and efficient get-things-done nature. Annie was lively and loads of fun with a fantastic sense of humor. These two girls are what kept me reading till the end.

I enjoyed that this was a light and easy read, but at the same time it was also rather predictable. I could easily spot all the major plot twists a mile away because of the plot devices the author used earlier on in the book. No matter though, it was still a very enjoyable read. Josh and Luke...I don't know. Luke was clearly used as filler for the story and I didn't care for him at all. I was actually happy when he left. Josh was just as bland. I couldn't understand why Ginny would cry for more than a year about him. Nah...I really didn't care about Josh either. In fact, I think this story can easily stand on its own without these two male characters. Romance junkies would definitely get a kick out of the cheesy romance, but Ginnys constant moping about Josh got old really fast.

Im giving Three Girls and a Baby a four-star rating because despite my grumbling about some of the issues I had with it, it was an enjoyable read with a positive and inspiring feel to it. It sends out a clear message about responsibilities, taking control of your life, and owning up to past mistakes and moving on. Another round of editing would sort out the tiny grammar issues. I recommend this to fans of womens fiction and to anyone looking for a feel-good, quick read. Just a warning to those sensitive to profanity, there is quite a lot of cussing in this book.",3,"[-3.8066505757330305, -1.0851100697352973, -1.2477994205116438, -1.0400427934635492, -1.642986124047272]",-1.0400427934635492

I'm sure I must have missed some character nuances by starting with this book, but I didn't feel there was anything I needed to know that wasn't in this book.

This book grabbed me from the first page (though it took me a bit to figure out it didn't start in Minnesota) and I couldn't put it down.  I read it during one of the last winter storms here in Minnesota so I had the perfect sound effects for the book's setting.

The main plot was gripping enough, but just when I thought it was over, he threw in a completely unexpected twist that caught me by surprise.  As I wrote in my review title:  Wow.  Just.  Wow.

9394,"`The Last Mimzy"" released in '07 is a good family film with some extremely clever storyline twists and turns combining aspects of Tibetan spirituality and time-travel with the ""Alice in Wonderland"" fable. Unfortunately the originality of the storyline is overshadowed by overt similarities with the all-time family favorite `E.T.'.

Yes, the book upon which this movie is based predates the Spielberg classic but `E.T.' hit the big screen first and thus takes presidence in the hearts and minds of the viewing public. To make matters worse the production choose a young boy who looks like `E.T.' star Henry Thomas as one of the films co-stars further establishing the pronounced similarities between the two feature films. I think that was a big mistake, not that Chris O'Neil didn't give a fine performance as Noah Wilder, I just think the director should have known better and found someone with a completely different look. On a more positive note, little Rhiannon Wryn is marvelous as Emma Wilder. Without her presence the film would lose its strongest asset.

Little kids will love it even though they will probably miss some of the more complicated twists in the plot. For most adults one viewing is definitely enough.

2094,"""A Promise to Protect"" by Patricia Bradley is the 2nd book in the Logan Point series.  This was a murder mystery novel with the hero of the story a Sheriff Ben Logan protecting a woman he knows from his past named Leigh Somerall. It starts with the murder of Leah's brother and Sheriff Ben who found her brother who told him before he died to protect his sister.  That's all I will write without giving away much more. First off before I give my opinion I want to say I don't think I have ever read any other books by this author so I am not familiar with her style.  Well here goes I just did not like this book. It did not flow easily where I thought it should have it jumped and skipped to much for me.  I would start getting into the book then things bounced around too much for me and I just could not get into the book. I also prefer more mystery than romance and this book was so intertwined with the past romance of the main characters to the current story with them.

693,"I literally burned through His Dark Materials in two days. The world-building is exceptional and the story was fast-paced and engaging. This final book is not as good as the first book, but provides a (mostly) satisfying conclusion to a well-told tale.

Lyra has been captured by Mrs. Coulter and is being kept in a coma.  In it, she dreams of Roger in the Land of the Dead.  Will is desperate to find her and is relying on two reluctant angels to help him.  Mary Malone has traveled to an alternate world, met a new and unusual people, and will be instrumental in learning the nature of Dust. Lyra will reunite with Roger, but she and Pan will pay a tragic price.  All the while, Lord Asriel assembles an army to oppose The Authority and Mrs. Coulter continues to interfere in everything.  So yeah, a lot happens in this conclusion!

Pullman pretty much abandoned subtlety in the second book of the trilogy: the Church is an enemy of reason and will engage in evil, including assassination, to protect its power.  I see how people might view this series as an attack on religion. That didn't bother me, except that the author makes it very black and white. Everyone working for the Magisterium is evil, everyone else is free to fall into shades of gray (both good and bad, as people are won't to be).  This is unfortunate because it undermines the allegory hes trying to weave, which is why I gave it four stars instead of five.

Still, the revelations concerning the nature of Dust and why children are the key to the story were excellent and very satisfying. Innocence is a type of Grace, but experience is just as beautiful.  Reason makes us human. Overall, I thought the trilogy was excellent and with ideas that challenged me and kept me thinking long after the final page.

I liked the interactions between the characters in this book, especially Ophelia and the boy, and the interesting descriptions of the relationship between Ophelia and her sister. These characters reminded me somewhat of those in C.S. Lewis' novels. The abundant feeling of hope and friendship in this story made it one that I shall not soon forget.

One of the things that I particularly found appealing about this book was the way the characters discovered things. I thought the writing in these sections of the book was very original and did not follow the paths I had seen taken before. Items are important in this type of novel and in keeping with that idea, it was refreshing to see that the kids in this book had to use some intellect in order to solve their problems and find what they were looking for.

Children of all ages would enjoy this story. Long enough to keep an older child entertained, yet this book could be read in chapters to a younger child as well.

1124,"I read this book after seeing its glowing review in the New York Times Book Review, which described the book as ""unique"" and a ""beautiful, haunting love story."" And I believe this latter comment is probably accurate if you are 15. For grownups, the appeal is more limited.

This is the story of the relationship between a reasonably cool half-Asian boy and a poor, zaftig girl who sits next to him on the schoolbus in Omaha, Nebraska in the mid-1980s. We're not really told why they fall for each other, which is OK in this case because they don't really understand it themselves. Sometimes teenagers just fall for each other, as did Romeo and Juliet, and we shouldn't expect any more understanding than that.

The first fifty pages of the book, in which the social standing of Park and the politics of the schoolbus are dissected, work very well. Older readers will find themselves thinking back to our own high school experiences and asking ourselves how we would have behaved, and where we would have fit in the world of Eleanor and Park.

After that, it's less interesting. The parallels with Romeo and Juliet are quite heavy-handed (perhaps appropriately so for a teenaged reader but as a grownup, I've been to this balcony before). The ""big twist"" near the end has been so aggressively telegraphed that it would never have ocurred to me that it was intended as a surprise if it weren't referred to as such on the bookjacket. Most importantly, as a grownup, a relationship between a couple of teenages just isn't very interesting. Even Romeo and Juliet evolves pretty quickly into a sort of a thriller (how will they survive now that their clans are fighting?).

Amy, who was prematurely unfrozen, is trying to come to terms with life aboard the ship and misses her family and being on Earth. When it looks like they might be closer to their destination than anyone thought, she becomes excited and will do anything to get off the ship. Meanwhile Elder tries to be the best leader he can be, but was he born to lead?

I absolutely loved the first book, Across the Universe. I seem to read a lot of YA fantasy but not a lot of YA science fiction and that's part of my strong affection for this series. The other part is that the idea of leaving earth in Godspeed for another planet, hopefully a better planet, is such a fantastic idea and I've loved watching this play out.

For me, A Million Suns was even better than the first book. Across the Universe  set up the story and it really developed into a fast-paced thrilling story in A Million Suns. Through Elder and Amy we learn more about the secrets behind Godspeed and some of the secrets were definitely edge-of-the-seat earth-shattering! There were quite a few ""Oh My"" moments as I read faster and faster to the thrilling end.

I liked Elder a little less in A Million Suns. He needs to stand up and be a leader and he has to make some tough decisions, but there was something that didn't quite connect with me.

I was more than pleasantly surprised by this book, #5 in Harris' ""Vampire"" mystery series about Sookie Stackhouse, a ""gifted"" waitress with a penchant for danger and deadly (or should I say, dead) men.

Gothic appeal aside, this book was full of interesting characters, inventive plot twists, and out-of-the-ordinary occurrences -- including an Elvis sighting. I love an author who creates a world and pulls the reader into it completely, and Harris does that here.

1237,"I first became familiar with Sarah Vowell's work via her radio appearances on NPR's ""This American Life"". While she brings an unapologetically slightly left of center view to her work, she also brings the subjects she examines to vivid life in ways that are insightful, humorous and reflect strong academic discipline. While her overall approach may be not be appreciated by staid historiographers, for those looking to plug gaps in their knowledge of historical subjects: she is a great resource.

""Lafeyette in the Somewhat United States"" explores the role of the teenage general, Gilbert de Motier, Marquis de Lafayette in the American Revolution. Centered on Lafayette and his access to the military and financial might of France in assisting the US colonies, it expands in a series of other examinations, to include Lafayette's relationship with George Washington, the politics of colonial military command and the larger evolution of diplomatic relations between France and the colonies.

Vowell is very effective at providing context on what is really going on in the background of the rather staid documentary records of events from the late 18th century. She does this in ways that are often laugh out loud funny and useful for providing contexts on issues we face in the modern world.

I started placing dog ears on the funniest passages as I read...and then stopped, because she is witty at every turn, and she uses this wit to effectively illuminate what she writes about. About his arrival in Charleston, Vowell quotes Lafayette's letter: ""Everything around me was new...the room, the bed draped in delicate mosquito curtains, the black servants who to me quietly to ask my commands...the luxuriant vegetation..."". Then she provides this interpretation: ""In other words, it was a buggy swamp full of slaves."" While some might bristle at such irreverence, it has the undeniable quality of bringing life to the often stodgy presentation of traditional history.

I grew up in parts of New Jersey that the armies described in this book traversed while moving men and materials between New York and Philadelphia. No teacher or local historical society ever succeeded in bringing the history of the area to live as Sarah Vowell does here (although Annie Garvin came close!).

The U.S. Weather Service in September of 1900 ignored most reports of a severe hurricane brewing in the Caribbean.  Drawing upon a great deal of denial and no small amount of racism, the Americans condemned Cuban forecasts (which were also understated, but not nearly so heinously) as ""emotional,"" avoiding almost as a matter of faith ""poetic"" terms like ""eye"" (of the storm) or even ""Hurricane.""  The storm hit Galveston, Texas, dead-on, wiping out nearly a quarter of the city's 36,000 population.  While land-based telegraphy was advanced as to transmission of data, it bears remembering that radio-telegraphy still lay in the near future.  As much as possible of the narrative is told through the eyes of Isaac Cline, chief of the Galveston weather bureau.

As always, Erik Larson writes beautifully, at times brilliantly, and bases his non-fiction on vast and impeccable sources.  This is a wonderful book to read (though Texans who lived through the similar Harvey in 2017 may want to wait a while before picking up ISAAC'S STORM).

450,"Bernard Cornwell at his best is terrific.  He has a wonderful ability to reimagine what is not merely familiar, but rather stale.  The Arthurian Legend is a daunting task to recreate, but one definitely deserving of re-imagination.  When Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot devolve into a Lerner and Lowe musical, it's time for an extreme make over.  To be clear: I really admire the author, but not without reservation. He can drag a three part story out to seven (see the Uthred/Alfred the Great series).  Here, Cornwell actually benefits from the restrictions of the Arthurian legend, not being able to stray too far or natter on endlessly.  The Arthurian Legend also benefits from him: Cornwell pares back the overly Romanticized shlock and focuses on actual events or on events as they might have actually been.

In The Winter King Arthur's not yet king. He has no knights and he's not yet fashioned a round table.  Chaos reigns.  The Romans are gone, Britannia has disintegrated into turf warfare and Celts, Picts, Anglos, Saxons and Danes are more gangsta than government.  It is in this setting that one can imagine the yearning for security, calm and order.  Knights of the Round Table are more wishful thinking than reality; Gawains and Percivals a projection of what you're looking for from the man in charge. The idea that an unfaithful wife can disrupt the natural order of society is Romance (and misogyny)  in overdrive and has no place in this world.  Cornwell makes us understand that legend and romance are born from a riotous reality and need for security.

Whether it's what you imagine, this telling of Arthurian legend is entirely plausible, very entertaining and well worth reading.",4,"[-2.1893176222635398, -1.2399297750390876, -1.7252004935192031, -1.060169728728523, -1.0457367444455499]",-1.0457367444455499

I received an advanced copy from the author as part of a blog tour.

I had never heard of this author so I didn't really know what to expect going into this book! I really liked the look of it and was excited to get to read it.

I really enjoyed the characters in this story, they were all well developed and not one of them annoyed me which is a complete miracle.

I felt so bad for London, she was humiliated and had to go home to face everyone after her worldwide failure. The thing I liked most about London was the fact that she never whined about anything, she took it and yes she was a bit sad but she never got on like most heroines would have! I loved the relationship she had with her family and Alain Branson's family, it really warmed my heart.

I loved Branson, he was this hot alpha male cowboy what more could we ask for?? If only he could have threw a few y'alls into the mix!! Again the relationship he had with his family was beautiful and I would have loved to have heard a little more with them in it.

This was a nice light read, there were a few issues but nothing overly dramatic. I'm not usually a big fan of the insta love but to be honest it didn't bother me much in this book!

I really enjoyed this book, I think the writing was well done and the author kept me captivated with the story.

I just loved the tension between them in the previous installments, and I just knew things would be explosive between them once things finally boiled over. And explosive they were. The two of them were so combustible, it's a wonder the pages didn't burn up! There's just something to be said about all that build up and anticipation to make the story all the sweeter and well, hotter. Now don't get me wrong things aren't all steam in this book, and the road between them is anything but easy, in fact quite the opposite is true as the tension stayed pretty strong and heavy throughout the entire book. Nothing sucks me into a book more than sexual tension between characters, and these two had it in spades. Nothing came easy and it was an uphill battle of wills on both sides making for an absolutely delicious read.

This book would have been stellar for the romance alone, but when you add in the intense plot, it just took things right over the edge. The case Erin and Noah have been sent to solve is a doozy and one that hits way too close to home making it all the more personal.

It's a solid conspiracy thriller tying together Atlantis, the Nazis, mysticism, genetics, neuroscience, world terrorism, espionage, and more. Kate is a genetics researcher with a troubled past working on a cure for autism, while David is an intelligence operative whose fiance was killed in 9/11.

The writing is solid, though nothing outstanding in and of itself. It's a little stiff and contrived in parts (reminds me of Dan Brown) but it's not a distraction. Part of the backstory is told through an old journal, and for some reason, this is the best-written part of the book (which is a bit problematic since it's supposedly written by a coal miner.)

From the very first I had to admire Beth who left her home in Wisconsin to live with her Uncle and Aunt and cousin in Munich, Germany. Not at just any time, but during the time before and after America had declared war on Germany. As I learned more about her and the Quakers, to which she and her family belonged, I respected and valued her stand. Although I am not a Quaker the way they sat in quiet contemplation and prayer before big (or ideally, even small) decisions were made impacted my thoughts, and is something I would like to emulate.
The story is well written, and as hard as it was to wrap my mind around the things mentioned, I was compelled to read. It is not pretty, but a part of history that needs to be repeated again and again so that we do not become complacent. And I also wonder if this history is being repeated in some of the third world countries.

I found it of great interest that the day after I finished this novel, the extermination camp Sobibor, Poland was mentioned in two separate articles, one of which is in the Arizona Republic, which announced that Philip Bialowitz, who survived Sobibor, is going to schools to acquainted school children with what he endured.

After Stout died, an unknown writer named Robert Goldsborough was called upon to try and continue the series.

He did so brilliantly.

So much so, that it would probably be impossible for any but the most astute scholar to tell the difference between vintage Stout and ""upstart"" Goldsborough.

For 8 more novels, he kept the Wolfian canon flourishing and then...?

Many years passed and, except for a passing ""What ever happened to...?"" most of us just felt the day was over.

Then, about a year ago, Goldsborough was back with ""Archie meets Nero Wolfe"", and it was as if he'd never left.

Now, we have ""Archie in the Crosshairs""

It's good to have you back Mr G

Now, I have to make clear: These ARE vintage Wolfe, and vintage Wolfe is of his time and place which is NOT today.

2057,"Melody Carlson's The Christmas Pony features old-fashioned holiday fun, a sweet romance, and an adorable heroine named Lucy Turnbull.

  In this charming novella, eight-year-old Lucy shows the adults around her the power of childlike faith and even does a little match-making along the way. Think The House Without a Christmas Tree, Holiday Affair, or Miracle on 34th Street--throw in some hot cocoa in front of the wood stove--and you'll be in just the right mood to enjoy this story.

  Here's the set up: Lucy lives with her widowed mother and grandmother in Maple Grove, Arizona. It's 1937, and times are hard. Lucy's mama, Miriam, knits socks to trade for groceries and takes in laundry and borders to get by. Though Lucy knows they can't afford one more mouth to feed, she can't help but pray for a pony of her own. However, she also asks for something special for her mama . . .

  ""`Please, dear God,' she said finally, `help Mama to find her smile again.' Lucy could remember when Mama had the prettiest smile ever. Back when Daddy was still alive. But like Lucy's memories of her father, Mama's smile had faded some over the last few years. If Lucy couldn't have a pony for Christmas, she'd settle for Mama's smile instead.""

  When Lucy corrals two borders to rent rooms for the Christmas holiday, all she's hoping for is extra money to convince Mama they can feed a pony. But she and her mama receive so much more. I loved this heart-warming story! It's sure to become a classic!

Luke & Leia have rather small yet very important roles throughout the book.  A new character, Scarlet was introduced.  She has a sexy mysterious super hero feel to her.  She was a fun addition to the usual Original Trilogy cast.  I expect we will see more of her in the next book.

Despite this Han preservers against ever growing odds.

The mystery of what happened to the protagonist's grandfather, first in the refugee home where as a young man he had spent the early years of WWII, then in the final days of his life, and how these are connected, drives the reader through chapter after chapter. It's most very well written, with some novel and excellent turns of phrase (comparing a beautiful morning to a sample desktop picture on a new computer, for example). And the mostly subtle but totally valid parallels between the experiences of Jews in Germany before and during the war, with the experiences of the mysterious creatures our protagonist Jacob finds in the present day. It's better written and more sophisticated than, say The Passage, or The Hunger Games, or Harry Potter.

The narrative traces Elizabeth's imprisonment by her sister Mary, Mary's death and her enthronement, through her tempestuous relationship with Robert Dudley (played consummately by Tom Hardy, portrayed as a very self-centered and arrogant man) and the emergence of Mary Queen of Scots as a rival, though unlike The Golden Age, where Mary plays a large role, in this version she is never actually shown, only discussed. A lot of the events are portrayed in discussion or letters as is the death of Dudley and the defeat of the Spanish Armada, though a stirring recreation of Elizabeth's speech to the troops at Tilbury is a highlight of the film. The film does well in it's use of real quotes together with more modern usage of conversation. Great costumes and scenery

The death of Amy Robsart (Emila Fox) , Dudley's wife is portrayed as s suicide, though one that Dudley reacts callously to and the Elizabeth's rivalry with Lettice Knollys (Sienna Gillory) is part of the focus.
The last part deals with Elizabeth devotion to the young Robert Devereaux (Hans Mattheson) , Earlf of Essex, and frames Essex plot against Elizabeth as being intigated by his mother Lettice.
Anne Marie Duff portrays Elizabeth quite expertly. Effortlessly playing the role of a young Elizabeth through to her aging and death. Elizabeth is revealed as wise, strong, devoted to her country and people, at times capricious and ruthless when necessary. Her anguish at being forced to sign the death warrant of Mary Queen of Scots is revealed in a dream of herself being executed in Mary's place. Quite a lot of her life  is revealed in this film in dreams, such as her desire for Robin Dudleywhere she dreams of making love to him.

Cons - it is expensive, I'm not sure the angles that 3M claims are accurate, and it's not removable, which is a waste of the lovely Macbook display.  Personally, I'd give this product a pass.",4,"[-1.3647331410116268, -1.2094605546524515, -1.216477556562465, -1.0580450638467578, -1.2507760247867659]",-1.0580450638467578

If you are interested in a book that is thoroughly, laugh out loud entertaining chick lit then this is for you.  Although there was some back story missing from the development of Maryse's character; the gradual revelations about her Mother-in-law Helena Henry was great.  The bitchiness of Helena coupled with the difficulties she faces being dead are just hilarious!  I actually think that Helena Henry was the star of this book.  Enjoyed and would recommend to others who could enjoy some light entertaining reading.",3,"[-2.37572568908824, -1.426703439559534, -1.4080627486192547, -1.0580917105630636, -1.2237798177333064]",-1.0580917105630636

9387,"You've seen Monster and thought it was a fantaastic film. Imagine an imperfect monster with one of your favourite actresses, Maggie. The film is a watered down Monster and there are many disturbing things about the character's life.

On the DVD cover, one finds a strong and independent woman, this I found to be a bit misleading. I know many people have recommended this film to me and it's the sort of film that sits right down my alley but there is absolutely no hope I saw in this film of recovering from it's misery.

The storyline is just sad and though it's been played out quite well my Maggie Gylenhaal, I feel I could've lived without this film and this would be my least favourite Maggie Gyl film.

I would recommend you renting this but it's not something you'd own and ever watch again. And if you would, I would consider throwing a quarter of affection in your direction, love.",2,"[-1.2325683538146035, -1.0650118851284551, -1.2891907480330458, -1.0692292443139457, -1.1038607435774943]",-1.0650118851284551

3773,"That was not what I expected. Having only read the blurb once months ago I was thrown off a bit and had to stop mid chapter to see what I was getting myself in to.

This was truly a heartbreaking story. I felt for Mikki and Crush almost the entire story. They both have their demons and man are they serious. Their journey, the flashback scenes were at times a bit much to handle. I had my bouts of anger and understanding. There were moments where I honestly had tears in my eyes at some of the things happening.

Overall I thought this was a good powerful story.",3,"[-3.2962145177787, -1.120722846016645, -1.2508750788912144, -1.0677531548759456, -1.089525296619707]",-1.0677531548759456

There was so much happening that I honestly thought it was going to be a rushed ending when I got around the 85% mark. I thought some things were unnecessary but in the end it was summed up well.

Good series.",3,"[-2.4113730029370144, -1.191268373845013, -1.197862562842262, -1.0749264437486903, -1.3239481372076745]",-1.0749264437486903
9466,"An aspiring young filmmaker spent a short time in 1956 on the set of a Laurence Olivier and Marilyn Monroe film as an assistant director. He became close to Marilyn as many men had, and ended up a key figure in the production. Marilyn Monroe was notoriously difficult to work with in Hollywood and that is well-dramatized here. Michelle Williams IS Marilyn Monroe in this one and her performance highlights a realistic look at the difficulties that Marilyn had with trying to be a serious Hollywood actress while dealing with her insecurities and a prescription drug habit. This film was a pleasant surprise and another terrific movie to see during the holiday season.",3,"[-3.679525263580963, -1.5018999431184503, -1.1844282127211596, -1.078752724217421, -1.2278170409152527]",-1.078752724217421
