7370,This bra fits as expected and looks very pretty with the ribbon straps and the lace band. The cups are demi cups so they don't provide full coverage. This is a push up bra so it creates a nice shape with a bit of cleavage. This bra despite the lace band is a good T-Shirt bra due to the smooth cups. The straps are also adjustable and can be made no slip or criss-cross for racer back tops. It's a comfortable bra to wear and can be worn for longer periods of time without discomfort.,3,"[-2.314896110895323, -1.158103248166181, -1.2806326952864429, 0.8719705995514904, -0.3616598274852558]",0.8719705995514904

9471,"I suppose this is how the world looks to an egotistical stoner of limited education.

That's the only way to explain RED STATE, the latest film from Kevin Smith.  A film we won't be seeing at a theatre near you.  A film that doesn't have one believable scene in it.  A film without a single sympathetic character in situations where we might care whether they survive or not.

By calling his film RED STATE and focusing on a sect of religious lunatics, Smith is clearly pandering to the political landscape of Hollywood, picking on the rubes and playing every stereotype he can exploit.  But his writing is still limited and juvenile.  Seasoned FBI Agents talk with the same uneducated dialogue as the stupid, horny teenagers.  Religious zealots end up cursing like stupid, horny teenagers.  In fact, everyone, as usual, ends up talking like Kevin Smith...or how he thinks they should talk while saddled with the vocabulary and thought processess of stupid, horny teenagers.

Unfortunately, Smith ends up equating the FBI with the religious fanatics.  Does Smith honestly believe that phone calls are made from Washington telling Field Agents to slaughter everyone at a hostage situation, including women and children, just to keep things quiet?  What a muddled mess of legal procedures clutter the second half of this movie!

Before watching this film tonight, I saw an article in the press where Smith trashed the Independent Spirit Awards in a profanity-laced tirade via Twitter because RED STATE wasn't nominated for anything.  I'm guessing he's the only one surprised by this.

Never before have I seen someone go so far on so little and still have a career.  And RED STATE will probably never make it out of the red.  Awful.",3,"[0.2215724607183922, -1.4194646522812686, -0.9079907442253549, 0.8711712912257551, -1.3128062049154487]",0.8711712912257551

519,"I found this book much more engaging than McCullough's bio of John Adams.  Of the founding fathers' bios that I have read, Hamilton may be the one I would most like to have spent a long dinner listening to his ideas and political concerns.  Part of his quality is his underdog status.  A poor immigrant who was probably the only founding father to personify the American hope of rags-to-riches.

As with almost all the other founding fathers, whose biographies I have read, Thomas Jefferson played a significant role.  As with some of these founding fathers, Jefferson played a villainous role.  I am still trying to find enough reason to glorify Jefferson, but the guy needed a good kick in the rear.

Chernow provides excellent refutation of the Jeffersonian inspired negative images of Hamilton as an enemy of democracy and an aristocrat.  In a manner that would have made Hamilton proud, the author seems to take pleasure in noting the hypocrisy of the aristocratic Jefferson, and Madison attacking Hamilton who actually put his life on the line to win independence from Britain, and who may have been the first to have called for the Constitutional Convention to make this land into an actual country.  If the British ever saw Jefferson, it was only to glimpse the back of his horse as he fled to the hills at the first sight of a redcoat.

Less happy for Hamilton is the author's honest assessment of Hamilton's weaknesses, of which there were many.  This is why any current day opponents of Hamilton (e.g., state rights exponents) would have to agree that this is a well-balanced treatment of its subject.  After finishing this book, I concluded that Hamilton would have been the brightest, and hardest working president in history, but his temperament would have surely doomed his administration.

Hopefully, text book writers will incorporate the information in this book and give proper status for our students of this incredible, but flawed man.",3,"[-1.7729710790856807, -1.0737878519230355, -0.8741258270411065, 0.8704290209032471, -1.2284143446398903]",0.8704290209032471

The heater has two heat settings at low and high and is fairly quiet even at the high setting. There is no setup at all and you just plug it in and it is ready to go.

It has a mild pleasant taste that does not overwhelm any sauce, cooks to al dente when one follows the directions, and is made from whole grains that add fiber to ones diet.

Barilla makes several kinds of pastas and I have to admit, I like every one of them.  I use the veggies in one recipe with chicken, and the protein plus in some others.  I like the whole grain pasta best for my spaghetti, but have now tried it in other pasta shapes in other Italian dishes and it has exceeded my expectations.

This is not your typical journal where you have a blank page with lines (or without lines) and you have to come up with something to write.

1981,"Despite a bit too much rah rah spirit about men yearning to get into combat before the war ended, this book is quite good and quite well researched.  Gandt gives the Japanese as well as the American perspective and shows that while the two were engaged in the same ugly race war, they were fighting it in two distinct ways.  The Japanese stressed strength of individual commitment to battle and willingness to sacrifice one's life for the emperor; the Americans massed superior firepower and stressed excellent training and preparation, particularly for pilots.

The best aspect of the book is its excellent discussion of the Kamikaze offensive.  In the popular imagination of Americans, the offensive was minor and fruitless.  Strategically, the offensive could not win the war or deter the Americans.  But tactically we should not underestimate the effectivenss of the Kamikazes.  They sunk 100 ships and killed thousands of men.  Enough of their planes could get through defense screens, fighters, and anti-aircraft fire.  And hitting the deck with 500 pound bombs was very effective.  The problem was that the ill-trained fighters went for low value targets like destroyers and gun boats.  The better tactic would have been to hit carriers.  However, they did a lot of damage to Intrepid and Enterprise -- the wooden flight decks were quite vulnerable.

Unfortunately for the Japanese, they lost 4,000 planes in the campaign and were not in a position to replace them.

Also interesting is the discussion of the last campaign of Yamato, the greatest battleship in history.  In response to the Emperor's question, ""Where is the Navy"", the admirals sent their most prized ship on a ridiculous suicide mission against land forces in Okinawa.  It lacked any air cover and was quickly spotted and destroyed.

As Cheri, she gives a dazzling performance of 'Black Magic', and it's great listening to her in her hillbilly accent. The final scenes where her face take up the entire screen was great directing and she looked as beautiful as an angel. Her comic timing was delivered perfectly, and the costumes she wore in this movie lead to some of her greatest still photograph.
So why only 4 stars? The rest of the cast did a great job, Virg, Elma, Grace, and Carl. Who did I leave out? That's right, Bo. Don Murray single-handedly ruins this movie. His cowboy mannerisms are waaaay over the top, he overacts every scene he's in, he's rude, stupid, and to tell you the truth, Marilyn ending up with him is so unbelievable, it makes you just want to scratch your head.
Now I know that Bo was supposed to be an inexperienced cowboy right off the ranch, but no one is going to arrive in a city and acts like he owns the world. Kidnapping a woman (with a lasso of all things) and dragging her on the bus is a stretch, but when Bo finally gets his butt kicked by Carl, and learns a lesson in humility, and then Marilyn falls for him, well... I can't believe someone would give up their Hollywood dreams and go to a ranch with a doous like Bo.

9347,"I really liked this film.  This film offers something much more than the usual ""southern people are inbreeders, racists, and homophobes"".  It shows a complicated man, played by Robert Duvall, who is not a perfect man, but who is in fact, well, he did something that's a felon, we'll say.  But here he is desperately trying to redeem himself and that of his small flock in a small town in Louisiana.  This is a really wonderful, sincere, and at times, spellbinding film, one that shows a much more nuanced, complex, and quite moving portrayal of the deep South, something that Hollywood never offers.  Films that show the complexities of faith really scare Hollywood and the left, as they dismiss anyone of the Chrisitian faith as a right winger hater.  While many calling themselves Christians (preachers of the ilk of Falwell and James Dobson) embrace the ""god hates fags and abortions"" line (and ignore everything else in the gospel), they do so simply to attain political power more than anything else, and have no real desire to help their fellow man spiritually.

It gives them ideas on how to fill other people's buckets and keep their own bucket full as well.  It also goes into bucket dipping, or trying to steal someone else's happiness.  Bucket dipping never works because when you empty someone else's happiness bucket, yours empties too.

For one thing - the display on this watch does not show climb (although you can download your information after completing a run and see it online).

Also, the band is not great for persons like me with very small wrists. I find the thickness of the band makes it hard to put on (and I only wear it when running).

Lastly, the feature I dislike the most (and now even more since I had the chance to try out the Garmin Forerunner 35, which, btw, has an excellent display but a substandard heart rate monitor) is the size of the display for the Lap feature (which shows notifies you, say, as you reach each mile).

9402,"It's hard to imagine a better trilogy of films more suitable for Blue Ray than the Jason Bourne movies. Each film looks absolutely fantastic, the sound is spot on, and the films themselves are masterpieces by thriller standards. Bourne has become iconic; the Bond of the new generation. Matt Damon's all-american good looks, intensity, and acting skills give the films a credibility that many movies search for but never find.

There are so many reasons to buy this collection. The transfer quality is nearly perfect in my opinion, but I am not the type to watch the films with a magnifying glass and look for any tiny mistakes. The surround sound is simply unreal. John Powell's score really comes to life and the depth of the sound effects are fantastic. The scene in Ultimatum that takes place in Waterloo Train Station is epic and should go down in cinema history as one of the best cat-and-mouse chase scenes ever made. The storyline is well constructed, believable, and leaves you hungry for more.

Thankfully, there is a fourth Bourne movie in the works, with both Damon and director Paul Greengrass returning to make sure it is done right. I can't wait.

There are few movies I will watch again and again, and these make that very short list. The best trilogy since the GODFATHER movies (sorry STAR WARS fans), these are a no brainer for any movie fan. 5/5 stars.

2144,"This is a thoughtful and well-researched analysis of the great battle as well as its larger context.

Regarding the battle, O'Connell points out that from the vantage point of the field, the Romans did not see the trap sprung by Hannibal -- they lacked the depth perception to see that Hannibal was strong on the flanks.  Thus the Romans rushed in and the center gave way enough to create a pocket that was quickly enveloped by Hannibal's two wings.  Hemmed in, only the Roman forces on the exterior could put up a fight.  They were overwhelmed by the numbers of the Carthaginians; when they fell, the newly exposed forces were then cut down.  Tens of thousands of Romans were hacked to death in this fashion.

But O'Connell is more interested in the political as opposed to the military questions raised by the conflict.  By the rules of the game then prevailing in Mediterranean conflicts, Rome should have given up and made peace with Hannibal.  But winning the war, as opposed to a battle, is a political act.  Politically and culturally, the Romans could not accept defeat.  They were better suited than the Carthaginians in mobilizing for war and wearing down the opponent.  The Carthaginians were better suited for commerce than for war.  In Hannibal they were lucky enough to have a great commander who could make them outperform themselves militarily.  But that was not enough to win the war.  The Romans learned from Hannibal.  Scipio Africanus survived the battle and learned to fight smart rather than simply to overwhelm an opponent.  He skillffully moved his forces and took the offensive; he didn't fall for any of Hannibal's tricks and ended up winning the final battle of the Second Punic War.

Another thesis of O'Connell is that there were several thousand survivors of the battle who learned from their defeat and who avenged themselves in the final battle of the war.

There is a dimmer to adjust the brightness to your preference.  Also of utmost importance is setting or resetting the time.

The manual explains everything clearly and simply and a quick slide to the DST Switch added the hour I needed.  The buzzer is an excellent volume for me and the radio comes in great with a total of 20 available presets.  You can use the aux in jack to connect external audio for playback and finally there is a usb port to charge any device you need to.

What's in the box?:  You receive a tiny receiver, plus a pretty small power bubble which is micro-USB based and provides the power and the small instruction booklet.

Set-up?:  Here it is quite easy.  You simply plug everything in, and use the small micro-USB cord to your device and everything is ready to be used. Using your device, say a computer with bluetooth enabled or a phone, tablet or other device with bluetooth, simply use settings to connect and the device is ready.  You can plug this in, or use another USB plug on a stereo receiver for example to provide power.  Use the headphone jack (mini-jack) to accommodate your device and you are ready to go.

Use?:  Once set-up is accomplished, and this shouldn't be a difficult issue, I used this with IOS airplay to good result.  The connection is very good and it just works without an issue.

Likes:  Unlike other devices, this is a 'digital'[ device such that no need for an RCA plug!  I love the small size.  This device is about the size of a half-dollar and about as thick as a Oreo cookie.  It is pretty small.  I like the connection it provides.

Cons: For what it is, this provides lots of versatility.  Although bluetooth is becoming standard, using this enables those older devices to be utilized.

All the songs are classics here but none of them were really hits. 'Roadhouse Blues' is a killer tune and one of the best songs The Doors ever recorded. 'Waiting On The Sun' is a killer song about the American dream as only Jim Morrison could right, its very psycadelic. My favorite song on the album is with out a doubt the killer funky rocker 'Peace Frog' this is one of their best songs and one of Robby Kreiger's best guitar solos. Robby Kreiger is with out a doubt one of the most underrated guitar players of all time! Other stand out tracks are 'Blue Sunday' and 'Ship Of Fools' both of which are killer songs. The rest of the album is amazing but these songs stick out the most to me.

The Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox scenes work better than any of the overly mushy stuff from Pearl Harbor or Armageddon though.

The one we care more about here more than Optimus Prime even is Shia LaBeouf's first car Bumblebee which actually steals the show. The action and effects are fantastic but there's too many scenes with soldiers in the way shooting at the Decepticons eventhough....their weapons barely do anything to them!

  Plus when the Transformers collide the action isn't as good as it could be. They basically can just clunk together. Their fights in the cartoon show were of course better. Plus the movie does the Autobots more justice than it does the Decepticons. We mostly just get to know the Autobots and the super cool Megatron doesn't even appear until like the last 20 minutes.

Fearing certain death and the loss of their race, they sent nine Guarde (those with Legacies) to Earth.  These nine were accompanied by their Cepan (keepers) to help teach them and hone their skills once their Legacies (powers) presented.  The nine are the only hope of Lorien's future.  Once they gain their powers, they will be strong enough to defeat the Mogadorians and return to help rebuild Lorien.

An enchantment was put on the nine upon their departure from Lorien.  As long as they stay separate, they can only be killed in order.  When one of them dies, a scar is burned into the flesh of all the remaining.  John Smith just got his third scar.  He is number four.  They will come for him next.  John and Henri (his Cepan) are constantly on the run moving from one small town to another.  They have to keep one step ahead of the Mogadorians or face death.  They must constantly change their identities and keep a low profile so no one suspects where they are; that's easier said than done when you're in high school in a small town and you have super powers.

This was a fun read.  It sounds like there are great possibilities with John's story and the rest of the nine.  There are any number of Legacies that they could present with which could make for great stories.

I find the pillow very comfortable to sleep on while laying on my back, the part that goes under the neck supports perfectly and my head is cradled in the hollow part in the center.

The part I have trouble with is when sleeping on my side - you are supposed to lay your head on the sides of the pillow, not in the center where the hollow part is.  I didn't understand this until I read the instruction sheet that came with the pillow.

The foam that is in the sides is super comfortable - I just wish there was more if it, it's a very narrow strip to lay your head on, especially if you share a bed with somebody.  I'm either sleeping way on the edge of the bed or right in my husband's face if my head is laying on just one side of the pillow, so obviously it's a bit awkward.

I am not a scientist, and when a friend tells me so and so is a great doctor, I translate that to myself to mean my friend likes his/her doctor.  How do we judge?  Clearly, 50% of all doctors graduated in the bottom half of their medical schools.  Not that that, in and of itself is a necessary determinant of whether or not someone is a good physician.  But what is?
Dr. Gawande uses many anecdotes to show how the nascent science of improving performance amongst medical professionals is the key to longer, healthier lives.
Gawande asks hard questions of his profession, as well as of himself: if he's an average surgeon, should he be trusted with someone's life, or their child's life?  Shouldn't we have a right to know how our doctors rate, when there are objective standards that can be applied to performance?
Fairview Children's Hospital in Missouri treats patients with Cystic Fibrosis.  The patients who are seen at that hospital, consistently outlive patients seen at other hospitals who have the same condition.
Gawande argues that data, such as that, should be readily available both to patients and their families, so they can make informed choices about their care, but also for doctors so they can improve their own performance.

These poor beings are moved into what can only be described as shanty towns and forced to survive off of garbage and government supplied food which is substandard.  Also for some reason they really like cat food.  I don't know why, but that really made me laugh!

The story overall is really good and it makes you think about an racist ideas you have in your own head and makes you took a long look at yourself.  When a movie can do that and show you how some of your own ideas may be wrong and how you should change, that to me is not only entertainment, but it's also helping you grow as a person.

Considering the way that world events have been going since 1948 and especially since the 1960's, I found a great deal of accuracy in the way the subject was presented in this miniseries. The responses to the various disasters and events portrayed seemed to be very natural and logical, but of course they were not. That being said the movie gives a pretty accurate insight  to the goings on of the world (antichrist) leader. I think that its more than very important that people today take a very long, hard look and world events and the current events that have taken place in this country since the 60's. My only problems with this movie was the way that the rapture was portrayed. It will be far more than just the disappearance of children. It will be of all believers in Christ. The other problem was dealing with the return of Christ. That will be the most important event in human history and yet the event was not shown. Instead the movie ended one year after Christ's return and did not show what the earth and human life will be like.

Well, there may be some name-calling in his latest book, but the most ridiculous ranting and name-calling come from the people Goldberg cites.  A lot I'd heard of, some I hadn't.

As far as the liberals dismissing Goldberg and even attacking him, they're just exposing their own bitterness and intolerance.  They learned from the masters of the Politics of Personal Destruction themselves, the Clinton Administration.  (Pointing out Ted Kennedy's past of womanizing, drunkeness, even criminal behavior that resulted in an empolyee's death--then quoting him as the moral ""conscience"" of the Senate, especially on women's issues--is not partisanship, it's just simple comprehension).

But 100 PEOPLE WHO ARE SCREWING UP AMERICA can't be so easily categorized or limited as one side's rant against the others.  Howard Stern, who actively campaigned for John Kerry last fall, is right next to Michael Savage, radio's pitbull opposite of Stern.

By reading this book, you should realize that the people listed in this book aren't there because of which side of any issue they stand on, they're here because they really, really should've put some thought into how they express themselves.

- Very roomy.  Will easily fit assorted tupperware containers, and a can or bottled drink, with ease.
- Insulated
- Very pretty design.  The design is made with photographs of real tree branches.

Cons:
- Insulation is not as thick as I've seen on other lunch bags
- Not very well padded.  I'd be worries about my lunch getting smushed.
- No dividers or reinforced sides.  I'd be worried about softer fruits getting squished.

At approximately $5 I think this is quite a good deal, but if you're looking for a high-end lunch pack, you'll be disappointed",3,"[-2.87303834755357, -1.6075881650599553, -0.8370311279061211, 0.8491426508079151, -0.8775416591407821]",0.8491426508079151

Her story contains controversy, conflict, and challenges within a detailed historical context and a cast of interesting characters, and I really loved how Jill Eileen Smith brings it to life.

Both have come to enjoy their human charges--and the unexpected decisions they make. Well, yes, the world really is a sort of Chessboard where God and Satan play out their game, but it's a nice Chessboard, and Crowley and Aziraphale would miss it if it were gone.

When Crowley gets word that the time has come, the Anti-Christ is ready for delivery, he knows better to disobey orders. He drops the infant at the hospital run by Satanic nuns and authorizes the switch. Neither he, nor Aziraphale expect the minor mixup--the infant Anti-Christ going to a working class English couple rather than to the American diplomat scheduled to receive him. Prophesy keeps its schedule, of course--helped along by the ""Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch."" The four riders of the apocalypse (with pollution replacing plague) don't require ancient Biblical battlegrounds to create the end of the world--they can do their work from well-connected Air Force bases on English soil. And with his power suddenly awakening, and filled with visions of UFOs, environmental destruction, hollow earth, and Tibetan tunnels spanning the globe, Adam Young, the Anti-Christ, is ready to create a new world--a better world where his three friends can each rule continents.

Authors Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett combine to create a story that is simultaneously laugh-out-loud funny and highly thoughtful.

Gaiman and Pratchett deliver plenty of British humor and the type of offbeat characters that make their works so popular.

That may be true in some instances, but what I didn't realize until I tried this toothbrush was that most people probably love their electric toothbrushes because they work so much better than a traditional toothbrush.  I'm tickled that every time I use this toothbrush I get that 'just came from the dentist' clean feeling.

I love pretty much all of the features on this brush - the different brushing speeds, and the built-in 'timer' that alerts you to brush a different area of your mouth.  I don't think they could have made cleaning your teeth much simpler!  I love how easy it is to take the brush off the base and put it back on when you're done, and the little covered storage area to store extra brush heads.  I was very pleased to find Target-brand brush-heads that can be used with this brush, I purchased five heads for the price of 3 of the brand-name ones.

The only feature I don't really find necessary (for me at least) is the red light indicator that flashes if you're using too much pressure when you brush.  I tried it just to see what it does, and you have to push REALLY hard with the brush against your teeth for the light to come on, I can't imagine most people normally brush that hard.  So for me this was not a necessary option, it's just there though and doesn't interfere with the use of the brush in any way.

My Monopoly is made to personalize and become a memento, a one of a kind gift, or just a fun way for everyone to get involved. This edition game comes with a special board, cards and pieces, so that you can personalize as much as you want with the printable enclosed stickers. The game board can also be played without the personalized streets and if you don't want to personalize the Chance cards and Community Chest cards, no problem. They have the information/instructions printed where your sticker would go. To print out the stickers, there is a downloadable app as well as a website where you can design them online.

This game has been as much fun to personalize as it is to play. The photos we've chosen have really made it fun and OURS - no one has a game like this anywhere!

So why only 4 stars? The game board is not the nice one fold board, but instead, a split board that folds down into fourths. I'm not a fan of this type of board as it doesn't sit totally flat and is not as durable as the single fold. Also, this game only has enough pieces for 4 players, so those with larger families may want to take note to possibly prevent hurt feelings when all the children can't play at once.

The straps look like rubber gaskets like you would use in plumbing and then there are 2 tie straps that are used everyday so nothing special. You can't use another phone case with this since the locking device is built into the case. If you lose the gaskets, you should be able to find them in a hardware store easily, so the price here is for the phone case and lock and I think it's just way too much for what you are getting ($70 at the time of this writing).  The case is nice but not that big a deal and you have to take the top off to listen to your music and take a picture (what a bummer, eh). The mount is small and simply made so I can't figure out what is so costly to make this.

One thing worth noting is that unlike most breakfast bars this one is not very sweet so it got a bit of a mixed reaction in my household. I'd say it's more of an adult taste with crunch, chewy texture and prominence of grains at the forefront followed by the hints of sweetness from the cane syrup, honey and fruit puree (blueberry and apple).

When I went to visit my mother-in-law in Florida, I discovered that she had purchased a medical alert bracelet that required an Internet connection. The main unit for the medical device, required that the single Ethernet cable she had, be plugged into the back of the unit. Since I wanted to use my laptop computer, and there was no wireless connection available, I wasn't sure what to do. My brother-in-law, who lives in the same condo complex, let me use his computer to search for something on Amazon that would solve the problem. After searching for a while; I came across this Ethernet switch made by Lynksys and made the purchase.

Setting it up couldn't have been easier. First I plugged the Ethernet switch into a wall outlet. Than, I removed the main Ethernet cable from the medical device and plugged it into port number one on the switch. Next, I plugged the medical device into port number two. Finally, I plugged my laptop into port number three. The only extra items that I had to purchase were two 6' Ethernet cables which I used for the medical device and my laptop computer. The entire set-up took less than 5 minutes and the results were exactly what I had hoped for. I'm able to use my laptop computer at the same time that my mother-in-law's medical device is in use.

9625,"The Helix Angle and Circle Maker is a simple but clever tool to use to draw circles.  For years, I've relied on tracing various objects or subjecting my journals to the pointed end of a protractor in order to achieve the perfect circle.  This handy little circle maker consists of a ring with a movable center plastic piece.  To use, you simply place your pencil or pen in one of the little holes in the plastic piece then draw where the plastic piece guides you.  You can also use the precut circles to trace smaller circles.  The center guide moves fairly smoothly, but does require a firm hand so that the circles come out neatly.  I would not recommend using this device with very thin tipped pens.  I used a Micron 03 pen with this circle maker, but I wouldn't go any thinner than that.

While this circle maker did work with my Leuchttum 1917 Bullet Journal, I will warn you that it does take a steady hand to use since there is a book gutter to deal with.  While these journals do lay quite flat, I did have some issues with getting it to lay flat enough so that the inner circle would work smoothly.

Because the spout is at the bottom and the fill hole is at the top, you can't set these on a flat surface to refill, you have to hold them, which is awkward and makes them easy to drop. 75% of they time a bottle is dropped, unless it's completely empty, it will break.

""Prince Caspian"" is darker than ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,"" and might be scary for some children. It has some fairly frightening scenes in it, so be forewarned.

What is fantastic about this collection is the sheer quality of the blue-ray picture.

There is also a micro-HDMI to HDMI cable for smaller devices such digital cameras, and the most common HDMI to HDMI cable for connecting a AV receiver or Blu-ray player to the HDTV. Make sure you order the correct cable for you needs.

The cable is well made. It feels hefty and solid and yet flexible enough to bend and route through tight corners. The connectors are gold-plated and sturdy. They have a rather small plastic casing that should not block or otherwise interfere with other connectors in the input section of your device.

I have tested this cable on my DSLR to TV connection without any problems.

While Robin Williams voice performance is plenty funny, the Genii character doesn't even get past 1 dimensional.

Any coffee connoisseur will tell you, good full bodied coffee with true taste and aroma comes from french press. Especially for the gourmet coffees there is a huge difference. This press is sleek looking, durable due to stainless steel construction and easy to clean or set up in dishwasher as there is less danger of breakage. However, the handle tends to get really hot as it's all steel and care needs to be taken not to burn yourself due to hot surfaces.

I've got 3 other french presses - 2 Bodums and one other stainless steel (no brandname). The Bodum had a better mesh to filter the coffee, that kept grounds out of the coffee. This mesh is a little thinner and may be less durable in the longer term. For now, it's holding up well and keeping the grounds out of my cup. The single wall container cools coffee pretty fast so it's best to make one large cup of coffee, and not go back for seconds. However, a tea cozy can partly solve that problem.

The U.S. Weather Service in September of 1900 ignored most reports of a severe hurricane brewing in the Caribbean.  Drawing upon a great deal of denial and no small amount of racism, the Americans condemned Cuban forecasts (which were also understated, but not nearly so heinously) as ""emotional,"" avoiding almost as a matter of faith ""poetic"" terms like ""eye"" (of the storm) or even ""Hurricane.""  The storm hit Galveston, Texas, dead-on, wiping out nearly a quarter of the city's 36,000 population.  While land-based telegraphy was advanced as to transmission of data, it bears remembering that radio-telegraphy still lay in the near future.  As much as possible of the narrative is told through the eyes of Isaac Cline, chief of the Galveston weather bureau.

As always, Erik Larson writes beautifully, at times brilliantly, and bases his non-fiction on vast and impeccable sources.  This is a wonderful book to read (though Texans who lived through the similar Harvey in 2017 may want to wait a while before picking up ISAAC'S STORM).  I do wish that visuals in this book had included more than a very basic map of the Gulf of Mexico and adjoining landmass, and a map of Galveston.

It was next to another LED Tv that cost around $200 more, but I went with the vizio anyways thinking I could change the settings to make it work.

I got it home in the back of my honda ridgeline truck, it fit perfectly in the bed with the tailgate closed, we got it carried upstairs easily with the wifes help and unboxed it. The TV is massive and when you first turn it on it walks you through a setup wizard.

Once the TV was up and running the picture was good, but not great. At least not for watching Hockey. I went into the settings and found the TV had many sport modes, but hockey was not one of them!

451,"Cheers to author Mark Bowden.  Thanks to his incredibly dedicated research and excellent storytelling ability, he was able to  resurrect the quickly fading memory of America's military ""debacle"" in Somalia and give the troops who fought (and died) there their proper due.  For the most part, Bowden doesn't get bogged down with the details of WHY the U.N. and American troops were in Somlaia in the first place (though he does give enough of an overview to set the proper context), nor does he go in depth  into how Somalia descended into lawlessness.  Bowden's story is of the soldiers, and it is a story he tells as well as any combat chronicler has ever done.
Bowden focusses on the soldiers of Delta Force and of the U.S. Army Rangers who on October 3, 1993, were sent on a daylight mission ointo the section of Mogadishu controlled by Warlord Mohamed Aidid two apprehend two of Aided's top lieutenants.  Despite popular perceptions (fueled by the media) that the mission was a disaster, it was actually a tactical success.  The force captured its targets and at the same time inflicted tremendous casualties (many times their own) on Aided's forces.  Unfortunately, the political leadership in the U.S. and the American media focussed intead on the two downed Blackhawk helicopters and the deaths of 18 soldiers.  What was overlooked was the fact that the American casualties were among America's most elite fighters who had all volunteered to join the units they were in with the expectation that they would someday get tested in real combat.  Bowden drives this point home relentlessly.
The battle scens in the book are incredibly detailed and told from every point of view (even that of the Somalis, some of whom Bowden interviewed).  Bowden is also scrupulously fair, letting the participants speak for themselves and not censoring them when they criticize each other.  The book's most valuable portion, however, is the epiloge, where Bowden reports the soldiers' biggest disappointment was that right after the battle,  President Clinton, pushed by Congress, decided to get out of Somalia and leave Aidid in place.  In other words, they had fought the battle in vain.
Overall, ""Black Hawk Down"" is one of the best military history books written in the past decade or so.",3,"[-1.5778246302273784, -1.7812548478068062, -1.2312344102946748, 0.8352405052756581, -0.36272714748553636]",0.8352405052756581

713,"A big issue with this Bible is obviously the updated translation.  I don't think a product review is the place to discuss dynamic equivalence or the pros and cons of different translation strategies.  If it's something that concerns you, I would just google ""2011 NIV changes"" and you'll see tables of changes that were made to this revision and you can decide for yourself.

I do just want to say that I don't love gender inclusive language, but was not concerned with the changes made to the 2011 NIV.  Honestly, I thought the language was changed for the better (e.g. their goal, to make it more colloquial).  Languages change dramatically over time and if your goal is dynamic equivalence, then these changes are on target.

So like most people I don't love change in general, but I wasn't offended by any of the changes I looked at (there are a lot of them and I didn't read anywhere near all of them though).

Having said that, the study portion of this Bible is PHENOMENAL.  It's full color with amazing pictures, graphs and charts. I love the pictures of different archeological artifacts, landscapes, maps, etc. really bring the study portion to life.  The layout is fantastic and readable, the print is a nice size and the pages are thicker than you would expect.  It's really unlike any other Bible I've ever seen.

Obviously it would take a long time to read all the study notes, but if it's similar to the previous version, the notes are informative and mainstream for standard evangelical beliefs.

This  also happened when I tried to puncture the tiny hole at the top of the tube to get it started. Glue would always spurt out with barely any pressure on the tube. I  kept a bottle of nail polish remover handy. More frustrating was the fact that there was hardly any glue in those tubes. So much was wasted.

This gel sure makes a major difference. First, the directions for puncturing the top are that you twist the top until the clicking stops. I have no idea what is going on in there, but it sure beats trying to do it the other way. When I took the top off, no glue came out until I gently pressed the sides of the bottle as directed. GEL! So nice to be able to put a drop of glue where you want it, and not have it go where you don't!

7820,"Update: My first Caddy fell off my shower wall and broke after less than two months. After calling Oxo, Oxo sent a replacement and it has worked fine since then. I first gave this five stars, changed it to three after the first Caddy broke and have changed it back to five since the replacement works and Oxo sent a replacement at no cost. I did have to send e-mail photos showing the broken Caddy.

Here is my first review and then the update after the first one broke.

This really works well. I am using it in a tile shower and have three bottles on it plus some regular soap and a washcloth and it has held up for a couple of weeks and looks like it will continue to stay in place. It really helps because my tile shower has one built-in shelf that is way to small.

This is easy to install.  There is a handle in the center and all you do is position it in a corner and press the handle. When you do that, the sides expand until they come into contact with the  walls. The pressure and the non-slip pads on each side of the caddy do a great job of keeping this secure. I wanted my caddy to be a little higher after installing it and all I had to do was pull out the handle and then move it. No problem.

I actually called Oxo to see if there was a specific weight limit on this. If something is too heavy I would think this will fall. I could not get a specific answer. I have two bottles of shampoo about 13 ounces each and some liquid soap which is about 22 ounces plus a bar of soap and a washcloth on the caddy and it is holding fine.

There are holes in this so water will drain though rather than forming puddles on it. The bottles sit on it without a problem.

This is really great if you need another shelf in your shower. It works extremely well.

Update: I loved the caddy until I went to take a shower and saw it on my shower floor. It seems the pressure and nonstick pads were not enough to keep it in place and now that it fell it won't hold for more than an hour.",3,"[-2.187074597431012, -1.6923220378592019, -1.433886034069233, 0.8338420682597639, -0.6550558710082517]",0.8338420682597639

Honestly, the Egyptians may not have worn their eyes w/ liners, it's just the artists could of simply painted black lines under their eyes to keep the art simple. Meaning, it's not like in our modern art world, ancient folks didn't have easy access to paints, their's came from plant dyes or animals, or both. Also, some Mediterrean/Asian descent ppl have such luscious eyelashes, that they naturally look like they have eye liner on. So, in the art of the ancient Egyptians, lines could of been simply used to convey thick eyelashes, not daily make-up.

4 Stars- IF one remembers this is a HOLLYWOOD FICTIONAL VERSION OF EXODUS- then, like of Ridley's Gladiator - you will be entertained! I actual enjoyed it, despite the inaccuracies. It was WAAAAayy better than then Noah version w/ Russell Crowe, that was just a very strange movie. If the director would of called the movie ""Cain,"" I think it would been more accurate. I mean, in the Bible, we don't know what happens to Cain, he just wanders the Earth, so any story would be ok to conjure up.

As in, they're officially one of my all-time favorite couples in the world of M/M romance and that's saying something because that list is exclusive for those men who I was fully invested in and still obsess over. Ezra and Dae may be opposites in more ways than one but it's those differences that make them so darn perfect for each other. It's like one fills the gaps within the other, and in the end, they make one another whole, though it's clear that Ezra has more issues than Dae does based on Ezra's past relationship and his upbringing alone. But Ezra is also the one who makes Dae see that he is open to commitment...with the right man.

Now, there was some apprehension on my end when the whole Catholic angle was brought in. I'm a lifelong Catholic--albeit a liberal one--and while I can readily admit that the Church has an antiquated way of thinking on many touchy subjects, it's also been more progressive as of late, thanks to Pope Francis. So, I was wary about it being made into a scapegoat of sorts, but lo and behold, it wasn't. I should have had more faith in the authors because they took it in a pleasantly surprising direction. As an aside, the term ""pastor"" threw me off since it's one I've never heard used in Catholicism but Google informed me that it is used in the US for parish priests. Go figure.

Three books into this series and I still can't tell who between Christina Lee and Nyrae Dawn are writing which parts, and that's a testament to how seamlessly these two seem to work as a duo.

It is mainly the story of four amazing women, Yael, Revka, Aziza and Shirah, all from different areas originally but came to know one another as they became dovekeepers, on Masada, a mountain and fortress in the Judean desert, first fortified by Alexander Jannaeus in the first century BCE., then by others, and the place where the last Jewish stronghold against Roman invasion stood under the leadership of Eleazar ben Ya'ir  a Sicarii.  Together with a small group of followers, he made his way to the abandoned fortress of Masada where he continued his resistance to the Romans until 73 CE, The story which is divided into four parts, give us a look at the past and present history of these four women and how they ended up there escaping the Romans that had driven them out of Jerusalem and surrounding cities.

9408,"I burned out on Alvin and the Chipmunks somewhere back around 1958. This may seem hard to believe, but they had a number one hit song. I felt sick every time I heard it on the radio. I just haven't been able to listen to Chipmunk music or view them since that  time. I tell you this as a matter of disclosure so you may understand my review better.

My wife likes animated cartoons and we watch them now and then, too often as far as I'm concerned. A few weeks ago, she purchased an ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" DVD. Groan. Of course, we'd have to view it. Well, last night we viewed it. It was interesting in that the movie was filmed in a conventional fashion and then the animated chipmunks were added to the film as if they had been live at the scenes. It's a clever animation technique, without question. The animated Chipmunks therefore appeared to be interacting with the filmed characters. I suppose it must be difficult to get everything synchronized and in perfect order. The directors didn't. In a lot of places, the chipmunk characters were not in the focus of the actors and you could clearly see the actors were performing on their own. I could cite other glitches, but that would probably be considered too picky.

In any case, I suppose I noticed such things because I found the animation rather interesting, but didn't find the movie itself all that interesting. The human acting seemed stiff and unnatural and the actors interfaced with the animated characters only poorly. The story line was weak and uninteresting. Three singing Chipmunks get discovered and work their way to the top of the charts. Yawn. There weren't many substantial laughs unless you like slapstick. In short, the movie was a waste of viewing  time. However, the animated chipmunks themselves were rather well done, if not a little too cutsiepoo.

I'm really burned out on Chipmunk music, especially that Christmas thing. However, some of the new songs in up-to-date styles with dance routines were mildly amusing. That's about it, folks. View it at your own discretion, it's your dime. I can't comprehend how adults could watch this, but I think that small kids (under six) might find it enjoyable. Did I mention that I'm really burned out on Alvin and the Chipmunks?

7842,"This is my first 'pod' coffee brewer I've ever bought. We do have these at the office and the coffee there is disgusting as 'free' office coffee is supposed to be, to the point that if I ever 'have to' drink it, I always pick 'decaf' because I wouldn't waste any of my caffeine daily quote on... that. With that background, I've heard so many good things about the Keurig process, I couldn't resist ordering this one as a Black Friday special.

So far, I am not disappointed, or not yet. The machine was pretty easy to set up and it makes coffee quickly. As for the quality... I'm used to grind and brew my own so... no, it's not 'just as good', not even close but this should largely depend of the specific Keurig flavor used and I've only tried a couple so far. Definitely better than the horrors that our office machine brews though.

The specific pod coffee flavor aside, brewing a cup, once the machine is plugged in and the water reservoir is full is as easy opening up the top intake, dropping in a fresh pod, closing it up, selecting the 'size' and pushing the 'on' button. Coffee is ready in less than a minute. By the way, they have 5 sample pods in the box but those I've tried didn't impress me. Like I said, you can pick your favorite size (S, M, L) but there is not 'strength' selector. Sadly, there isn't enough room for me to stick any of my relatively tall travel mugs underneath so I must have this intermediate step where the coffee is first delivered into a shorter mug, then I pour it into my taller one.

So far so good but I will still brew my own coffee every time I feel like drinking 'good' coffee. I am still optimistic that I will eventually find some good flavor.

STOP using shiny, black plastic on consumer devices! Or at least improve it.

I barely touch this camera for this reason.

On the other hand, because of that, they can stand up to heavier spreads and toppings without breaking, and they're much less likely to be damaged during shipping.

The taste is mostly neutral although, due to the presence of sesame seeds, these are going to be better in combination with savory toppings.  I tried (separately) Monterey Jack cheese and natural peanut butter, and both of those worked.  Sodium levels are intermediate, I'd say, but these are not overly salty.  You can see the full ingredients list and Nutrition Facts panel if you look at the product images.

These are fairly high in fiber, healthy fats (from the seeds and oils), and protein, plus they have a little iron.  They're whole grain, vegan, non-GMO, and organic, if any of those are important to you.  Spelt is a variety of wheat, though, so these are not gluten free.  The spelt flour and seeds, together, give these a ""rustic"" feel, so if you're looking for something softer or more refined, this is probably not what you want.  Since I've been eating whole grains pretty much exclusively for several years now, though, these are a texture I'm used to.  They're not greasy and don't leave oils on your fingers, but they are a little messy.  When you break or bite into them, seeds tend to fall off, so you should definitely eat them over a plate.

I've been using these as part of the lunches I bring to work and I think they're great for that, since they're fairly healthful and since they're easily portable.

This is not the story of Hercules (Johnson) as it was originally told and after watching this I really didn't mind that so much.  Part of that reason was that the previous Legend of Hercules movie was so bad that the movie makers could only go up from there.

Johnson was a good choice as Hercules and certain played the role well, certainly much better than the actor in the Legend movie out this year.  In fact, I am surprised we haven't seen him in a Conan remake.  The supporting cast and his team of mercenaries are an eclectic set of characters and work well for the movie.

This is less of a fantasy movie focused on monsters and gods but more of a movie that portrays Hercules as a more realistic hero whose legend has developed by some fanciful story telling.  I really didn't mind that as it gave a sense of reality to the hero and I liked the way it was portrayed.  The battle scenes are immense and epic and very well done..there are so many extras (real and CG) that it really does give a sense of a huge battle.

One of the many things that fell flat with the previous Legend of Hercules movie was the spectacular failure of the cheap CG graphics.  This movies special effects was good and well done for the most part, although having just recently watched Malificient, the graphics were not quite up to that level but still good nonetheless.

This unit is easy to move around, and for storage, the handle, and hose come off. The extra hose ends have an easy on/off ring on the wand. You can change the type of pressure stream easily. The extra wand ends are stored on the handle.
I have found that when you remove the pressure hose, make sure that you let out the pressure with engine and water supply off, at the trigger. This makes it very easy to turn the hose connection off of the pump pipe. You can easily do it by hand.  I found out the hard way on my old unit, that by forcing the hose off of the pump connection, it is easy to strip the hose threads. This was a $125. lesson. I was also told by the repair guy that it is unwise to leave the power washer engine running without the water going through the wand for more than a very short time. The engine is cooled by the water going through it.
Incidentally...I ordered a pump manifold on Amazon for my old washer, put it on myself, and it now works as well. Parts are available for these units. I have been very happy with the quality of the Briggs. It has good pressure, always starts and it has been reliable.",3,"[-1.8293628978455378, -0.7670505654971251, -1.1030241372047256, 0.8239431362979154, -1.5545305885540568]",0.8239431362979154

7604,"This product went from high expectations while in the box to a  bit of disappointment in use.

The good parts:

1. The HA100 looks good. It's quite small - roughly 2 1/2"" x 2 1/4"" across and only maybe 3/4"" thick. The fit and finish are excellent showing a combination of the shiny high tech black common and a nice brushed finish for the top.

2. Operation is flawless. It showed up on several tested iPhones and iPads and paired quickly and easily. There was no issue getting a good signal to several output devices using both the 3.5 mm and RCA plugs (both supplied).

The not so good parts:

1. It has no internal battery. The factory supplied way to power it is to use the supplied 120 v power cord so you're tied to needing a outlet to use the HA100.

2. The power cord has, at its plug end, one of those incredibly annoying huge transformers which hog up a great deal of space at the outlet or power strip. This hog of a transformer is oriented ideally for a power strip and is thinner than others. Still, I'm sick and tired of this trend of having a huge block at the plug end of a power cord. I have some power strips where I lose half the outlets due to these transformers blocking more than their share of real estate. In this case, the HA100's transformer isn't a worse case than others but it's still something I want to never have to contend with again. Good luck with that.

To be fair to the HA100, it does say for home stereo use and home stereos do demand power so this limitation is, perhaps, asking it to do things that it wasn't advertised to do. If you have a matching 12 v power supply such as available here at Amazon, you could also use it in your car, but it'd mean a rather complex mass of cabling, but it should work (not tested).

Still, there are many portable devices which have 3.5mm or RCA inputs and it'd have been quite nice to have the HA100 provide the Bluetooth / NFC link to these devices but alas, it's not to be. Also that *#&*#& enormous transformer at the plug end of the power cord. I'm so tired of this that I almost want to remove a star due to that, but I won't.",3,"[-2.031846817372123, -1.7405226355110754, -0.9325154301793627, 0.8238128950029132, -0.8103319592854826]",0.8238128950029132

The premise -- creatively, I mean -- couldn't be beat:  exploring the Star Wars universe by means of digital cartoons!  What promise!  This frees the creators from having to depend on the aging (and mortal) faces and voices of actors like Mark Hamill and Alec Guiness.  They had at their disposal the means of churning out an endless series of movies freed of many of the fetters that so famously plagued George Lucas in 1976-7.

Unfortunately, when it came time to select the theme for this inaugural outing somebody saw fit to choose the well worn ""Hey, girls can too!""

Argghghghhgh.  Several problems with this:

1.  It's already been done!  Think about Leia as the spunky princess in Episode IV!
2.  Admittedly, there might be a certain percentage of Star Wars buffs that are interested in such a theme, but they're certainly a negligible minority:  most Star Wars nuts are guys and, owing to the violence and science-fictiony aspects of the genre, always will be!  It doesn't matter how many Gloria Gaynors you cram into these films, you're simply not going to make little girls interested in them, and more than you're going to make little boys interested in playing with Barbies merely because you give her a Jeep to drive!

Even then, it was still powdery and if you tried to breath, you'd choke from the intake.

I would suggest spraying the popcorn with a mist of olive oil or butter spray - then toss with this stuff.  That might help lend some flavor.  As for us - we're going back to the dry ranch dressing  mix and melted sharp cheese.

I switched to sheets from rolls a few years ago when Costo switched to a substandard supplier, and have been well pleased--I was always cutting the sheets the wrong size, or tearing a corner, or struggling while they rolled up on me. My go-to sheets are these commercial ones (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C7KU4V6)--cheap, flat (not folded), and excellent even in long roast a very hot oven or a moderate trip under the broiler. But some people might not have a kitchen with enough storage space for the giant box of 1000 (size of a half sheet pan, but 5"" thick), or may not need parchment enough to ever use 1000 (I use them a LOT and still have almost half a box 2 years in). In that case, I'd highly recommend these over rolls.

While not as convenient anf foolproof as flat pack, the folded sheets don't fight you too much, and the nonstick quality may be even a hair better than my commercial sheets. The box is tiny, only 1/4 the size of a half sheet pan and less than an inch thick, very easy to find a home for. And iy you use a quaryer sheet pan (toaster oven size) a lot, the folds are actually nice, because they make the sheets easy to tear in half.

This new Scotch laminator solves all those issues and adds features. For one - it's about half the size of the previous model. It LITERALLY is ready in one minute. ONE minute! It takes the same amount of time to laminate a sheet (about 40 seconds), and cools down MUCH faster than the previous model.  I literally plugged it in, and within 3 minutes, had laminated something and put it away.

It's got a carrying handle built in which is actually more convenient than I would've thought. This was a well thought out design.

* removable tip makes clean-up a snap (just be sure to remove the tape holding the tip to the main part of the baster because it's not easy to see the tape -- yeah, I tried to remove the tip before noticing the tape);

7698,"I drink a lot of tea at work and I was running out.  Plus, I'm fickle and like to try different kinds of tea without committing to buy dozens of bags of the same kind.  So this was an easy decision.

These are caffeinated, which is precisely what I wanted.  I start out most mornings with tea (not being a coffee person).  Each is individually-wrapped in an easy-to-open foil packet.

My favorite is probably the strawberry; for some reason, I don't think I've had strawberry tea before, but the blend of flavors works quite well.  The jasmine green tea and mint green tea are also nice.  I regularly forget to remove my tea bags and the green teas don't get too bitter.  I'm glad for the inclusions of some ""plainer"" or unflavored selections such as Darjeeling for those times when I just want straight black tea.  I actually think the mix is quite nice -- there's something for everyone, and these would be good to offer at an event for that very reason.

Please note that although fruit pieces are sometimes included, many of the packages list ""flavors"" before the fruit pieces in the ingredients lists.  I am all right with this, because I know that steeping, say, plain old dried strawberries would not result in a very flavorful tea.  And there are no food dyes, which is great.

This is pretty basic tea.  It's inexpensive, it doesn't come in fancy pyramid bags, etc.  It's not going to compete with Mighty Leaf or Numi or any of those sorts of brands.  However, for someone on a budget who doesn't mind the artificial flavors, this is a great choice.",3,"[-2.5697329095081334, -1.01857742886201, -0.8854995189414112, 0.8113661576886354, -0.8004349193365068]",0.8113661576886354

9718,"I bought this from my vet's office after a recent vet visit.  My old(ish), cranky, chronically ill cat was obsessed with the diffuser they had in their exam room.  Plus, I had heard it was supposed to make cats mellower in a multi-cat household.  Since I do have one cat with lower urinary tract disease, which is aggravated by stress, I figured this would be good to try.

So far, I'm quite happy with it.  The diffuser is much nicer than the cheapie Airwick diffusers for home fragrance.  While I can't smell the Feliway product (it's cat pheromones, after all), I do notice a steady decrease in the liquid level over time.  Because you can't smell it, you do have to remember to check the level periodically.  It's clear liquid and doesn't leave any stains or marks on anything as it diffuses.

I think this is having an effect on my cats, too.  They seem to want to spend a lot of time in the bedroom these days (where I have this plugged in).  I do think they're calmer, as well -- my black cat seems more affectionate and less skittish.  I'll be honest, I've had the same group of cats for a couple of years now, so they're a bit older (the youngest is 6, the oldest 10) and used to each other.  None of them was a terrible problem to begin with, and I never had any urine marking issues.  So I wouldn't expect to see a huge turnaround in behavior.  (However, if I ever get another cat, I'll update this review with Feliway's role in my integration experience.)

To say that this, Kind Of Blue, by the man, the one and only Miles Davis is the perfect Jazz album is well a complete understatement. Kind Of Blue is THE Jazz album. To be able to put together a album so good could have only been done under the order of the great ""king of cool"" Miles. But he didn't do it alone, oh no far too easy for a man of his stature. He called upon such heavy hitters as the amazing John Coltrane to blow some sax, which is always a wise choice as he is the best. But not just Coltrane alone he also called upon ""Cannonball Julian Adderley. The great Bill Evans on piano. Jimm Cobb and Paul Chambers on drums and bass. Talk about an all star line-up. What these musicians came together to do was create the greatest jazz album of all time, and the coolest jazz album of all time, and that they did.

To sit and nit pick the album in it's completeness would be too hard. With a album full of nothing but good tracks you can't find any stand outs or any weak links. The textures of each song and the mood of all the songs bring together one of the best feelings of satisfaction at the end of the record.

'Blue In Green' being a personal favorite of my own, a true classic in Mr. Davis' musical cannon. 'All Blues' is a real classic among classics. Here you have everyone in the group especially Miles at the top of their game. The alternate version of 'Flamenco Sketches' is in my opinion superior, but thats not to say that the other is of lesser quality, quite the opposite in-fact it is fantastic. 'Freddie Freeloader' is a nice piano driven song which just an all around good feel. And as the album opens with the upbeat 'So What' which couldn't have opened the album any better then it did, it asures that this album is a sure win for any listener.

So to realease my final verdict on this album, well if you can't tell I think it is absolutly amazing. Quite simply the best album in the genra of Jazz. To any one who is even curious I do recomend this to all.",3,"[-1.1306745826236724, -2.175039565617245, -1.0085201691878873, 0.8084331140430598, -0.45231832285500595]",0.8084331140430598

She now can venture that perhaps John was a Gnostic Gospel while so-called Gnostic works should be seen as more in line with traditional documents.
The author sets out on a task that has eluded many others: The discovery of the origins of Christianity, those first years when it was still a small sect of mainly Jews whose beliefs were totally at odds with those of later generations.  And what she found was surprising - this apparently orthodox religion was never pure nor simple not were its followers in agreement on beliefs.  Instead, the movement emerged from theological and cultural conflicts and the Jesus we now know is the outcome of that battle.
Her vehicles for time travel are the newly discovered Gospel of Thomas and the John, the fourth Gospel. The reason we have four and not five or six or seven Gospels is due to the battles of theology and history.  To the victors go the spoils. She points out that John itself veers radically away from the Synoptics.
Jesus becomes God, the Creator of the Universe, his  humanity only a veneer for divinity.  Jesus the man was of no importance except for fulfilling Old Testament prophecy.

The reason for the 4 stars is that the bottle has many lines and patterns which make it difficult to tell the level of the sugar water. It's hard to know when it needs filling. We have always had a problem with wasps around the feeder. They seem to congregate at the underside of the feeder and sometimes even chase the birds away. I have two feeders, the old one is a Homestead brand, all plastic, yellow ""flowers"" and red base and the one I am reviewing, the Perky-Pet.(what a weird name)Apparently the Homestead either leaks slightly or the act of the birds getting the sugar water allows sugar water to seep around the unit collecting at the bottom. This is what draws the wasps. So far over the last two weeks this has not been a problem with the Perky-Pet.

9792,"The NUTRO MAX Grain Free Dog Food was happily chowed down by my brother's Beagle Scout.  As he gets older, Beagle Scout has been having issues eating foods with grain in them, so bro has been trying out various grain free dog foods.  Now either Beagle Scout loves his carbs, or he's missing out on flavor country, but there are few grain free dog foods he likes.  The Nutro Max Chicken recipe was well received by him, but not with great gusto - that said, he ate it but didn't seem thrilled by it.

The kibble is fairly smally, and suitable for most small and medium sized breed dogs.  Mr. 30 lb beagle was able to chew the kibble easily, and didn't seem to have issues eating it plain.  Each kibble about the size and shape of a pea - I'm guessing most dogs can easily eat this. This is not a kibble that crumbles or breaks terribly easily. He did enjoy eating this kibble mixed with some canned food. As always, you may want to see if you can get your hands on a small sample size before committing to a large bag.

In terms of ingredients, this kibble isn't the best I've seen, but it's still okay. The first ten ingredients are chicken meal, dried potatoes, chickpeas, chicken fat (preserved with mixed Tocopherols), peas, lamb meal, chicken, potato starch, dried plain beet pulp, and dehydrated alfalfa meal. I'm not particularly thrilled about the amounts of by-products in this food, but in comparison to some other dog foods I've seen, this food still has a lot less unnecessary fillers. The remaining ingredients go into various minerals, vitamins, vegetables, fruits, and extracts. There are a TON of mineral and vitamins listed...whether or not these are good for your pooch is questionable. That said, again in comparison to other dog foods I've seen, this isn't too bad.

Overall, this isn't a bad kibble to feed your dog. It isn't full of fillers, it didn't upset Beagle Scout's stomach, and most importantly - he eats it. Like all food items, taste is highly subjective, so if you can get a sample for your pampered pooch, definitely let your dog try it out first.",3,"[-1.785648121541801, -0.6423380767610011, -0.8790494612713053, 0.8066377538324322, -1.2366968783254453]",0.8066377538324322

9789,"This feeder seems to work as advertised but not without some problems. In this review, I'm going to go through the problems I have encountered and let you decide for yourself if this is the right product for you.

Firstly, the feeder can tip over and spill all the food easily when it is fully elevated. It is just not stable enough with the legs fully extended and the load of kibbles on top. It has already caused me a messy cleanup and now I wouldn't extend it beyond the mid-height. Secondly, the legs aren't easy to fold back as they seem. There are clips at the bottom of the feeder to catch the legs as they are folded back. However, they don't seem to line up correctly on my feeder and are often times in the way as the legs are being folded onto them. I have to turn the feeder upside down and wiggle the legs to line up with the clips. Otherwise, the clips would get slammed and may eventually break.

The feeder bowl seems to work well though. It does a good job of lengthening a meal due to the partitioning ridges and valleys in the bowl that slow down the feeding and in turn help reduce bloats and gas. It is also removable for cleaning and is dishwasher safe (top rack).

Overall, a good concept but rather poor execution. While the removable feeder bowl works great, the adjustable legs just aren't sturdy and stable enough. I wish the legs are sturdier and the clips are done better. If you have a problem with your dog eating too fast, you may give it a try. Just be forewarned that it can tip over easily when elevated.",3,"[-1.8138078467594467, -1.2475860569647856, -0.3270638329736526, 0.8024387256379847, -1.372582762710573]",0.8024387256379847

7658,"Some time ago, I purchased some mints in a little round box. I used them as breath fresheners and they worked quite well. As I was going through the usage, my three-year-old son developed a mild cold with a cough. I was out of cough drops so when he was coughing, I gave him a breath mint for soothing. That seemed to solve the problem just as well as a cough drop. Well, his cold is long gone but it seems as if he's developed a little fake cough in order to get another breath mint. Kids can be so funny! In any case, I finally ran out so I picked up a couple more little boxes of Ice Breakers in the wintergreen and coolmint flavors. They're sugar free, which probably suits both of us well. They're quite good mints for my purposes and they seem to overcome his little cough too.

5822,"""Belief is a noun. Believe is a verb.""  For me this quote sums up Bryant Cornett's commentary on the gospel of Jesus Christ, the title is taken from Peter's denial after the arrest of Jesus, right before the Crucifixion. This book is like no other I have read: on my Kindle it is interactive; which means whatever I am reading is linked to a scripture reference that I can click on to go more in-depth. Having read and studied the Bible for years, this was informative, and fun, trying to guess what scripture he would quote--many times he would give me something new to think about. For any level of seeker this can be enlightening. The author wrote the book based on a Sunday school lesson that he gave and recorded. It can also be downloaded and heard with a link he gives in the book. At the beginning of each chapter, and before you start the lesson; he gives you gospel chapters to read. This is a superb tool for anyone learning about Jesus and The Bible. For new believers or seasoned followers it deepens your walk with God. Another one of my favorite quotes is: ""But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.""

I loved the original version of Return of the Jedi and the Special Edition takes the darkness mytery out of the Jabber the Hut scene. I mean the scene with creatures perforrning there is now turned into annoying cgi musical number. It's just goofy and doesn't belong in a scene that is meant to be dark and mysterious.  Well Lucas obviously didn't think it was meant to stay that way. The new score at the end of the Return of the Jedi as well, I think is really bad and I miss the original score. Lucas is too much into effects and todays technology. Mean look at the prequels, if he put more time into the scripts and less into the visuals, the movies might compare with the original movies. Anyway I think the original movies were fine before the special editions. Ok the Jabber the hut and Han Solo scene that was added to the original in entertaning. Some other changes like the ones to Return of the Jedi are really bad though. I heard rumors that Lucas actually wants to make Special Special Editions now but I think he hacked his beloved trilogy to bits enough. I'm still gonna buy these dvd's, don't get me wrong but the original versions should be there as well.

That means you cannot lose the user guide! Thankfully LifeTrak has made user and information guides available on their web site.

Following the user guide, it is easy to adjust the settings: time, date etc and your age, weight etc. The strap is comfortable to wear.

To check your pulse, you press the VIEW button for about 7 seconds and it shows your pulse rate. Then there is the START button to start and stop your workout. Third button is the MODE button for different settings.

I think the pulse rate was fairly accurate. To connect to Bluetooth app, you have to use Argus app and Move C300 connected easily to the Argus app on my iPhone. But seeing your workout and heart rate etc. on Argus app is not easy, because that app is setup to track numerous health related stuff like diet, coffee, water intake, food intake, sleep and so on. Finding your pulse rate and steps and activity in all that clutter is not easy! I wish they established connection with Healthvault account so you can keep track of it over time, on the web and iPhone.

One of the biggest advantage of Move C300 is the built in battery, so you do not require frequent charging. Although description says "" Sync data to some of your favorite health and fitness apps"", as of now it syncs only with Argus app.

Wrapping my mind around a gay Jewish conservative was quite a feat. He prides himself on being outrageous and making you uncomfortable at times with his statements. But beneath all of the bluster, there are some serious ideas he discusses.
His best argument is the caving of American universities to his appearances. The left pounds diversity and freedom of speech unless they don't like your speech such is the case with Milo. Then they call it hate speech and throw fits and destroy stuff until the university caves.
I remember being in college and seeing a man standing on campus spouting some bizarre ultra right wing Jesus talk when I was in school. I hadnt thought about it until reading this book. I stood there and listened to this man go on and on about hell and sin and also remember some students arguing with him as well. I remember moving on after a few minutes because I didn't believe in what he was saying but he was there exercising is right to say what he wanted.

9666,"NOTE: This pressure washer failed after two years.

This pressure washer is as effective for many jobs as my 3500 PSI gas-powered Karcher unit. It is also much lighter and easier to use. One of the reasons for that is actually the lower PSI. When washing a surface where you have hold the stream close to the surface, the 3500 PSI unit is much more difficult to hold in place than this 1900 PSI washer. The AR Blue Clean comes with a selection of nozzles, my preference was the green one, which gives you a tight stream in a fan shape. It has a roll up caddy for the hose, and a place to roll up the electrical cord. Set up was easy and sensible. Even if you've never used a pressure washer before, you'll figure it out easily. So what are my concerns?

1. Lots of plastic in the construction. So handle it with care.
2. The threaded connection for the adapter that your hose screws into is plastic, so there is a possibility of wear here over time.
3. The wheels are too small, and they are plastic. Larger, rubber wheels would make this much easier to roll around. However, it is also light enough that you can just carry it and not worry about rolling it.

I don't think this unit has the construction or features to hold up under heavy use. However, if you want it for some around the home cleaning three or four times per year, it should last for many years. In about a three hour session I cleaned a medium sized storage shed, my grill, a five piece patio set, a three piece patio set, and about 40% of my pool deck. Due to the lighter load on my arms from the lesser PSI, I wasn't nearly as tired after three hours of using this unit as I would have been after wrangling the Karcher for that long.

A positive note is that with 1900 PSI you are not in danger of injury if you accidentally spray yourself with this stream. I literally took skin off a toe one time with the Karcher in an incautious moment. In fact, rinsing off my arms and legs with this stream actually felt quite pleasant ... but if you try this DO make sure that the nozzle is several inches away, or your could still get quite a sting.

I love that there are no other ingredients.  (They're also produced in a nut free facility, so these should be safe for people with allergies.)  They have a fair amount of fiber (perfect for a small snack), and while there is a little sugar, it's just natural sugar from the apples.

It's currently 89.96 at Walmart plus you have to pay sale taxes.

The picture and audio quality is simply outstanding.  I don't even have an enhanced auto system and the sound is still amazing.  On my LG HD TV, the picture is so crisp, sharp and vivid that it seems like I could reach out and touch the actors and the scenery. Each movie contains 5 disc: 2 for the extended version of the movie and 3 of the appendices.  Each movies contains approximately 30 to 60 minutes of additional scenes.  The extra footage adds additional information from the book, ""has real story value"" ( to use PJ's words during the commentary from the Hobbit: AUJ) and adds additional depth to the story/movie, as well as adding to the experience of watching such an amazing Saga that anyone fan, whether ""die hard"" or not will find this product exciting and well worth owning.

I highly recommend this particular version and format to anyone seeking to experience a breath taking visual and audio version of this remarkable fantasy saga with pertinent additional movie footage.",3,"[0.08074518160990318, 0.23576305234030226, -0.7897873405831147, 0.7929042482795842, -1.0096197182706024]",0.7929042482795842

9773,"Cutting and trimming hair requires sharp shears with precision snips.  When working on a pet (or child and even adult) the last thing you want is for the pet to move and you accidentally snip their skin or poke them.  The pointed tips of salon sheers will poke a person or, worse case, actually snip skin because they are that sharp.  These are just as sharp and the rounded tips allow pet faces and ears to be trimmed  with less chance of accidents.

The next thing you want to look for is a pair of shears that actually cuts the hair and does NOT push the hair through the blades.  Anyone that has used a regular pair of scissors, picks up a lock of hair and cuts can tell you that the hair does not cut clean - it slides along the substandard blades and ends with a choppy cut.  This is the same with pet hair. The last thing you want is to have to keep snipping on a moving pet - once and done, that's the best.  I can say with confidence that these shears are sharp enough that when you're ready to make the cut, they will cut clean and with accuracy.

 I've been cutting human hair for over 25 years and I had my doubts about the precision of these blades.
I must say, however, they have the same quality as salon shears.  I trimmed both of our pets yesterday - they had just been professionally groomed and they still had a few longer pieces around their face.  I used the short shears to trim and just a snip cleaned up those stray hairs left by the groomer.  Then I noticed a few longer hairs on my father's ears.  I used these shears to do that too and he said --- you know, with these rounded tips, I can trim any nose hairs too.  I guess whatever trips your trigger.

A note of care - don't use any hair or pet shears for paper, not even once!  If you run a piece of paper, snip off a clothing tag, etc -- you have just started to ruin your blades.  Hair is so fine that you need to dedicate these shears to that purpose.
In the end - they're well worth the money.  They're sharp, precise and safer than using a regular pair of scissors to trim up the pets.",3,"[-1.7804914087213013, -1.0579755008861098, -1.0955588361768958, 0.78997790849822, -0.6707746675978666]",0.78997790849822

I really love the glass teapot and infuser, it is just the right size, and this gift set is great because it comes with a cannister of twelve flowering teas (with many varied flowers!), so you can use it the minute you open the box!

I gave this set a five star rating mostly based on the teapot itself, and on the entire blooming tea experience. For my tastes, I must warn you that the Primula Jasmine green tea that comes with the set has very little, if any, jasmine flavor. I am used to using a good quality jasmine pearl green tea (such as Rishi, but there are many other brands which you can also purchase here on Amazon in the grocery department), so I enjoy a healthy amount of jasmine flavor in my tea.

I am not saying that the green tea that comes with this set is poor quality, just that it is extremely weak in jasmine flavor. In truth, I couldn't even detect it at all. So the experience of the tea for me is closer to just drinking a decent quality Chinese green tea, without any flavor enhancers. If I was rating the jasmine tea that comes with the set, I would only give the tea three stars, by itself. I am going to shop around and perhaps try some of the other blooming tea brands to see if I can find one that more closely matches my own taste.

Each mold holds 4oz of liquid.  If you are not sure about your blender, fill it up with 24oz of water (volume = 1 and 1/2 bottles of 16oz water bottle).  Empty the blender and fill it with solids and liquid before blending to the same level.  This way you will not overfill or underfill the molds.  The advice is to leave 1/2 inch not filled at the top of the mold.  Abide it because it will prevent overflow once the content is frozen.  Put molds upright on tray to pour.  When you pour, pour with care (no shakey hands).  I spill outside of the molds a few times.  All it takes is to dip the frozen treat into hot water a few seconds for easy unsheathing.  This is the easiest and healthiest way to give yourself and your family a good summer treat without breaking the bank and with years of good use.  The possibilities are limitless!

I add about 2 table spoons of ground raw black sesame into the mixture.  You can't taste it, only seeing the black flakes.  Black sesame can slow facial aging and delay graying of dark colored hair.  Use coffee bean grinder to grind it and store in a glass jar.

My first stop was the site of a Korean woman (Hi Hi) who shared this fabulous chocolate chip cookie recipe - topped with this salt

Chocolate Chip Cookies

2 1/2 cups packed light brown sugar
1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
2 large eggs
2 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground cinnamon
2 cups chocolate chips

1 tablespoon pink Himalayan sea salt

Preheat oven to 375.

In a mixing bowl, beat the brown sugar and butter together at medium speed until fluffy. Add the eggs and beat until combined. In a bowl, stir together the flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon, then add to the butter mixture and combine. Stir in the chips by hand.

Drop the dough onto the prepared baking sheets by rounded 1-inch balls, leaving 1 inch between them. Sprinkle a pinch of sea salt on top of each ball of dough.

Another recipe I found involved using watermelon cubes - simply cube your watermelon then sprinkle lightly over the top OR have some of the salt on the side to add to the combination of sweet and sour.

Of course, the BEST choice is to make a deep cappuccino fudge, sprinkling the salt lightly over the top for that instant salty/chocolate/sweet taste. Oh Yeah!

Of course, you can use this anywhere that you can use ""ordinary"" salt - although the fine grain makes it saltier by volume than standard table salt, so be cautious. It is that very ""extra salty"" flavor that makes it so perfect for the combination of sweet and salty.

Not just recommended - highly recommended - with chocolate, of course.",3,"[-2.020312025151231, 0.6530047446855325, -1.2206924393086933, 0.7839510537741389, -0.9309573593374534]",0.7839510537741389

7327,"Nearly every successful artist has recorded a Christmas album, but few can stand up to Celine Dion's ""These Are Special Times"". Filled with beautifully-performed tracks, this record will be forever remembered as a timeless classic.
Opening up with the cathartic hymn, 'O Holy Night', Dion uses her strong vocal chords to send the sacred piece into the heavens, then gently brings it back to earth. 'Ave Maria' is beautifully enhanced by her tender vocals, adding an unusual touch to this Christmas compilation.
What makes this album different from all of the other Christmas records out there is its diversity in music. Everyone can sing 'Joy to the World'. Celine brings listeners something different, uniting both sacred and secular tracks in one seamless arrangement. New songs 'Christmas Eve' and 'Another Year Has Gone By' stand proudly aside classics such as 'Feliz Navidad' and, my personal favorite, 'Happy XMas (War is Over)'.
If you're looking for a great Christmas album that truly captures the tenderness and joy of the holidays, look no further.

After reading the description for this product, it seemed to be ideal for use with a laptop computer. Since it doesn't come with an AC cord, I was afraid that it wouldn't be adequate for the devices that I intended to use it for. I was wrong.

After removing it from the box, I simply detached one of the devices that was plugged into the back of my Mac and plugged this unit in. I than plugged the device I had removed into this unit, along with 3 other devices that use a USB port. To my surprise, everything works perfectly, even when many devices are being used at the same time. I'm able to use my printer, my keyboard, my back-up hard drive, my Kindle, my iPad, my iPad Touch, etc., all with no loss in signal strength whatsoever. This tiny little USB hub sits behind my computer and just dangles from one of the USB ports. The cable is very short, but due to it's extremely light weight, there's no problem with it becoming detached.

The only thing I don't care for on the hub, is the red light that constantly shines. This is a personal issue and has nothing to do with the quality of the hub. I'm just one of those people who doesn't care for red lights. If it came with a blue light, I'd be happier. Obviously, this is not a big deal, and has no effect on the wonderful performance of the hub.

The bottom line is that this hub works better than I had expected. It completely solved my problem of not having enough USB ports. It did so in such an unobtrusive way, that I hardly notice that the unit is even there.

My first ceramic pans were WMF skillets that I purchased at a great price at another site.

The WMF pans have no rivets inside and their ceramic coating is a deep gray.
Treated properly, they are wonderful to cook in, especially for things that normally stick in a stainless steel skillet.
They're my go to skillets for fried potatoes, omelets and any type of coated fish or chicken.

I never use metal utensils in mine and even when they are used to fry hamburgers, a quick soak and soapy sponge make it easy to clean them.
I've owned and used the WMF skillets for at least a year now and they still function flawlessly.

My hope is that this skillet will perform well long term too.
The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I'm not a fan of the white cooking surface.
During the gardening season, I prepare a lot of dishes with tomatoes and really hope it doesn't stain this skillet.

No other country in the world was founded on the same principles of America at its origin.  Rather than group identification such as the separation of aristocrats and peasants, our country was founded on the principle that we were all made in the image of G-d and had individual rights, not group rights.  Medved is right.

I am not sure about any ""miracles"" in our history, but we are certainly a miracle in human history by thinking that individual rights matter more than state rights.

Here are the specs and features:

- 3 line protection
- right-angle plug
- 15-Amp circuit breaker
- 120V 60Hz
- Noise filtering 40-45dB
- Joule rating 1300
- UL 1449 Rating/Clamping Level 330
- 6 ft. chord
- Illuminated on/off switch
- LED surge indicator
- Up to 8 outlets

The warranty paper claims 'lifetime' for the item itself and up to $50,000  on connected equipment for 5 years.

The lifetime in 'lifetime warranty' promise is not the purchaser's life but the life of the product itself. To quote from the Fellowes warranty document, ""the lifetime of the product is considered to be the time until the product naturally ceases to provide surge protection"". In other words, there is a warranty on the product for as long as it works. To quote again, ""when the LED fails to light, the product has performed its duty"" and the lifetime warranty is no longer in effect.

As for the $50,000 connected equipment warranty, the paper enumerates 10 instances under which the warranty becomes null and void including ""4. Fellowes determines that the equipment was not damaged by an Event or that no Event took place. 5. Fellowes determines that the Surge Protector was not properly installed, was tampered with, or was altered in any way.""

They have the same amount of calories as Welch's lower-sugar fruit snacks.  However if you read the ingredients and labels a bit more, you'll find that Yummy Earth's fruit snacks are indeed organic, with NO artificial colors or flavors.  Their ingredient listing is easy to read and includes things like organic sugar, brown rice syrup, and organic juice concentrates from carrots, apples, pumpkins, radishes and black currants.  It's almost like they walked through the organic produce section and said 'how can we make these healthy?' Yummy Earth found an easy way to make fruit snacks without using mystery ingredients such as Red 40, Yellow 5 and Blue 1 (research the effects of artificial colors and you'll open up a whole new can of worms, some of these are really bad for you).

That being said - it all comes down to taste, especially if you're buying these for a child.  My 5 year old has asked for these every day since we got them, and even knowing that we had other gummy snacks in the pantry (you know, the brand-name ones with cartoon faces that you can't really identify other than on the box).  These do taste good, fruity and yummy although not quite as sugary sweet as the other brands, since they use brown rice syrup rather than corn syrup (yet another can of worms).

The other little hitch is that these snacks do cost a bit more - compared to some other brands they cost quite a bit more.  So you have to weigh your priorities here - cost versus good for you.

Its not a given that the protein in a dogs food must be entirely meat based, nor are grains necessarily a terrible choice for all dogs.

I also personally know some dogs, though, who seem to do very well on Pro Plan.

My dog had no problems with Pro Plan, although I had to feed more to get the same amount of nutrition, which is not a good thing for my old, sedentary dog (or my clean-up duties).

7455,"Once again, the user reviews are the way to go.  These Belkin power strips (I hate to call them surge protectors, since they really only protect against normal household power problems), are highly rated for good reason.

The spacing of the outlets is well designed.  You never know what type of random-shaped wall-wart you'll get with a device, so you always wind up skipping over power ports.  But then again, running 12 items into a single outlet is probably not a good idea, even on a 20amp breaker.  You may not be able to use all 8 plugs, but the outlet spacing will make sure you can maximize what you have.  I have one with 6 different shaped wall-warts plugged into the more spaced out outlets, and I think that's a lot to ask of a power strip.

Outside of that, the sliding plug covers are always appreciated.  I like to close/cover the outlets I don't use.  I know dust normally isn't conductive, but I just like it for the safety.

One ""warning"" of sorts.  The power cords are big and heavy.  This is a good thing, but be prepared.  I wasn't watching when I ordered mine, and got a 12' power cord version, which I totally did not need.  Not a complaint in any way, and I know it's completely my fault for not paying attention.

for hot spots. But, I'll share a few things, and update when we've tried it longer.
(Note that we received a bottle with a different design. Hope ours was the new one
and not the old one!)

First off, this has a photo of both a cat and dog on the label. So, you could assume that
this is for both types of pets. I am not entirely sure of that now.
When I saw the word ""spray"", I had assumed it would be a mist that would easily
cover an area on an animal. It isn't. It is a sloppy wet spray that drips easily.
It took a long time to dry off of a comforter that we had placed the cat on to spray him.
(He has a hot spot he keeps going after, even tho he is worm/flea free.)

Secondly, this has propylene glycol in it. I am NOT happy about that. That is an ingredient
often used in making anti-freeze and other car fluids. It isn't something I wanted to see
in my pets' products.

This might work well for dogs who do not normally lick themselves a lot, esp on their backs.
For our cat, this is going to be tricky. We didn't restrain our cat, since I thought it was
just hydrocortisone and aloe. But, we later found out that it was much more.
Not sure what kind of damage that this might do when cats lick for grooming, and will ingest
much more of the product than a dog would. It would be possible to put some sort of collar on
our cat, I suppose, but I didn't want to do that.

So, not happy with the product at all at this point.

7641,"When I heard ""ranch dressing"" and ""popcorn"", I was pretty excited.  If I have the craving for Ranch Popcorn, I usually have to make my own using ranch dressing powder and herbs - this would allow for convenient ""open and shake!"" goodness!  Sadly, this ranch seasoning, while okay, really falls short in the flavor department.  To really season a big bowl of popcorn, it suggests a full capful of seasoning per bowl.  That's almost a tablespoon and a half of seasoning (1/4 teaspoon is a serving size) per bowl!  For health reasons alone, I simply shook some seasoning over my unbuttered airpopped popcorn.  The flavor wasn't particularly strong...in fact, the most pronounced taste I tasted was salt and maybe a little onion.  I tried again with buttered airpopped popcorn and the kernels with butter on them soaked up the flavor the best and tasted fairly good, although again very salty.

While it didn't wow anyone in my family on popcorn, the kids really enjoyed this over vegetables, particularly steamed broccoli.  They liked how there was a little seasoning without having to pour on a lot of ranch dressing.  This seasoning also worked well over baked potato french fries for the subtle ranch flavor - although the husband still ended up dipping them in ranch dressing afterwards.

Overall, given all the added preservatives and sodium, I would rather either stick to ranch dressing or making my own ranch style seasoning.  There's a lot of recipes online that have a lot more herbs, a lot less salt, and a whole lot more flavor than this.",3,"[-0.5446348044547467, 0.13458824820392978, -0.9365981899708707, 0.7497260169095886, -1.1708033441053647]",0.7497260169095886

The directions give info on how to fill the pops, place them in the mold and how to remove them from the tray. They are easy to clean in the dishwasher or by hand. The stand is convenient for holding the ice pops. The ice pops went over very well with my granddaughter.

I use two recipes, the first I found in Huffington Post:

Ice pops: These offer more thirst-quenching appeal. Combine fruit and juice to make ice pops. Simply blend together 1 cup of 100 percent juice (try mixing varieties, such as pineapple, orange, and cranberry) with 1 cup of fruit chunks (say, peaches, mango, or strawberries). Pour into pop molds and freeze for four hours. The fruit and juices provide re-energizing carbohydrates, potassium, and an array of antioxidants. Best of all? There's no added sugar in these homemade pops, so they contain fewer calories.

The next recipe came from allrecipes, and contain yogurt.

For frozen fruit and yogurt popsicles
4 (8-oz) containers of yogurt
1 (12-oz) bag frozen mixed berries
2 tablespoons honey
Make frozen fruit and yogurt popsicles
In a blender, whizz the yogurt, berries, and honey until smooth. Pour into the popsicle molds. Press on the lids and transfer to the freezer overnight
This might make more than is needed for the 6 ice pop molds, so you may need to adjust your ingredients.

These ice pop molds are such a great idea. The ice pops you purchase in the grocery store are all sugar. Now,you know what your child is getting. This product was provided for use and review.
