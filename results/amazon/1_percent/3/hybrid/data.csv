It features a slim design so it can fit in tight places. It lasts about four hours per charge and doesn't dim very much as the charge goes down.  Which leads me to the two things I dislike about it.  One, the unit I received for review flickers quite a lot, and it's VERY noticeable when working on objects near the light.  It tends to stop flickering near the end of the charge..  It's annoying, but it's possible I simply got a defective unit.  Second, there is no warning that I can detect when the charge gets low. The unit just turns off completely until you recharge it.  A pre-warning flashing red LED on the unit would be a big help to anticipate its impending shutoff.

I mean, despite what the blurb suggests, it doesn't even have a main character. What do you do with a book that doesn't have a main character or couple? What do you do? (As an aside, that blurb is totally inaccurate anyway.) There's no plot. The characters do everything from pine for one another to assassinations to buy a horse that randomly gets bitten by a snake. There's insta-lust and a relationship that goes from 0 to 4,000 in about a page. There is endless agonizing over if the characters are a couple yet and if they're gay or not, all in artificial and exaggerated ways. There's pointless past trauma that is too much to be believed.

There is telling, telling, telling about how wonderful and significant and 'I'll be with you forever even though we've been a couple for 2 days' the characters feel, all adding up to basically nothing. Nothing that happens is believable. None of the emotions read as believable, not even the lust (though that's not really an emotion, I suppose). These men are supposed to be super elite soldiers and assassins, but they agonize over everything like teenager, and I don't just mean the emo stuff (though that's non-stop from page one) but if a teammate gets injured or is doing his part of a mission out of sight or killing. All the things a highly trained soldier would take in stride (and we're told they do) they are shown to whinge about. And the technical aspect of these soldiers?

I didn't really care for the plot. It was kind of cliche, and wasn't done as well as I would've liked. I didn't connect with the characters. And all the running from feelings was annoying. It seemed more like some teenager's dream. There were some continuity issues. Like James mentioning FSU in reference to Miami (though I believe it's in Tallahassee) and then later saying University of Miami.  Also, things like being given a car, apartment, cash, etc...seems like it's against the NCAA rules, but I'm not an expert. Things like that threw me off.
Characters: C-
I didn't connect with the characters. Nadine had a hard life, but instead of being sympathetic, I was indifferent. The author didn't make us Feel what happened to her. The full story from start to finish, and not in bits and pieces might have helped.
James wasn't that great of an H. He seems too cocky. And while I usually enjoy some possessiveness, his rubbed me the wrong way. He also could have been an interesting character, overcoming adversity and whatnot, but he just seemed entitled.

The people that don't like it, must have made the mistake of taking it seriously. I mean the Bride (Uma Thurman) is sitting on a plane with a big sword next to her while making a check list of who she wants to kill. That's pure dark humor, that right there is saying that it's not meant to be taken seriously. It's not meant to be realistic. Plus most the dialogue seems like the way a child would talk and not grown-ups. I admit some lines didn't work and made me cringe but they weren't bad enough for me to dislike the movie.  It's meant to be silly, cartoonish and yes extremely violent. When you think about it, wasn't Pulp Fiction the same way ? People are acting like Quentin Tarantino lost his touch but he didn't at all. Plus Volume 1 is basically just a half of a movie so shouldn't judge it until you see the second half. Tarantino took a big chance just releasing one half at a time and it's not fair to hate it when you didn't even see all of it.

It's his most infamous because of a serial killer doing a Donald Duck impression and seeing a lot of women cut up in various gruesome and sick, sick ways.  The film has all the usual Fulci ingredients:  bad story, atrocious dialogue, bad dubbing (though I'm sure this would be a piece of garbage in Italian as well), crappy camera work, just all around unprofessional, tacky, and a complete waste of time.  I kick myself a lot when I decided ""I should give this guy a chance"", so I saw a lot of his films (too many), and I dread the name Fulci, as it is synonymous with ""worst films ever made"".

I think the BBFC did the larger viewing public a disservice when they classified this as a ""video nasty"" (and other Fulci works), because it made many people go out and seek it out.  They should have just let it slide through and labeled it ""mediocre, preposterously s****y, enormous toilet dropping of a movie"".  I sometimes think that because Fulci is so reviled by many that people assume he must be a genius that ""film snobs"" or ""elites"" don't get.  This isn't true at all.  He's just a really bad filmmaker who made a couple of decent films (Zombie is his most consistent), and upped the gore quotient in the horror genre.

Now, he fails not because of the patriotics, the stupidity, the cliches, whatever... he fails because he wrote a bad screenplay, and obtained half-hearted performances by his lead actors.

I asked her, ""If this book is so bad, why don't you quit?"" She said, ""Did you forget that I've had a very stubborn and stupid habit? Once I carelessly picked up a book and once I've started reading that book, no matter how bad it might be, I'd finish it.""

Finally, after about two or three weeks, she actually finished it, and immediately, she threw it into the garbage bin right away. I heard her cursed it several times: ""Disgusting, lousy book! Terrible writing, bad story telling. Have never a book so badly written!""

I also remembered what she told me roughly about this book. It seemed a book about the rich people in Singapore or something. But I just couldn't care more or less. Usually, I'd collect all the books we've finished reading and put them in a carton and then donated either to local library or Salvation Army.

This reader found himself, through much of the book, only liking one character but the good roundup ending caused another to shine even more. Actually, to me, but obviously not to the author, the best and most interesting  character was miserably killed off within the first few pages. So much for me having someone to root for.

Besides the character issues, several times the bunch behaved so unlikely that it damaged the credibility of the book. Of course, you need to suspend belief to read a book like this due to the situation (people back in time 67 mm years) but they need to act like you'd expect a bunch thrown back then to act.

The book starts out rip roaring, sags a good deal in the middle and then finishes in a blur of action and drama.

I have tried every bread knife and slicing guide on the market. Most work fine. (The Mercer bread knife on Amazon  is the best.). It wasn't the knives or the guides, it was ME. I couldn't slice evenly no matter what I did. One end thick, the other thin, you know what I'm talking about right?

When this slicer arrived I had 3 loaves waiting. One was a no knead loaf with a very crunchy, crusty exterior, another a very soft Challah egg bread, and the third, ciabatta rolls.  I had to experiment, of course, to get the right thickness for me. I found that the 12 & 1/2  notch area on the dial made  about a 1/2"" slice and was just right.

The loaves were a bit too big for the pronged pusher at first, so I very carefully sliced off the first three pieces before using it to hold the breads in place. Yes, it's much better to follow the rules and cut the loaf in half to use with the pusher, but well, I was anxious to see how it worked. Talk about impressive! The loaves were sliced into PERFECTLY EVEN slices in a matter of seconds!  Yes, SECONDS!  I knew at that moment that I should not have hesitated getting this slicer.

I got over my thinking that I'll only use this for bread, and I  tried a yam that I had on hand. Wow, yam chips in an instant. I raided the vegetable bin and sliced cabbage, a russet potato, and an onion. I was a slicing fool. I wasn't looking forward to the clean up but it turned out to be less of a bother than I thought. The bread crumbs were blown away with my compressed air can, and all I did to clean the blade was unplug the machine and carefully wipe it with a damp sponge.

The only absolutely negative note about this book was the unnecessarily crude sexual content.  It demeaned the characters who were partly defined by it, and that's a shame.

2) The OEM keyboard a) malfunction, failed to hold the tablet firm and tight, you can take it off and it will just fall out of the slot, even the lock switch on the left shown locked on the right side. b) the malfunction keyboard will not accept the tablet as part of the family, once you put the tablet on the keyboard, the power will suddenly shut off, the screen would blacken out, when you insert the power plug into the keyboard connecting slot, the charging light will not light up. The keyboard totally kills the tablet. You have to take the tablet out and use it as a lone device without the damaging keyboard's interruption.

3) The tablet will mysterious shut off without any reason. You have to press your left hand point finger so hard and maintain the pressure, otherwise the tablet will not awake from the dead.

1003,"I haven't read any of the author's other books so I really didn't know what to expect from this book.  I thought it might be a humorous social satire -- when I told my co-workers the basic story line, they all laughed -- so I decided to take a chance on it. This could have been a scathingly funny book in the hands of a writer who really understands and likes women and can poke fun at our foibles without getting ugly, but this is not that book and apparently not that writer. I just don't find any humor in a man using sex to control and manipulate the female population and the overall feel of the book to me was misogynistic, not humorous.  Reading it made me want to burn it in my driveway to help exorcise it from my mind.

This book has a LOT of sex so don't read it if you aren't comfortable with that.  But all that sex is very unsexy and instead ranged from clinical to gross.  The first three pages of this book were my first clue that this was going to be an unpleasant reading experience.  The main female character is raped in a public courtroom and no one comes to her aid.  The circumstances are explained much later in the book but that passage made me very uncomfortable.

For social satire to be effective, it has to paint an accurate (even if exaggerated) picture of the follies of society it is intending to skewer. The main female character fails in that aspect.  She is supposed to be a young lawyer at a NY firm and the author has her fetching coffee and looking for chairs for a meeting.  Young lawyers do a lot of grunt work but it is all billable legal grunt work. And the notion that nearly all women would buy the Beautiful You products and then abandon their jobs, families and every other aspect of their lives reflect such a poor understanding of what women are like that it makes the book fail for me.

I don't throw around the term misogyny lightly, but this book felt anti-woman from beginning to end.  I really can't recommend that any women read this book.  I suspect that there will be a number of readers who think this book is brilliant and hilarious -- and I suspect that they will be overwhelmingly male.",1,"[-0.22814237093837675, 1.500692186573429, -1.0193631590812218, -0.9848539792935216, -2.042745415263592]",1.500692186573429
5267,"I had so much hope for this book.  The first chapter met that expectation, then it went downhill from there.  It's the story of stay at home mom having to go back to work after her divorce from her cheating husband.  She's hasn't worked in ten years and of course her first job is working for a jerk.  The HR woman loved her on sight, must be nice to get double pay your first hour of working, sign me up!  The rest of the book I was just trying to get through as soon as I could.

Admittedly, I'm not a prank person.  I enjoy a good joke but putting a laxative in another person's drink is cruel, especially when that person didn't physically harm you or do anything except be a jerk, is assault in my opinion. But, hello, bosses can be jerks at times. Maybe that's why her husband left her, she's evil and childish.  I don't know, I couldn't get into all the pranks and honestly if a man had put a laxative or itching powder in a woman's underwear, we'd be screaming assault charges.  I can't even say it was fabulous writing because between stupid, cruel pranks and a sex scene on every other page when they (surprise) get together there's wasn't much to this book.

When you rent this, are you thinking you will see an Academy Award hopeful?  Is it chock full of Golden Globe performances?  Do you really demand full character development in a shoot-em up movie?  If you do, then simply don't rent this DVD.
If you are thinking this movie will blow you away, it won't.  But it is good enough to spend the money on a rental.  Don't believe the harsh reviews on it though.  Those people are just expecting WAY too much from a simple action film.
That's the best way to describe the film:  simple.
Although, the reviewer that comments about all of the gangs magically coming together to take on the police force for the money is spot on.  That was way too stupid, even for this flick.

I mean if this make-up makes your skin as hard as marble, then instead of making it into make-up, why not market it to the military instead of a cosmetic line?  I'm sure they would have a use for it!

And this super smart former professor says the reason she didn't get tenure and no one believed her ""Catwoman"" theory was because of ""male academia.""  Ummm... nooo... it's because that idea is just idiotic and they probably didn't want someone thinking that this stuff was true on their staff and associated with their university!

Another thing that I find stupid about this movie is that when Patience is slipping out of the jail cell by going through the bars, one of them moves and it's obvious that it's made out of rubber or plastic.  Like 60% of this movie is CGI but they couldn't take some of their budget and CGI the bar into not moving to make it look realistic?

1911,"A difficult book to read and significantly more difficult to review.  The difficult part of reading and reviewing was the struggle to suppress my own emotions.  The writers attempt to reveal the mistreatment of Muslim women in particular is noble.  Her life story is one of many emotions, trials and tribulations and the efforts on her part to seek equality on behalf of others reveals a great mind in a great person.  It should be fair to say there are many more like her stymied by their religion and background and yet of equal mind if not courage.  I say this because no single ethnic group or religious sect has a monopoly on brains regardless of gender.  Many people are simply what they are taught to be.  To avoid offending anyone I seldom discuss or give thoughts on religion.  I am not knowledgeable enough to discuss the various aspects of the various religions but like many (I suspect) I entertain my own thoughts and opinions.  While this book taught me some about the particular religion involved it made light of the brutality of life for women living under the justification by that particular religion.  I despise anyone involved in the mistreatment of women.  Certainly in my life I have known bar flies who maybe rated a dope slap but the constant abuse and mistreatment of any woman rates as a punishable sin.  I cannot always say they are the fairer sex unless by fairness one means their attitude and treatment of others, male or female.

60,"My review is based on my purchase of the CD.  As much as I wanted to give 5 stars for the content and insights, the reader was so subpar that I could not.

Advertisers have known all along that economic decisions are often heavily based on social, cognitive and emotional factors.  We can know too.  Author Dan Ariely gave incredible insights into ways that people commonly make irrational decisions.  Sure they were based on college experiments, but we learn a lot about ourselves from the results and Ariely's interpretations.

From knowledge gained studying irrational decision-making, I wonder to what extent we can rationalize behavior.  It seems the complexity of decision-making might be increasing, and the irrational biases are apparently hardwired.  For example, even though we know based on Ariely's research that we put energy into being penny wise and pound foolish regarding certain purchases, it seems likely that smart people will continue to do so.

The solutions posed in the book are really separate from the value of the knowledge gained.  Obviously, government has a legitimate role in consumer protection.  Consumers, working constantly and with no time to research the fine print of every type of deal, should be protected to some extent.  Even so, there is no way government can protect citizens from every pitfall.  It makes me wonder if a type of training could be devised to help me, and all of us, override most irrational impacts on decision-making.",0,"[1.3959625992026992, -0.032474768605203375, -1.5277031932618186, -1.006050395658598, -1.2054882875979183]",1.3959625992026992

I truly enjoyed reading this book. My heart broke for Alexis because of what made her the way she is. Leo omg he is just wow. My Heart broke for him in certain parts because of, well because you have to read it to know why my heart broke for him in certain parts of the book. Leo also had me at wow, because of what he had to show Alexis on December 31st!!!
Another favorite quote-
""Alexis, if you don't come, I can't come back to work for you. I can't see you every day. It's killing me. I can't sleep, I can't eat. I'm drowning in you and I don't know which way is up. Just say you'll come. It's important.""

I was really disappointed.  I found both Sed and Jessica incoherent,  badly written characters who were impulsive and fundamentally uninteresting.  Anyone who likes to have sex with famous people in public,  can't be devastated if it's caught on video.  Jessica seemed to have no ability to project into the future.  It would absolutely harm her future in corporate america if she worked as a stripper,  but still,  she did it. It would absolutely make a difference to her law school if a sex tape came out,  but still she kept putting herself in situations where it was almost inevitable.  Sed and Jess loved having sex with each other but didn't understand each other at all,  and by the end I was happy to leave them

I will not buy the next in the series.

9447,"127 Hours is one of the better movies I have seen in the last few years. A climber falls and gets his arm stuck. He can't free himself and the film shows his experiences over 127 hours of agony. It never gets boring, manages to tell a simple but believable story and allows you to empathize with the main character's plight. Camp and comedy are avoided here in favor of an effectively dramatic performance about one man's ordeal. What struck me was how easily anyone can relate to this situation in some way. I'm surprised more people haven't rated and reviewed this little gem. It got 6 Oscar nominations but only managed to break even at the box office. The picture and audio quality are superb in this release. There is 103 minutes of bonus content.

2330,"First off long before the Mormon indoctrination in the book began about 1/3 into the book I was a bit bothered by the ""hero "" of the story.  He is attempting to help a stranded motorist by offering to put her up at her mothers house but tells her to change her clothing first because she looks like a prostitute.  Even if she was dressed in appropriately I found this offensive.  It seemed to improve a bit but still had awkward moments.  The when you are about one third of the way through the Mormon indoctrination starts and clearly the author wants to pound you over the head with it.

I try to be fair in my reviews and I often say the same thing about Christian books that are to heavy handed in their approach.  I don't mind an author weaving faith into a storyline but I do mind when I don't know what I'm getting myself into upfront.  I went back and read the book description as it stands today and didn't see anything that would lead me to know this was a LDS book and would contain so much propaganda.

But at the end of the day Joss Whedon's ironic humor, Amy Acker's portrayal of the witty and whimsical Beatrice, and the war of the sexes between Beatrice and Benedict won me over.

But later found out that only loathing, disgust and despise to each other, a deep cynicism remained in their marriage. And in this pathetic and another highly unlikely film, we had an old fart, a walking-dead and walking-stiff American(?), played by the English, Sir Michael Caine, a widower aimlessly and mindlessly lived in Paris, the city of forever romance, just awaiting the Guy in the Black Hole to summon him anytime. Then miracle happened, a miracle that could only happened in a MOVIE; he met a young French woman twice younger his age. Then he suddenly rejuvenated, started to shave his white beard daily, had his fuzzy hairs on an almost baldy head professionally cut, shampooed and hair saloon-ed. Then his son with a broken marriage showed up and messed up the relationship and took over.

Sure, it's about a worthy and important subject (working class woman having trouble surviving and paying the rent, so she smuggles people across the border), but that doesn't make it a good film.  Melissa Leo's and Misty Upham's performances are decent (I actually think Misty is better than Melissa), but other performances are laughable, mainly because they're so badly written that they end up being unintentionally hilarious when they're supposed to be somber (like Michael O'Keefe's portrayal of a state trooper).

10000,"At this point they have had enough time. The fanboys are covering for a game that has been all but completely broken since release. There some good points but way too many negative points to even think about a three star review at this point. I took my review down to see if they would have this fixed by christmas. Well, that has not happened and the game is still buggy, slow, and has too many problems for it to get anything but one or two stars. Other games have been fixing their mistakes and this one seems like it just cannot get there in time for anything to matter.

This is M's flagship franchise. The reviews all praised it to high heaven despite it being near-broken. That was step one in the problem. No pro reviewer worth their salt ever mentioned how buggy this game was. And you think people are not getting paid to shill on this release? Or in the least they are sent out their own game which they play with fellow reviewers and no one else.... those are the only two options.

Single player still has tons of glitches. Halo 2 is a mess and there was no need to run two engines at once in the game as it isn't even true 1080p ffs. Halo 3 needed a full HD release by itself and instead got some half-assed release that barely looks any different than the 360. There is a huge lack of anisotropic shading to make anything defined in the distance. There are tons of jaggies. I could go on and on.... the biggest problem is the matchmaking which just isn't worth my time. Get Dragon Age or Sunset instead and reward a developer that did their job. Microsoft released this for the Holidays and I am sure they were well aware of its problems.

Character development of the heroine was jerky and not written clearly;  the reader understands that Paige goes from physically and emotionally damaged wimp to strong magical ruling chick, but the writer fails to take us on that journey and instead more announces this.  Also, the physical scars which Paige allowed to rule her are never noted after the beginning.  My big issue is that college-attending Paige comes off really really stupid: she doesn't remember things anyone tells her, she shows no insight or reasoning abilities, and she struggles to comprehend things other Earth women easily mastered or understood.  Not impressive when it comes to heroines.

I don't know if they ran a bad batch or if some dogs reacted to an ingredient that was sourced from a different supplier when they made it, but there does not appear to be any difference in the formula from what I can see on the labels of the 38.5 size bage and this newly packaged size of 35 pounds. The ingredients listed are identical, if I was to guess why this new listing for a 35 pound bag and the 38.5 pound  bag being ""out of stock"" now is their way to get away from people reading how this formula made a lot of dogs sick over the past 4-5 months when people read the most recent reviews.

My dogs all ate it up like it was candy, none appeared ill after wards, bowels were a bit softer as I did not transition them, I wanted to see if it made any of them sick. At first I only gave a little, then I gave them a full meal when 8 hours had passed and I saw no negative reactions. Then I gave them it for 2 days and so far all is good.
I think that whatever the problem was they fixed it.  BUT ALWAYS read the most recent reviews on any dog food as so many have been recalled due to  changes in formulas or who supplied the manufacturer with the ingredients..
I do not like the way they went about it, I would rather the mnfr commented and told how they resolved the issue and was above board but regardless it appears that this one is good to go now, All my dogs liked it and its nutritional value is in keeping with the other dog foods that have grain in them, you will pay  a LOT more for the grain free types.",1,"[-0.2024322767612341, 1.1946264242625055, -0.9770605313330651, -1.026963029120021, -1.4006621767380316]",1.1946264242625055

This story was an emotional rollercoaster ride. There was dangerous situations, sacrifices, anger, angst, commitment, loyalty, happiness and love.
The love two people can share only in a great romance book is here. Sacrifices and putting your partner ahead of your own desires. The agony of despair when all is felt lost. The gathering of family and friends uniting to bring happiness no matter what. And the partner who is never willing to give up the one thing they so desired from the other - Love.
This book had me from Chapter one and I could not put it down. Anna knows how to capture one's attention. The characters are so well written and the interaction between the two is hot! Oh, there is lots of sex too. I highly recommend this book to my friends and family. Congratulations, Anna! I am so excited that I had the opportunity to read this amazingly well-written story.

The plot is different and with a different or much improved same author could have been a good book.

The book moved slow and was too long.  If you removed all the brand names in the book you would save pages and what did the scene about Justin's play add to the book.  It really crossed over the lines of friendship and probably few legal ones to, truth be known.

5723,Some books reach inside you with whispers some books are words on a page that mash together and have you feeling bits and pieces.. And then there are those books that scream at you and each word tumbles into your soul and fills you up and has you turned inside out and outside in and whispers to your heart and thats when a book turns into something much more than just a book... Kennedy Ryan is a mastermind when it comes to joining words together to make a story ( that is so much more than just a story its a journey). She takes your heart with her hands and pumps her words through you and breaks your heart because the words the words are so much more they are jagged pieces that cut they are real and their edges will cut.. and then she takes that same heart she just shredded and puts it back together.

Then again, it is based on the gendre of ""graphic novels"", which are essentially comic books for adults who never learned to read in schools(working too hard on their self-esteem and too little on their studies?).  For this reason, I had low expectations.

They make no sense, they are so ridiculously cheap, the dialogue is horrendous (in both the English dub and the original Italian version), and the acting is atrocious.  However, they are rather nasty in their gore.  You do remember it in all of his films.  Here, it's acid getting poured on someone's face, a man's face being eaten by tarantulas, and the usual zombies getting their brains splattered everywhere.  The ending is a bit surreal (which I usually like endings like that), but I don't know whether it was intentional or just an accident because of lazy, incompetent filmmaking.  I have seen many Fulci films, including House by the Cemetary, Cat in the Brain, New York Ripper, etc..  I saw this one twice.  The first time was with a friend, and she wouldn't shut up during it, commenting on how bad it was.  So I rented it again, and it was as bad as she said it was.  I even watched the original Italian version with English subtitles, and it was still awful.  People swear Fulci's a genius.  You can see his influence on many horror films today, with their emphasis on gore, incoherency, underdeveloped storylines, junk dialogue, and bad acting.  I read that Lucio was originally a comedy director in Italy, and he worked with Toto the Clown, one of the most famous clowns/actors in Italy during his heyday.

1302,"I've been a sporadic reader of Gothic romance since my teens (a very, very long time). I favor the ones without paranormal elements and, in that respect, Jennifer St. Giles' Gothics work for me.  In this one, for example, there is just a touch of the paranormal with the heroine and her sister having slight psychic abilities.  Other than that, this is a pretty straightforward Victorian Gothic.

What bothered me about this, as opposed to other St. Giles Gothics I've read, is that I felt it needed better editing to eliminate excess tangential subplots, wordiness, and repetitiveness, and there was a failure to fully realize the mystery plot and its resolution.  There was TMI about unimportant things, such as the h's sisters' strange ""tea"" parties with the H's brother and friends, or the h's preoccupation with restricted personal hygiene (although rather funny at first) when working undercover as a maid, the strange nighttime activities of the H speculated upon ad infinitum, etc. and not enough time spent getting into the mystery.

What's the mystery?  There were two murders, one of a woman some 8 years ago and the recent death of the h's cousin Mary.  Cassie, our h, infiltrates the house where Mary had been governess to a young blind girl, pretending to be a maid.  She spends most of her time making friends with another young maid, yearning for baths and uselessly exploring the house at night. I say ""uselessly"" as far as making any headway into the mystery of Mary's death, but it was very useful for meeting the H, who closets himself away during the day and is up all night making mysterious noises.

Because the book seemed excessively long to me, I tended to skim and read quickly towards the end.  Perhaps because of this I did not find much satisfaction with the ending.  Yes, the romance ended with an HEA but I remained a bit puzzled about the first murder, the one 8 years ago.  Not wishing to go back and read more carefully, I'll just resign myself to not knowing.

This was free.  As such, it's an OK read, but, IMO, not if you have to pay for it.  I doubt I'll read the sequels unless they are offered for free at some point.",1,"[-1.6339067032277277, 1.1502738359382807, -0.6087705484789839, -0.97746061270164, -2.461958409124077]",1.1502738359382807

I didn't enjoy this at all. I struggled finishing it.
I think it had potential if the writing was good.
The writing is not good at all.
Each character does a lot of talking.
The characters are young, maybe that is why I couldn't get into it. I mean when hero and heroine kiss, people make gagging noises and tells them to get a room, and that is in the epilogue.
I feel if it had character growth and better writing this could have been a good read, especially with the real life situations it was tackling. It was just poorly written. And not enough.
The details are lacking which ruins the romance.
I didn't like the epilogue, Dean got a home, yet there was no happy ever after. It was more happy for now, or just settling every one of the situations into the epilogue.

There were major changes happening and I had this ""awww, they're all grown up"" feeling happening. It was awesome! This was a really well rounded, fun story to read and it just made my heart happy.

Love when all the couples get together. They've forms such great friendships and they're own little family and I enjoy all their interactions and personalities. It was all so entertaining. It was fun seeing George again too... he was in one of my favorite scenes! Seriously hysterical!

What a year these siblings have been through!!!!  Completing the four siblings tales, Levi picks up the plot and finds what his siblings have already found!  Continuing also with Tess I really LOVED her stories continuation!  There's a scene where she and another character are so open and honest about what they are feeling!  I LOVED it!  It is so refreshing among the suspense and turmoil of hidden secrets and feelings from other characters!  With the characters coming together in REALLY GREAT scenes and their pasts colliding with their present, this is a highly entertaining read and became one of my favorites of the series!

8082,"OK, I'll be honest, I thought I would find some hot BDSM in this book; I'm now programmed to assume that when I see the word ""Obedient"" in the title anymore.  I'm sure that's due to all the FSOG takeoffs I have read, not sure that's a good thing, it just is.  So when I got into this book I kept waiting, and waiting, and waiting for some to show up.  I mean, even a blindfold would be the very least I would expect to see.  There were some sex scenes, but I had to laugh because the sex scenes throughout the story ended up being the cliffhangers in and of themselves, a take that you don't read very often.

The plot is different and interesting, I can't honestly say that I didn't put it down and leave it for a bit, but something always made me come back to it if that helps you at all.

I was more involved in this book reality show that I am involved in most TV reality shows. It was highly addicting.

There were so many exciting and unexpected moments. There were moments my heart wanted to leap out of my chest. Loved the relationships that were formed.

7793,"I have had this mattress for months now, and it is still like the first day I bought it.

I have always bought `traditional' mattresses. My last one was a Sealy Posturpedic and was not even 3 years old!  It sagged so badly on one side. It also made a lot of noise when I turned at night. It literally was giving me a complex. I am not a big person and do not weigh much so when your bed is making noise when you turn, you tend to think maybe your bed is trying to tell you something. In my case it was telling me what junk it was.

When this mattress came it was compressed and left at my front door. It was hard to carry it in by myself. I had a friend come over, who handles packages at UPS, open it for me and we both moved it into my bedroom. I have a platform bed but to be safe, I bought some additional wood (smooth) at Lowe's hardware so it was more than level. The mattress has a cover on it and has a grip feeling on the underside so it stays in place. I am sensitive to smell and did not notice a smell on the bed. I let it air out all afternoon and evening, and was able to sleep on it that same night.

I will say it is very firm. It is not too firm for me though. I have a waterproof mattress pad on top of it, a pillow top one, and a heated mattress pad. I was scared I could not use the heated mattress pad but have not had any issues with it. I keep it on top on the other pads.

I can not think of any complaints with this mattress. I was concerned about the edges. Someone wrote that they went down if you sat on the edge. I will say that is not true. Mine holds up very well, if not better than a traditional mattress.

I wanted to wait a few months before posting my review to see if the mattress changed shape or form but it has not. I love crawling into bed. I will mention I have arthritis in my knees, hips, and hands. I also had/have back issues due to a difficult pregnancy. I could not walk for months. However, with physical therapy and sleeping in this bed, I do not wake up with any pain at all. It hugs my pain at night.

I highly recommend this mattress and for the price you can't go wrong.",1,"[0.8426963100132248, 1.0991668604483835, -1.5757187767787235, -1.033448360050694, -0.7957419861432344]",1.0991668604483835

Thanks to Amazon for highlighting that for me and saving me some $$ in the process.
The book tells the story of a campaign manager hired by his Virginia based client to win him a U.S. Senate seat. Sounds innocent on its face from the start, but gets really involved through out the course of the story right down to the bitter end!
I don't re tell story lines in my reviews, but suffice it to say this book has all the elements of a great read. Character development of the protagonists and antagonists is well done. Plot holds interest from page one to page last. The story line is a bit far fetched but largely plausible nonetheless in its unraveling.
No question, this writer does know how to spin a yarn. I really liked this book and recommend it to every political  wonk out there.",3,"[-2.89473942687212, -1.3760685942723676, -1.3334796676512037, -0.9753091873328161, -1.1976975592177699]",-0.9753091873328161

While she tries to sort through her existential angst she takes a job as a nanny for a wealthy Manhattan family and bcomes an observer rather than a participant in life.

And what does she discover?
1- Money can't buy happiness
2- Possessions are no substitute for quality time with loved ones and
3- Children are your greatest gift in life.
Are you getting all of this down on paper?

I received a copy of The Bluebonnet Betrayal from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for my honest review.

Description From the Publisher:

Pru's life in England is coming full circle. A Texas transplant, she's married to the love of her life, thriving in the plum gardening position she shares with her long-lost brother, and prepping a Chelsea Flower Show exhibit featuring the beloved bluebonnets of the Texas hill country. Technically, Twyla Woodford, the president of a gardening club in the Lone Star State, is in charge of the London event, but Pru seems to be the one getting her hands dirty. When they finally do meet, Pru senses a kindred spirituntil Twyla turns up dead.

Although Twyla's body was half buried under a wall in their display, Pru remains determined to mount a spectacular show. Twyla would have insisted. So Pru recruits her husband, former Detective Chief Inspector Christopher Pearse, to go undercover and do a bit of unofficial digging into Twyla's final hours. If Pru has anything to say about it, this killer is going to learn the hard way not to mess with Texas.

My Review:

The characters continue to grow with this series.  Each new book brings more depth to Pru and her relationships with the other characters, both old and new.  As always Marty Wingate writes a plot that even thought it moves quickly from scene to scene it is not rushed like the rapids on a river, but rather like a gentle bubbling book that soothes.  Readers will quickly fall in love with the Potting Shed Mysteries.  The series is memorable and fun to read.  My rating is 4.25 out of 5 stars.",4,"[-1.7229443491644805, -1.511552358357469, -1.3270788743784263, -0.9753282248336291, -1.287189041417082]",-0.9753282248336291

Ken is an owner of a boxing studio and is new to the neighborhood. While he was doing some repairs at home he accidentally knocked down his neighbors fence. Lydia is shocked when her hot young neighbor coming ringing her door bell. She doesn't really care about the fence but he is stubborn about fixing it so she agrees to talk to him the next day about it. Ken is attracted to his neighbor but doesn't think she would be interested in him since he's younger and she has a son. They start the next day out talking about what supplies they'll need to fix the fence. They have lunch and start to get to know one and another. After they buy the supplies they make plans to meet up again. Things heat up between them pretty quick and then someone tries to throw some drama in to cause trouble between them. Ken backs off because of a warning someone gave him but he learns pretty quick its false information but will it be too late to claim Lydia as his own?

This was a great story and will keep you turning pages til you find yourself at the end. The chemistry between Ken and Lydia is electrifying. If you haven't read anything by this author then this would be a great book o start with.

289,"I love a good family drama, especially with Brits! Add a hefty dash of British humor and I'm all in.  ""The Past"", by Tessa Hadley, is a thoroughly entertaining and addicting story of a family of middle-aged siblings as they reunite for a three-week summer vacation in their grandparent's old and crumbling country manse. We have frivolous Alice and her ex-boyfriend's son, Kasim, orderly oldest daughter Harriet, solid Fran, the youngest and her two delightfully written children Ivy and Arthur. Then there is brother Roland and his new (third) wife Pilar, and his daughter Molly to round out the house party. At first I found Alice to be irritatingly scattered, but by the end I had an entirely different opinion of her. In fact, my feelings for all of the characters changed as the story unfolded.

I'm the oldest of five and so I  can easily identify with (and enjoy!) all the Sturm und Drang of sibling relationships, which just intensified my enjoyment of this novel. In addition, Hadley's prose is gorgeous; her luscious descriptions of the bucolic setting, and shambling old house, brought me right into the setting.

""The Past"" is the kind of novel that illustrates the importance of novels in our lives. There is real value in reading about a character's inner monologue. Hadley is extremely gifted at writing about what her characters are thinking about. The importance for us is that reading about what others think, and why, helps us to gain insight and understanding of the world and the people in it. In striving to understand our fellow human beings, we gain so much: sympathy, empathy, understanding, even sometimes disdain and revulsion.

Warning: unfortunately this publication does not use quotations marks. However, quotes are indicated with leading dashes...it's still difficult and distracting to read, but it's better than nothing (marginally). Despite that, I highly recommend this enthralling and well-paced tale.",4,"[-3.521065396459175, -2.025438067491346, -1.7250535809043197, -0.9755392491144533, -1.0266954739426448]",-0.9755392491144533

Elliott so famously wrote, April is the cruelest month, and as Easter approaches, the residents decide to hold a seance to rid their vacant, creepy manor house of the malevolent spirits that have wreaked such havoc among them. Its a daunting prospect, but something that must be done. One of their number dies of fright, and early the next morning, Inspector Armande Gamache arrives on what has by now become for him a familiar crime scene.

The charm of Louise Pennys series derives from her eloquent writing style. This woman knows her way around words. She breathes atmosphere into her setting and humanity into her characters, and her plots are always intricate enough to sustain the mystery even after you think you know who did it. Gamache has to be one of the warmest, most ethical and understanding detectives ever invented. His success is due to his principles, one of which is that murder always starts with a secret. Penny doesnt shrink from illuminating his flaws, however, which makes him all the more human. The murder at the center of The Cruelest Month has him genuinely puzzled, and events during the investigation leave him wondering whom among his team can be trusted. Gamache, of course, eventually prevails, but not without some ingenious plotting of his own. As another famous author, Norman Mailer, once wrote,In searching for the truth be ready for the unexpected.

Its not necessary to read the Three Pines novels in order, but thats the way to get the most out of everything that Penny does so well.",3,"[-2.0003199831370044, -0.9857670573701358, -1.2444848805691868, -0.9755568437277524, -1.2473430473749918]",-0.9755568437277524

Byron worked hard to earn his mother's approval and to make her happy without receiving any display of affection in return.

Ride Hard is the second installment in the Condemned Angels MC series.  Ride Hard wraps up the story of Roxy and Chase and continues the story of Jeremy and Nicole.

When a new neighbor moves in, Charley notices strange things.  Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon) is suave and sophisticated and is never seen before sunset.  When some girls start missing, Charley starts to suspect that Jerry might be a vampire.  When he cannot convince anyone else of this, he goes to Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowell).  Peter, at first, is skeptical, like the rest.  But eventually Charley brings him around.

Charley, Amy and Vincent go against Dandridge.  Of course, you know how it has to end.  This film combines comedy with horror to make a fine hybrid.  Roddy McDowell was a great character actor in early days of MGM (best as Liz Taylor's sidekick.)  This was a comeback for McDowell.

There was just enough gore and lore (haha!) to make the zombies interesting and a ""real"" part of the character's lives without it being ""all about zombies"" or going too much into ""how the zombies came to be"" (which I can't remember even being apart of the story, which I thought was quite refreshing- a zombie book minus the whatever horrible circumstance that caused them to become such monsters but it didn't detract at all from the story!).

3065,"Graham Norton has written an engaging first Novel in Holding. Set in a small town Duneen, Ireland, Norton paints an exquisite picture of the counterpoint between familiarity of small town life and the inability to achieve a sense of privacy and anonymity. The challenge of achieving this balance is richly portrayed via the introduction and development of the six main characters and how their lives and emotions are intertwined as big news rocks their small town.

Each chapter has readers periodically checking in on a different character and their emotions as the plot develops. Nortons transitions here are so well done as to be effortless. The flow and pace of his writing is very smooth and makes you want to keep reading to not break the rhythm. Each character is believable with their personalities and idiosyncrasies deftly revealed in a way that makes them increasingly familiar. This connected me in a way that made me feel that I too was a resident. Norton also uses his comedic talent to cleverly and enjoyably deliver a periodic turn of phrase, just enough to leave you longing for the next one.

My one criticism is the plot had little tension. There was no real suspense, sense of foreboding, or danger despite the story being built on the mysterious death of a well known inhabitant. For me, a little more tension or surprise would have made it that much more enjoyable. Upon reflection a few days later, however, I came to realize that the characters would stand up regardless of plot which to Nortons credit is precisely the point.

With more suspense or foreboding, Holding would be a full 4 star read rather than 3.5 stars.",3,"[-3.6815030900404375, -1.496899213652047, -1.6997486957040129, -0.9763026461206046, -1.3493834662318407]",-0.9763026461206046

700,"Years ago, I read in a book that President James Garfield was killed by a disgruntled civil servant. No, that's not really the truth.
In ""Destiny of the Republic"" the author writes an incredible historical account of James Garfield who becomes President only to
have his term shortened by a madman with a pistol and a medical community without a clue.

Millard's book is like reading a mystery/thriller. Garfield, a man who was raised in poverty and rose to be a President of a college by age 26, was a man
who spent his life reading, learning and becoming a brilliant man and an astute politician as well as a Civil War General. Everything he does seems to
work out and his life is painted as a man destined to become President of the United States even if he had his doubts that he could really
be the President of our nation.

Meanwhile, a crazed man, Charles Guiteau is lurking in the shadows. Millard does a brilliant job explaining their lives and how their lives
will cross as Guiteau is convinced he deserves a promininent government position. In the book, the underlying issue in politics was the idea
of a merit system versus a spoils system of putting people into government jobs which had split the Republican Party into two distinct camps. Garfield
refuses to deal with Republicans who believe in a spoils system and Guiteau has his own ideas about Garfield and his destiny.

Does Guiteau kill Garfield? I will let you read the book to find out if he was the real killer. Bad medicine, egotistical doctors, and one of our
great inventors are all involved in dealing with Garfield as he tried to recover from the attempted assassination.

This is the type of history book that people need to read. It is just outstanding and paints a picture of this nation during that time that is vivid, somewhat scary, and reminds us how different we were in so many ways just over a century ago and how politics was as ugly then as it is now.",4,"[-1.854499355942925, -1.4736445297217526, -1.3817016336927888, -0.9763740959586642, -1.2199704019814843]",-0.9763740959586642

Even though I probably would have never chosen this book if it hadn't been a daily deal, I usually don't read books taking place in the 1600's, I completely enjoyed it.

It is the story of Slecna Marketa Pichlerova a bathmaid and the bloodletter's daughter.  I didn't even know that there was such a thing as a bathmaid, which is basically a girl who helps others (mostly men, it seems) bathe.  She prepares their water and washes them, providing other *duties*.  But Marketa is not your everyday average bathmaid, she is the daughter of Zigmund Pichler the barber-surgeon.  She is fascinated by the bloodletting and the science of bloodletting.

When Don Julius, the King's mad bastard son is imprisoned in a castle that overlooks her baths, he falls madly in love with Marketa.

I totally fell into the story.  Loved all the characters, from Annabella, the witch healer, to Jakub Horicicky de Tenepec - the rosy chemist born and raised in Cesky Krumlov.

I enjoyed the story so much that I even read the author's note and found that her inspiration came from a true historical event - the scandalous butchery of the bathmaid Marketa Pichlerova in 1608.",3,"[-2.921950211915612, -1.3261311628110444, -1.3609700216881353, -0.976379860845173, -1.148465127866917]",-0.976379860845173

I really enjoyed the evolution of Darius and Taylor's relationship. They had so many ups and downs and struggles. I thought they had good character development even though it wasn't super in depth, and I enjoyed learning their history together and their back stories. Darius is such a complicated man and I didn't get all of his choices or motivations behind them right away, but by the end, I totally understood and was a well of emotion when he finally opens up. I really liked Taylor and her strength. She was going through such a hard time and had a lot to work through but I liked her perseverance.

I liked Darius and Taylors chemistry and heat and hotness, and the draw they had to one another, it made their reconnecting pretty instant. More than that though, there was a level of caring there that was super sweet. I liked them but they both frustrated me as they were fighting their feelings, some making me a bit crazy with their back and forth but I love how they got there in the end giving me a great HEA.

The first half kind of drove me crazy. There was so much push and pull which can be exhausting, but its easier to accept when the motivations are strong. I didn't feel that that was the case in John and Tuesdays initial relationship. The reasons for it just didn't seem to be strong enough and often times within mere moments this couple were pushing when they had just been pulling and it was on both their parts. I almost gave up on them because they were really starting to annoy me.

However, once I passed the fifty percent mark, this story took off and I couldn't be happier about the fact that I stuck it out. While I never really connected with Tuesday, I became deeply invested in John. And when he has his epiphany I was in tears.

Bric, Quin and Smith had a unique friendship and their background story was something I couldn't wait to know more about. They each had their own rule when they had their two days with Marchella and it definitely gave their chemistry and connection a boost.
Marchella was also a very mysterious woman. Why she chose to take another woman's place was the million dollar question. Also what was her story because like the three men she also had a different view and an insatiable appetite for sex. The reader will get the answer to all those questions and so much more.
They all played the game and tried to manipulate each other which also added some suspense to the story.

Taking Turns wasn't just a story about four people having sex. No, there was an intriguing storyline and also compelling characters.

Cecelia and Mary have been orphaned two years ago when their parents died in a carriage accident. The only relatives who agreed to keep them were the horrible Uncle Herbert and Aunt Selene. In fact, they were completely bankrupt and wanted to get their hands on Cecelia's dowry, for it made her marry their son, Percy.

But her meeting was failure, and when she got out of there completely desolate and distracted, she ends up being hit by a carriage, falls down and gets knocked out.
Cecelia is saved by a gentleman who saw everything, taking her to his brother house, Derek Hunt, the Duke of Claringdon.

Reckless is the first in the Pier 70 series, based around the lives of Cam, Dare, Roan and Teague. There is quite a bit of set up for the series, but this is Cam's story.

Cam Strickland has been in a dry spell for a while, and it has been a long time since he has had a reaction to another man.

Gannon Burgess is all work no play, and doesn't even want to be at the marina, but his best friend Milly has other ideas for him and his workers.

Cam and Gannon could not come from two more different worlds, but their attraction to each other knows no bounds. You can feel the pull between them right from the get go. There is some great banter between the two, along with shameless ogling!

I loved how their friends saw so much between them, pushed the issue with them to make them take that step into ""relationshipville"".

I got a little frustrated with Cam and his pull/push with Gannon. As we learn more of his past, yes I could understand his actions why more, but I still wanted to shake some sense into him. I felt Ms Edwards dealt with his demons, his personal issues very well.

I loved the interactions between Gannon and Milly, and Cam's interactions with Dare, Teague and Roan. These went from downright hilarious to heartbreakingly tender.

There was some scenes with Cam and Roan that brought a tear to my eye.

I hope Roan's story is next, as I feel it is going to be an emotional ride.

But then again, I think Dare, Roan and Teague are all going to have intriguing stories.

Reckless is great start to the Pier 70 series, and I am looking forward to more in the future.

She brings this iconic figure to life.  You could very well forget that you are reading a novel rather than an actual autobiography and I appreciated the fact that the story is written directly towards the reader.  It's coming right at you, where you are identified as Reader.  To which each time I thought, oh yes I am here 100 percent!  Of course how else would a performer tell their story?  The author states, there is much information available as to Vinnie's performance life, touring and travels, her wedding to another ""perfect person in miniature"" General Tom Thumb.  Those points did hold interest for me, as I didn't know much about the history ahead of time.  What Melanie Benjamin has done with this creation however, is give us a colorful story to go with the stark facts. Vinnie may have been seen as a curiosity by the world but Benjamin gives her so much more depth than the limits of her size.  You are pulled in and you ""get to know"" this character and those close to her.  It shows her pride, frustrations, aspirations and disappointments.  Vinnie shares secrets with her Reader that nobody in her life is aware of.

929,"When Christ and His Saints Slept is the first of a trilogy of historical fiction planned by Sharon Kay Penman. The journey through history extends from 1120 to 1154. In 1120 on the fateful voyage of the White Ship Henry I's heir apparent William is drowned with the rest of the passengers. Without a legitimate male heir to the throne Henry I named his daughter Maude to be his successor.  This decision proved to have dire consequences for  England.  Penman deftly describes the resulting times of struggle and turbulence.
Maude's cousin Stephen sized the throne before she was crowned empress thereby plunging England into a period of unrest, war and crime.  Stephen is portrayed as a great warrior, but uncertain king. He is easily swayed by advisors who jockeyed for influence and prestige. He lacked the ruthlessness which was necessary for a leader of those times, because of his reluctance to mete out punishment  called for by medieval standards.
While Maude has the resolution to be empress, she lacks the compassion and flexibility to rule with authority. Maude was unable to see that she had to win support, rather than demand it as a her right as a ruler.  She eventually understands that the struggle is not against Steven, but for her son Henry.
Penman introduces us to an intriguing cast of characters during an intriguing period of history.  Ranulf, a bastard son of Henry I, is a loyal and sensitive supporter of his sister Maude.  Penman involves us in his friendships, loves and battles. Ranulf is a complex character who is strongly loyal, while searching for his place in a dangerous time.
Penman is commended for bringing to life medieval England.  Fans of these times should not miss this book.",4,"[-1.606414095650668, -1.3419203260881511, -1.4663685497443, -0.9771364101233397, -1.1086746869917619]",-0.9771364101233397
9905,"In addition to appreciating the reviews here that speak well of this product's performance and persuaded me to buy it,  I also appreciate its small (5""x3""x2"")size, and that its reader-friendly user guide includes:  (1) Both an easy-to-find list of  the multiplicity of places where you should NOT put a CO detector--which in my smallish house reduces the options considerably--and a (much shorter) list of locations where it should work best, along with easy-to-understand explanations of the whys of all that. (2) That it makes the should-be-easy-to-remember suggestion that you replace its  three  AA batteries every time you reset the clocks and  recommends several brands--presumably ones that  should last at least that long between changes.  (3) That it provides a space on the side of the device to write in  the date, seven years from now, when the device itself needs replacing--a placement where you're most likely to notice it whenever you take it off the wall to change the batteries.

Now, if only monoxide and smoke detector makers could  find more forgiving  ways to call our attention to a shorter-than-expected battery life, or our occasional  maintenance tardiness, than sending us stumbling, bleary eyed and half awake, all over the house in the middle of the night, trying to figure out and silence whichever of our household's protective devices is not only NOT alarmed about anything, but just screaming  its decibels out that it needs a new battery.

In the meantime: 1. Read user guide re placement before picking a spot and drilling holes in the wall.  2. Figure out what this year's time change dates are for where you live and mark them on your calendar with note to replace all detector batteries. 3.

5739,"I like this series of books. They are totally different from the suspense/mystery novels I read. This series is set in the 1300's, which requires methods of detecting and investigating than what we have today.

The main character is Hugh de Singleton, who is both a surgeon and bailiff. As I commented on an earlier book in this series, I find the methods of surgery and doctoring in that day fascinating.

This book, Trail of Ink, starts off a bit slowly, but then picked up and grabbed my interest. The story involves stolen books, and I figured it wasn't going to be a story involving murder and mayhem, but I was wrong. Thought it may have been slower getting to the suspenseful moments than the two books that preceded this one, it has a lot of suspense in it also, and even some romance thrown in - although that is also a lot different than modern day romances.

The author has studied medieval surgery and medieval English, and that comes across in the book. Reading his books are like stepping into medieval times. He paints a great picture of what life was like in that day, and adds mystery and suspense to make it even more enjoyable.

I have one complaint about the book. There is a glossary in the front of the book to define some of the unfamiliar words in the book, but there are still several used that are not in the glossary. I would have liked a definition of those also.

I highly recommend this series.

Well now it's explained!

When Rick has to go home to take care of his mother Leanne and Art's store, after Art suffers a brain aneurysm, he must confront these memories and truly remember what he owes to them.

There is also a sweet, romantic side-story that I thought was done well, especially considering the male author. I did not expect the big plot-twist at all, and though it could have come across as unrealistic or cheesy, it felt very natural in the progression of the story.

One thing I also have to touch on is the setting - who would have thought that a Florida setting of the fictitious town of Seabreeze would have been cozy, but it is! The setting really enriched the story. The Book Nook store that Rick's parents own felt so realistic to me, and I longed to visit it myself as well as the small, coastal town.

The treatment is nothing else but to touch these women's private parts until they reach ""paroxysmal convulsions"" (wink, wink). The young doctor along with his buddy eventually come up with a mechanical device, which became the vibrator (still the number one sex toy in the world today, we are reminded at the end of the movie).

He breathes animation into each, as if this writer has temporarily inhabited that ""self"" long enough to realize an accurate portrayal. What I most appreciate: this novella opens a door that I can enter, experience, then leave, confident in the truth distilled from each individual. Reading Shopgirl, I had the sense that this author sees the world as I do, observant, yet unencumbered by the need for judgment.
Some of the phrasing is idiosyncratic: ""the smell of Thanksgiving is in the air, which means that Christmas is in the oven."" Other passages are striking for their insight into male/female behavior: (her)""...everytime she sacrifices a bit of herself, she gives him a little more of her that her cannot give back."" And (him)""...not understanding that what he is taking from her is torn from her, believes that the arrangement is fair."" Then, ""She has learned that her body is precious and mustn't be offered carelessly, as it holds a direct connection to her heart. She sheathes herself...and learns never to give away more than is given to her.""
What seems to be a tale of the loneliness and arbitrary impulses of the single life, albeit with the possibility of a happy ending, is actually a perceptive portrait of the transitional stages of life, seen through the images of an artist who paints in words.",3,"[-2.0989311170180827, -1.469377040380102, -1.2978099509733552, -0.9780410553147169, -1.28202919804332]",-0.9780410553147169
557,"Having heard so much about this book I felt obligated to read it and see for myself why it has generated so much buzz. As someone who didn't know a tremendous amount about the story going in, I found the book to be much more violent and horrifying than I expected.

The book consists of two storylines involving disgraced financial reporter Mikael Blomkvist, and socially-inept hacker Lisbeth Salander. Together the two are trying to uncover the mystery surrounding the death of corporate heiress Harriet Vanger, and expose the financial misdeeds of a prominent tycoon. I was much more taken with the Vanger mystery than with the story about corporate corruption. That was rather dry.

One of Larsson's larger objectives in this book is clearly to highlight the disturbing pervasiveness of violence against women. All of the significant violence in the book is gendered, and is perpetrated against female victims. One of its victims is co-protagonist Lisbeth Salander. She is certainly an interesting character, one who is uncomfortable with what many of us might consider basic sociability. She is also a woman who has endured much abuse, and that makes her essential to Larsson's larger point. One of Salander's most significant problems is that legally she is considered a ward of the state. She had been in this position as a child without competent parents, but her status as a legal dependent was allowed to continue into her adulthood. The fact that an adult who earns her own money, holds a job, and is capable of managing the basic elements of day-to-day life can be legally alienated from her money and her basic legal rights is, quite simply, frightening. Clearly Larsson is making an argument against the institution of guardianship. I was unclear if the portion of the text which explain guardianship were part of Larsson's original text, or if they were added by the translator for the non-Swedish audience.

This is not the most amazing book I've ever read, but it's a book I'll certainly think about for some time. I suspect I'll read the next two books in the trilogy, as long as I can stomach the violence. Larsson does not glorify the horrific violence about which he writes, but it is, undeniably, difficult to read.",3,"[-1.9990795786583067, -1.0113772356358046, -1.3331882044210415, -0.9782005138430616, -1.108513632727334]",-0.9782005138430616

380,"I really liked this story!

Though parts of it didn't feel totally accurate--smaller details, mostly; overall it was fairly plausible historical fiction--the story was entertaining and the characters extremely likable. And though I shuddered slightly when Gabriella was hanging out with spiders and beetles (spiders! and beetles!) it was really easy to adore her character anyway. And Raphe...ah, Raphe. You've got to love a guy who's been taking care of his younger sisters since the age of eight and somehow managed to educate all three of them himself. (One of the aforementioned details--where on earth would they get books as penniless, parentless kids living in St. Giles? But still, it's hard not to love characters who get excited by libraries and bookstores, so I'll go with it :))

Also very interesting to note that though there's chemistry galore here and all kinds of lusting after each other, actual sexytimes are sparse. I actually didn't miss it--it was nice to focus on the relationship for a change...plus, chemistry and lust and hot and heavy dreams filled in the gap nicely ;)

Raphe's younger sister Amelia is clearly being set up as the heroine of the next book, and I am so there, people! Can't wait!

But Emma being as young as she was and Anthony being spoiled and emotionally immature for his age caused insecurities, accusations to surface thus straining their connection. At points I really thought Anthony was an a$$ and used a good dose of double standard towards Emma. At the end he somewhat redeemed himself but used up all of his brownie points in my eyes.

500,"Let me start by saying that I generally love historical mysteries. They intrigue me and educate me about a time and place that I am not familiar with. I was looking forward to C.J. Sansom's ""Dissolution"", a mystery that takes place in a monastery during the English Reformation. However, the setting proved to be not my cup of tea. That being said, the book definitely has redeeming qualities.

C.J. Sansom has definitely researched this time period well, and his concluding historical note clarifies many of the points made in his book. It all begins in November 1537 when Dr. Matthew Shardlake, a lawyer working for Lord Thomas Cromwell in London, is asked to go to the Monastery of St. Donatus in southern England. One of Cromwell's commissioners, Robin Singleton, had been down there trying to negotiate the monks' surrender to Henry VIII. However, Singleton was found beheaded, and it is up to Shardlake and his assistant, Mark Poer, to discover who committed the heinous crime.

On the first night of their stay, another tragedy unfolds when a young novice, Simon Whelpy, becomes ill and dies a day later. The infirmist suspects poisoning, and the fact that Whelpy died before telling Shardlake about another possible murder leads Matthew to suspect that more is going on. Stories begin to circulate about a young woman working at the monastery who went missing a few years earlier, and there is the matter of the church being desecrated and a precious relic stolen.

It seems that the longer Shardlake stays, the more complex the mystery gets. What is truth and what is being made up to continue a way of life that may not be in the best interests of society? How much of the terror in London is real and how much was Cromwell's creation? Whom can Shardlake trust?

The book was interesting, and it definitely picked up toward the end. However, I can't give it five stars. Perhaps this is my own fault, as I learned that Tudor England doesn't interest me as much as I thought it did. C.J. Sansom wrote an intriguing novel, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.",2,"[-2.5881855243232845, -1.9722499066543806, -1.755905582223403, -0.9786975958410575, -1.0359561291487152]",-0.9786975958410575

Indeed one can understand why the US is losing this war and why it may never have really been winnable in the first place.

Let me explain the four stars though before going further. Though the writing was excellent and I felt that I was almost there in the dusty valleys of Afghanistan, there was something missing, some connection between the large scales and the small scales. There is a fair amount of effort expended in the book to make those connections, but they weren't always successful. I found myself looking at maps and photo essays (not included in the book) that I found online to really understand the text. I honestly think this would be a better book with a bunch of large and small scale maps, photos of the terrain, and shots of just what the villages look like. Failing that, and it would be a very different book with those additions, do read this alongside your computer so you can look up those photos and those maps. Most every location cited in the book brings up a huge batch of images with a quick online search.

With that out of the way, let me praise Junger's writing. There's an empathy with the soldiers with which he's traveling that is quite obvious (ignore the reviews that harp about liberals traveling around with the troops, there's no fawning here, but there's never a hint of either condemnation or condescension here) but the hard, factual story is also on the page.

jennifers review

The Lie weaves a suspenseful tale about Emmanow going by the name Janewhose horrific experience while on vacation in Nepal has come back to haunt her five years later.

The story goes back and forth between current-day Jane and past Emma. Although it took me a few chapters to figure out that Jane and Emma were the same person, I came to an appreciation of the way the story was told. If I hadnt seen what Emma went through first-hand, it might not have been so moving.

My only complaint is that both the past and the present were written in present tense. That didn't make much sense to me. If its the past, why not use past tense? It would have been less confusing to get into the story.

Once I got into the rhythm of the story and past my confusion, I was completely immersed in Jane/Emmas tale. The suspense and action were a big part of what grabbed me, but I think the best aspect of The Lie is the rich characterization. Every character had their own secrets, motives, and psychological issues. This is a book where you either love or hate the characters, but you don't know who can be trusted.

The story is fast-paced, but the author doesnt neglect setting or character descriptions. I felt like I could see everything that Emma saw.

At times I felt that Janes story was a disruption. I wanted to get back to what was happening in Nepal. That might just be me, though, because Jane was certainly in danger in the present day. Its not like her peril was less interesting or less concerning. I did like that the reader is kept guessing about who might be after Jane. Still, I was worried about Emma and needed to get back to see what was happening to her and her friends.

Overall, I really enjoyed reading The Lie. I think it would appeal to many readers, especially those who like stories of betrayal and deceit. I give The Lie four and a half stars. It would have been five stars if it weren't for the rough start.",3,"[-1.2298907492252409, -0.979275987596314, -1.1503814822462104, -0.9986465236806836, -1.544498583912143]",-0.979275987596314

9547,"This movie is one of those that I wasn't really sure I wanted to watch.  I like sports-centric inspirational kind of movies but I was a bit concerned that this might be a bit too preachy for my tastes.  But in reality the message has been toned down to the point so that it really doesnt try to push the concept of faith down your throat.  This movie is in the vein of other similar style of football movies but isn't quite as flashy as those and maybe not as strong overall but I really like the message that it tries to convey that sports is not the most important thing in life and whether you win or lose isn't what you will be remembered for but how you handle those situations in life.  Although this isn't my favorite football/sports type movie, the story is well done and based on real events and has a good message.

2933,"I do not ordinarily feel the need to review Stephen King books, nor do I customarily get around to reading them until they hit the remaindered tables a couple of years after being published, but when 11/22/63 came out I knew I had to read it right away.  As with most Americans of a certain age I have vivid memories of November 22, 1963 (I was six, by the way)and the terrible days that followed President Kennedy's assassination.  Before, during and now after  my career as a high school history teacher I frequently fantasized about a time machine, a  way to return to the past to observe and perhaps change pivotal events.  I've read a number of wonderful books about time travel, and I have to rate King's newest effort among the best of them.

Jake is a high school English teacher in Maine in 2011.  Essentially rootless and feeling adrift, he learns of and is deeply touched by stories of old tragedies affecting people he knows.  Then he meets Al, a man with a secret: access to 1958 through a wormhole or bubble.  He makes a few trips back into time, eventually making efforts to prevent some of the local tragedies with which he is familiar.  Then Al assigns him another task: return to 1958 and spend the next five years working to prevent JFK's assassination.  Jake accepts the challenge, but he finds unexpected twists and turns that complicate an already difficult job.

King's depictions of the modern world and that of the late 50s and early 60s are fascinating and colorful.  The suspense is never ending and immeasurably enhanced by the vast amount of research he undertook to ensure historical accuracy.  I was riveted all the way through and intend to reread this many times.",4,"[-1.1534478749898132, -1.1606226360530292, -1.7205909616227786, -0.9793271392344083, -0.9860402726668358]",-0.9793271392344083

5977,"I love Captain Lacey and the manner in which he goes about his life.  Now that he's married to the lovely Donata, I enjoy the books even more because he doesn't have to be so concerned about some of the smaller things in life.  He's worthy of having a few servants, great home cooked meals and a sweet and lovely wife.  He's also deserving of being able to spend time with his daughter with whom he had lost touch with so many years previously and then was able to locate through the help of his erstwhile helpful foe, Mr. Denis.

Yep, things are looking up for Lacey, although I must confess the mystery in this book was a particularly difficult one to read about since it dealt with the Derwent family and some horrendous happenings that touched their lives.  Without giving anything away, one character from past books is murdered, another one beaten and the nice Derwent family undergoes quite a bit of misery.

In the end, Captain Lacey solves the mystery and we get to see a bit of Mr. Denis and his cronies as well as a fair amount of Grenville and Marianne - hopefully that relationship makes some satisfactory progress in future books.  We did have a bit of progress in this one.  I must confess that Grenville is a favorite character and I love reading about him.

I give this book four stars for the writing and the fact the book held my interest, but personally the topic of this book was difficult for me to enjoy.  I read these books for relaxation and this one didn't quite do it for me.

2922,"""Vampire Academy"" is the second novel written by Seattle-based Richelle Mead.  This time, she takes us back to school--vampire school, to be exact.

The story begins when Vasilissa Dragomir and Rose Hathaway are apprehended by the Vampire Academy's truant squad and returned to school after a runaway attempt.  Lissa, who is a Moroi and a true vampire, is one of the Royals who is close to the vampire throne. Rose, who is a dhampir, is destined to protect her.  Moreover, Rose is bound to Lissa's mind in a way no guardian has been since the days of the saints.  Lissa has a talent that frightened them both into getting away from the school.

Of course, things are different when they return and the once-popular duo are the subject of rumors and character assassination.  Typical high school stuff, only lives are at stake.

""Vampire Academy"" was a great read.  Mead's idea of vampires is slightly different than what I am acquainted with, but she did a great job of explaining how  dhampirs, Morois, and Strigois differ.  Her world and rules were very good, for the most part.  Her characters were people that you wanted to care about and read more about.  My one complaint was that Ms. Mead did not set the scene as well as she did in her first book, ""Succubus Blues.""

Because of this, and in order to save his daughter Amelia, Callum had to undergo a blackmail from a moneylender, and in the next few months he would have to steal several jewels from people of society until he paid off all of his cousin Robert's debt.
Without having the money to pay, Callum obeyed. And soon he became known as the Surrey Bandit.
The last item on the list to be stolen was the famous brooch of Dowager Duchess of Penworth. And at this meeting, Callum and Alice Worthingham come face-to-face.

Alice's family was neighbor of the Viscount Arndel, and although she found him the most handsome man she had ever met, he did not seem to be charmed by her last season. In fact, he looked at her like she had pox!! So she decided that although he and she were meeting quite a bit, because Callum was selling part of his land to the new Duke, Alice's brother, she would rather marry someone away from Surrey.

But the big question was, would Callum this time let Alice be courted by other men?
It was certain that he was poor and could not woo a duke's daughter/sister, but the feeling he had for her was greater than reason, and soon Callum found himself doing craziness to be able to have Alice.
However clever as it was, since the Worthingham sisters were raised quite differently from the other ladies in society, Alice discovers Callum's secret... and now, she would have to choose between handing him over to the police to be hanged or hear her heart...

7018,"There is no doubt that Orwell became a great writer.  And this book (along with ""Burmese Days"") may have provided the first indications of his brilliance.  However, unlike some of his other works, this one has not passed the test of time.  While his writing is good, the book has become somewhat dated; it is locked into the world as it was nearly 100 years ago, and it consequently is less relevant and shocking than one might expect, particuarly given what we've come to expect from Orwell.  His descriptions of what poverty was like in Paris and London do not paint a happy picture, but they pale in comparison to some more modern works -- Barbara Ehrenreich's ""Nickled and Dimed"", to mention just one.

What is mosts sad and distressing about the book is that despite the passage of so many years, and despite our belief that we've become a kinder, gentler society, not much has changed when it comes to poverty and how we treat the poor.  And, of course, there was nothing that Orwell could do about that -- though he certainly seems to have been able to predict the future in his most famous works.",2,"[-2.3663696685445856, -1.4811771229195085, -1.3829872791559388, -0.9808782326413086, -1.6335828931404075]",-0.9808782326413086

711,"The second in Shaara's planned trilogy about the western battles in the Civil War.  The focus of this book is on the siege of Vicksburg, Mississippi, a battle that established the reputation of Ulysses Grant and his later promotion to  commander of the entire union army.  Shaara uses the same format as he has done in his other books: that is, a great deal of research and the use of characters, both fictional and real.  In relating the stories he sets up both conversations and interactions between the main individuals which have the ring of being possibly those that actually took place at the time.  The reader's interest is captured by the feeling that he or she is reading a well done novel with the understanding that facts presented are those that actually took place at the time of the book.
  General Grant looked at the capture of Vicksburg as a military necessity in order to disrupt the supply line for the Confederacy and achieve control of the Mississippi river. At a great cost in casualties he crossed the Mississippi and drew a line at the city.  Due to the heavy casualties suffered by his army he elected to lay siege to Vicksburg rather than attempt to take it by frontal attacks.  Shaara uses both Grant and General William Sherman as key commanders directing the siege, and Bauer, a private that was used in his book Blaze of Glory previously to depict the human side of the conflict.  The Confederate side uses both Generals John Pemberton who commanded the men defending Vicksburg and Joseph Johnston who chose not to come to the aid of the troops under Pemberton, but remained in Tennessee indicating that the siege of Vicksburg was nothing but minor skirmishes between the armies.  There is also the use of a civilian living in Vicksburg, Lucy Spence who was an actual person, and distinguished herself by volunteering as a nurse at a hospital ministering to the Confederate wounded. Shaara's description of the conditions experienced during the siege by both military and civilians is excellent.  The lack of food, bare essentials,  medical supplies and the consequences of these shortages are well described and allow the reader to envision what the participants felt and suffered through until the capitulation by Pemberton brings relief.
  The book is ideal for any reader interested in Civil War history, but actually anyone that would like to immerse themselves in an excellent novel with the knowledge that it is based on fact.",4,"[-3.5378758208139036, -1.90421497731165, -1.162039288706298, -0.9809320626521627, -1.0917108076379376]",-0.9809320626521627

5418,"Lis Wiehl with April Henry in their new book, Lethal Beauty Book Three in the Mia Quinn Mystery series published by Thomas Nelson gives us another adventure with Mia Quinn.

From the inside jacket flap:  It should have been an open and shut murder case, but Mia Quinn finds out nothing about it is simple.

After a young Chinese prostitute is stabbed to death by her rich American client, the tabloids dub Dandan Yee Lethal Beautydespite the fact that she was the one who ended up dead. Yet even with double standards and naked prejudice working against her, Seattle prosecutor Mia Quinn is determined to get justice for Dandan Yee.

But when a key witness goes missing and an unsavory juror shuts down deliberations without explanation, Mia fears the trialand the laware being tampered with.

A constellation of fresh killings has Mia and homicide detective Charlie Carlson searching for a common source and puts Mias family in the crosshairs of a Chinese crime cabal. Meanwhile, Dandan Yees mother has opted to take matters into her own hands . . . and the stakes get more lethal overnight.

In the midst of all this, Mia has to contend with a fifteen-year-old son who is growing up too fast for his own good, and the idea that Charlie might want to be more than just friends. Can Mia and Charlie stop the murders and still keep her family safe? Or is the very act of seeking justice enough to cost her everythingand everyoneshe loves?

The team of Wiehl and Henry is unbeatable. The quality of story that they produce is exceptional. This time around Mia is dealing with illegal immigration or human trafficking. The people are being brought here with the lure of a better life only to find themselves in prostitution. Mia now has to deal with the murders of these illegal immigrants and trouble at home. Lethal Beauty is an excellent murder mystery filled with marvelous characters, great plot twists, suspense and thrills.  This is an exciting book, extremely well paced and suspenseful.  I am enjoying this series and I hope there will be a next book in this series.

2784,"When I finished The Sting of the Drone last night, I knew a lot about the technology of drones and the moral dilemma they pose, but not a lot about the characters in the novel. With that said, the insights into the political realm of terrorism and counter-terrorism that were logically presented give so much food for thought, that this book will remain with me for some time.

Is it more moral for a pilot of an attack aircraft to actually be in danger when delivering a killing attack than to be in front of a screen and manipulating the craft as if it were a video game? And, does this extra layer of separation serve as insulation from the reality of death? Further, are all the terrorists who deliver death so randomly to the free world behaving because of a religious conviction, misguided though it is, or are some simply hired guns who do it for the money? Certainly seems likely.

The Sting of the Drone raises so many questions that it is easy to forgive the somewhat impersonal portrayals of the characters.",3,"[-1.2016753281343142, -1.2437703614198146, -1.2394523536850843, -0.9812493071164546, -1.3481440607177733]",-0.9812493071164546

Nevertheless, the story is a good one with great twists and turns.  At first, the story seems to give away too much, rarely referring to the early characters without mentioning that one will die soon and another will kill soon.  Intriguingly, these turn out to be both the least and the most important things about these characters.  At the end, the killer tells the father of the boy he killed that he wants him to understand ...I was a normal human being two months ago....Perfectly normal, I'd just like to say that.  The killer was a man of purpose in a highly respected position and, like so many in that exclusive world, never expected to be forced to confront and pay for his crimes and can't quite accept that others think he should be.

3001,"I am very much a mood reader. My enjoyment of a particular type of story can depend so much on if my mood is suited to it. In the case of A Marriage in Middlebury, I was in the mood for something light and frothy, yet as fragrant as the teas that Charlotte serves in her tearoom, and Anita Higman definitely delivers.

Charlotte Rose Hills tearoom is at the heart of Middlebury. Her gift of blending teas for specific people as well as making them feel at home in her establishment set the tone of the novel, really contributing to the small-town charm of Middlebury.

I really enjoyed the cast of characters in the story. Some were quirky, some were sweet and they all had a story to tell. These characters were flawed but remained endearing. I usually don't care for novels with lots of secondary characters, but their sub-plots became more engrossing to me than even Charlottes story  perhaps because I secretly believed there would be a happily-ever-after for her, and I wasn't disappointed!

Though this didn't replace Winter in Full Bloom as my favorite Higman novel, it was a delightfully fun read. I recommend for readers looking for a happily-ever-after featuring a cast of varied and quirky characters.

73,"Mary Shelly's Frankenstein is a classic in the horror genre. Contrary to the numerous subsequent portrayals in film, the original story presents a very different perspective. Rather than a castle laboratory with a mad professor persona along with a hump-backed assistant, Shelley's original tale is of a college student who dabbles in his dorm room and creates the creature. What follows is the creature's actions that span gentile acquisition of language skills to brutal murders arising from his frustration with humanity fearful of his appearance. He haunts and stalks Victor Frankenstein and murders his close friends and loves in an attempt to force V Frankenstein to make him a female companion.

The story is related a series of stories within stories as much of the tale is told by V Frankenstein to the captain of a ship that picks him up while stuck in ice. Victor as been in pursuit of the monster in an effort to destroy him. Within this story is the monster's tale related to Victor of his doings, including his education, which is fairly advanced as he's struggled and failed to insert himself into society. Much of the narrative is spent with V Frankenstein ruminating on his failure with life in general and his role in causing the deaths of so many people around him. Throughout much of the tale, the perspective leads to the possibility that there may be no monster and that all of the events have been perpetrated by a deranged mind of a normal human.",3,"[-3.2378847559352666, -1.6515231937938477, -0.9849814831051632, -0.9818414177717186, -1.2753940967777742]",-0.9818414177717186

Isaiah lives in East Long Beach.  The neighborhood is filled with crime and Isaiah uses his intelligence to help solve cases and problems in his neighborhood.  He charges whatever his clients can afford.

The story unfolds in two time periods 2005 and 2013.  As IQ works on a current case involving a rapper, we learn of how he became what he is today from the backstory of 2005.  How the loss of beloved brother guides him.  How he tries to be the person his brother would have wanted him to be.

The story is gritty, believable and fascinating.  Watching IQ methodically solve the case, while faced with his current surroundings.

 This one caught my eye because of the time period it was written in. I enjoy reading about the Revolutionary and Civil Wars, and Woodhouse did a great job on weaving a fictional tale and fictional characters with historical events and people. I really liked her two main characters, and their dangerous spy mission was as good and suspenseful as a suspense novel. I have read books before where a main character was a spy, but I think this is the first book I have read where both main characters were spies.

  It is interesting to see how different authors portray real historical people, and I enjoyed this author's portrayal of George Washington and Benjamin Franklin.

  I enjoyed the book a lot, and only wished it had been a little longer. It ended way too soon. Even though it was historical fiction, the story helped remind me of the sacrifices that were made to win our freedom and to keep it.

This book would be a good read even for people who have not read all the previous books in the series (though you definitely should read them all!) because it is more about the case than about Madriani.

I do have to agree with another reviewer that it is (I sincerely hope) unlikely that the dead language of amended clauses in the Constitution could get people angry enough to riot in the streets, much less be a motive for murder, but given the right social/political atmosphere it is plausible.  And I've read books that require a greater suspension of belief so this one didn't bother me too much.

The suspense in this book comes from the investigation, trial preparation, and courtroom action, not from dodging bullets or being chased by the real killer.  Madriani and Hinds have an unsympathetic client with strong circumstantial evidence and overwhelming public opinion pointing to his guilt.  And their opponent is as good at playing the courtroom game as they are.  They have an alternate theory of why the victim was killed but difficulty finding admissible evidence to prove it.  I found this process captivating but readers who want a stronger adrenaline fix might not enjoy it as much.

The writing is excellent and Martini throws in little tidbits about even the minor characters that make them stand out -- his description of ""The Tush"" in action made me chuckle.

She manages everything, including her brother, the Duke of Ravenwood's home. She can foresee pretty much any possibility and leaves nothing to chance. One would almost think she was prescient, but no, just highly organized with a gift for memorization utilizing word association.

When Amelia realizes she must find a husband, she decides she will use Viscount Sheffield's Annual Christmas Ball to get every eligible man of interest under one roof, in order to take her pick. When her brother informs her the ball is to be cancelled due to the orchestra stage being struck by lightning, Amelia decides she must step up to the plate and assist Viscount Sheffield find another venue for the ball.

What we have, however, in Viscount Sheffield is a man who has his own way of administrating his life and is very highly organized, yet manages to leave time out for fun - business takes place from 8:00 in the morning to 8:00 in the evening. Then, pleasure begins for the ensuing 12 hours and never the twain shall meet. In other words, business isn't mixed with pleasure and nothing ever mixes up his routine.

My mom particularly likes these containers because it's not hard for her to open.  She has arthritis, and it helps that she can easy open and close this container without any hard pulling motions, like on Tupperwares.  The container maintains a good tight seal, and looks quite nice to boot.

For those who are curious, this container is pretty much the exact same thing as the OXO Pet Pop, with exception of the tapered container and circular button on top.  I contacted OXO to see what the difference was between the two items, and was notified that they work exactly the same, so if you're looking for a slightly cheaper version of this container, you may want to consider the Pet Pops.  If you're thinking of storing coffee, the coffee pop is the same, except the container is tinted so your coffee won't oxidize as quickly.  I've included a photo with all the Pops below.

Overall, I'm very pleased with the Oxo Pop line - they're durable, easy to clean, and definitely a breeze to open.",4,"[-1.8273305407695601, -1.1265363314720558, -1.8644439834242328, -0.9834474442387919, -1.0327171739235659]",-0.9834474442387919

The cutesy cover of her first book in this series, Loose Screw, got me interested, but it was the first class mystery that kept me hooked until I clicked the last page on my Kindle.

Lucy Matthews is a crime reporter turned antiques dealer, who one day stumbles across a body. When her ex-boss asks her to follow up the murder for a story she reluctantly agrees and ends up knee-deep in a murder investigation.

This was a really fun mystery. I could completely relate to Lucy in her love for her pets and the way they boss her around. I live in a family of two cats and one hamster and even the hamster knows I'm a pushover.

The mystery felt well plotted out and I really enjoyed the combination of Lucy and Detective Blake. I sure hope there is more romance between the two of them in later books in the series.

The movie occasionally silly with some goofy moments, especially in the end involving a plane and a motorcycle. Despite that though the film is always entertaining. Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Watchmen, Supernatural seasons 1-2) probably would have made a better Hannibal than Liam Neeson in the upcoming A-Team movie and he shows why in the Losers by shining in a similar role.

I also liked Chris Evans and I think he was surprisingly better here in a cocky and talkative role than he was in the Fantastic Four movies. He's more entertaining in the Losers than he was in those 2 movies as well. I still don't see him as Captain America though, due to that character being less cocky and goofy than anyone Evans has played. Jason Patric is also in good form as the nutty wisecracking villain.

My only problem with the Losers is that should have ended the story with one movie. It's a good movie, but I don't see sequels happening, especially due to the not so great Box Office performance. But I recommend checking out the Losers since I enjoyed it more than the new Nightmare on Elm Street, hell even a little more than Iron Man 2.

58,"In a previous review I had wished Cornwall would mix up the formula of his Sharpe series, proving the French proverb correct--I didn't at all enjoy getting what I wished for. Sharpe's Trafalgar is a hybrid novel of unlikely Romance and unlikely happenstance adventure wherein we are asked to suspend our disbelief that an army officer just happens to stumble upon the greatest naval battle since Actium.  I did so grudgingly.  After all can't Cornwall come up with his own interesting premises to drive a plot--or will we have Sharpe ricocheting across Europe in the Napoleonic Wars.

Not only does our hero stumble into the battle  at Trafalgar but he is introduced to Nelson who (naturally) takes a shine to Sharpe offering sage advice about being unnecessarily modest.  Sadly, this is the plausible part of our tale with a seedy and wholly unconvincing affair between a baroness and the ensign taking center stage.  Apparently aristocrats in the 19th century risked all--wealth, status and comfort for a roll in the hay. Why?  They are bored. And realize how disagreeable an arranged marriage can be.

Even if one assumes the Lady Grace is indifferent to class mores and proprieties, are we supposed to believe she is too horny to restrain herself in a venue that all but ensures discovery. Does it bother her 19th century sensibilities that she is an adulterous? Of course not. That her lover commits murder to silence blackmail?  Whatever.  It is all too absurd for words.  Cornwall's strength was never character development but surely an editor could have pointed out that 21st century morality is inappropriate in a story taking place 200 years ago.  I have no doubt adultery happened. I also have no doubt it didn't happen as described in ST.

What saves this from being a silly stinker is the genuinely interesting description of 19th century naval tactics and life above and below deck.  The battle of Trafalgar is rousing and the devotion Nelson inspires is well done. However, Cornwall seems to have ventured into the realm of romance with this one, and that isn't, in my opinion, a good thing.",2,"[-2.0495158047749964, -0.9840278345419476, -1.52622068515002, -1.0025670605843717, -1.1785836414407427]",-0.9840278345419476

Not being a fan of Apple products per se, although I do like my I-pod, I watched this movie more out of curiosity than as a fan of the company or the man.  The movie provided an interesting insight to the life of Steve Jobs and the company itself, in some ways similar to the rise of Bill Gates.  I found it interesting that both men rose to prominence off the ideas of others in reality.  I am not normally an Ashton Kutcher fan but I found that his portrayal of Jobs was very well done, even emulating his walk and mannerisms very well.  The story itself is ok but I felt tended to stay away from the more complex issues of Jobs life and only highlighting some of them.  Maybe this would have made the story too long, I don't know, and may have been better suited as a mini-series in order to tell the full story as opposed to made for the big screen movie.  With Jobs now gone, it remains to be seen that the company will continue on with the passion that Jobs brought when he ran the company.  A chapter that is yet to be written.

2135,"I have loved all of Suzanne Woods Fisher's books, so was not surprised in the least , that this new one had everything that I believe a great novel should have! ""The Newcomer"" is the second in a series of three, entitled ""Amish Beginnings"". It is fabulous sequel to ""Anna's Crossings"", book one.

The setting was described in such a realistic, detailed way , that I felt that I was living in this strange land, speaking a language very different from most other residents. The time frame of the 1700's was fitting for the newcomers. The rules and laws seem to be very different from what they are used to, making them fearful of what will happen next.

The characters are practical people who strive to make new lives for themselves under the most difficult circumstances. At once, I was able to identify with their problems, challenges and fears. Their uncertainty in this new land was felt deeply within as they encountered problems that seemed insurmountable. Losing their leader unexpectedly , was an experience that threw them into a complete panic. One of my favorite characters was a young lad named Felix,  a most adventuresome boy, who constantly seemed to find trouble, while at the same time , discovered important and valuable information. All of the characters were described in such detail that they became my friends, as I walked alongside them in their rocky journey.

Although I am not a great fan of historical fiction, Suzanne writes in such a way that I learn as I enjoy the plot. There are constantly unexpected twists and turns that keep the reader engaged from beginning to end of the novel. The plot progresses steadily and quickly. I must say, that I NEVER was prepared for the next bump in the road as these immigrants fought to find a home in this strange, new country.

This author has never failed in writing a book that amazes me! She keeps a reader totally enthralled from beginning to end of the book.

Definitely a five star book! I am impatiently waiting for the concluding book in this series!

1114,"I read Bill Bryson's ""A Walk in the Woods"" and laughed so hard I was crying.  I was expecting the same with ""The Thunderbolt Kid"".  However, this is more a reminiscence of life in the Midwest in the 1950's.  There were a few funny moments in this book but not nearly as many as a ""A Walk in the Woods"".

If you are a baby boomer and enjoy reading about growing up in that era, then this book will appeal.  There are things here that all of us can enjoy if you are like me, a child of the 1950's.

The author uses the book as a tool for rants against the United States in some of the last chapters.  He particularly has great unhappiness with Republicans, the CIA, and Nixon among others.

However, if you like to read about the past and remember some of the good times of the era  then this is a fun book; it is just not as laugh out loud funny as ""A Walk in the Woods"". I did enjoy catching up with Bill Bryson's old friend, Stephen Katz, who accompanied him on his walk in the wood on the Applachian Trail.

This was a cute friends to lovers story with a twist. The characters meet in college and become best friends. I loved their friendship with one another. Their banter back and forth was effortless and you could really feel the friendship/ love they had for one another. As the years progress they both start to have stronger feelings for one another but both are afraid to admit it for different reasons.

One deal and one night later changes everything for both of these characters and circumstances take them away from one another for an extended period of time. However when they reconnect their friendship will be put to the test and secrets will be revealed.

I liked the realness of this story, it wasn't rushed. It wasn't insta love. They met and formed a true friendship over years and I felt they both knew one another really well. When things transpire and secrets came out later I felt like the characters were able to be adults and handle the situation as such. I thought the storyline was good, I felt the characters were real and they were very funny at times. This was a really great read that I enjoyed right from the start all the way through to the end.

Americans in Moscow learn of a Soviet spy school that supposedly trains future Soviet agents to talk, act, look and think like Americans. Part of the teaching staff is made up of American MIA fliers shot down over North Vietnam in the 1960s and whisked off to Moscow to form the instructor cadre for the charm school. The plot delves into the human psyche of the common Russian citizen, the treacherous KGB agents, and even the low-life Soviet farmer and the poor.
Nelson DeMille has done his research well. Someone once said what makes for good writing is a believable plot, interesting characters, realistic dialogue, suspense, mystery, romance, the battle between good and evil, and sometimes a happy ending. DeMille has captured every single one of the above to produce one of the finest novels I have read in years. It holds even more meaning for me now (2014) in that the new president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, is attempting to return Russia back to those evil, surreptitiousness and deceitful ways of the old Soviet Society.
The novel grabs the reader in the first chapter and doesnt let go until the very last page. I give this novel my very highest rating. It will keep you up late at night.

One of my problems with it was in how heavily the author carried her knowledge of the period, determined to impress us with how much she knew.

M.J. Carter has no such problem.

In sparkling prose she exposes us to early 19th century India, the ""Raj"", and a whole host of historical personages without our even noticing it.

Plus, she tells a bone-shakingly good mystery story!

Early reviews compare this to, among others, John Masters, Arthur Conan Doyle, Wilkie Collins, and others.

The one author no one has yet mentioned is, of course, the most obvious; perhaps BECAUSE it is the most obvious.

In William Avery and Jeremiah Blake Ms. Carter has created two memorable characters to rival the most interesting of Kipling's

Milne (The Red House Mystery)
A.A. Milne is, of course, best remembered for his series of Winnie the Pooh tales.  In addition, he wrote for the famous British humor magazine Punch, was a fine playwright and, though he served in WWI, became an outspoken pacifist.  In the midst of all this, he wrote one of the classic English drawing room mysteries--The Red House Mystery.  The book ends on a note which seems to imply that further adventures will follow, but sadly none did.
The Red House is a British manor, home to Mark Ablett, and gathering place for his fun loving friends.  But the bucolic setting is disrupted when Ablett's long lost brother, black sheep of the family, is murdered and Mark goes missing.  Two guests, Antony Gillingham, a sort of Holmsian jack of all trades, and Bill Beverley, a mildly dense Watson-like sidekick, take it upon themselves to solve the crime.  What follows is a reasonably dated but still amusing ""intuitive"" mystery.  Raymond Chandler apparently went out of his way to attack the story as one of the worst examples of the genre, wholly lacking in genuine criminological methodology and requiring enormous intuitive leaps on the part of the ""detectives"".  Still, take it for what it is and it offers a pleasant enough reading experience.

I am familiar with Mr. Kreutzman, the drummer, and thought any memoir by a Dead band member has to be good.

This is a fun read with lots of interesting stories.

The Dead have traveled and given lots of concerts in some amazing places and there are lots of stories here.

Anyone with cats knows that they tend to throw up on occasion - they have to get those pesky hairballs up somehow. Anyway, we had reached a point where each of our two cats started to throw up every day and it was making our lives quite a bit busier because of the cleanup involved. The cats acted fine, but we were overworked with cleaning up pet messes.

After we decided it was time for a change, I did what I usually do - research the customer reviews to see what people had to say about the Blue Buffalo cat food (there are tons of varieties. I landed on this food and found that most reviews were really positive, with one actually saying his cats stopped throwing up all the time. That got me hook, line and sinker.

So, I'm here to report the same for my cats. We are now on our second bag of this variety of Blue Buffalo cat food (sensitive stomach). Amazingly, the throwing up stopped, except for the occassional hair ball incidents. I can't believe the positive effect this food has had for my cats. They are shiny, healthy looking, and best of all, they aren't throwing up everywhere anymore. We'll buy this food forever now.",4,"[-2.020363481367924, -1.2649897491240099, -1.4466442837748597, -0.986542246964625, -1.140454439264183]",-0.986542246964625
2921,"I was itching for a paranormal and saw that this movie was coming out for rent soon.  I am a read a book before seeing a movie type of gal so figured I would crack it open.  I was glad I did.  I was quickly transported into the world Ms. Mead created, quickly engrossed with the story line and lving the dynamic of Rose and Lissa.  The story starts off fast pace, not giving you a chance to be board with the details which is a smart move.  I was immediately invested in these two women and thus then wanted all the details the author could give.

This book is filled not just with action, but humor and moments of suspense.  I guessed a good portion of what was going on as to me it was rather out there.  Granted that didn't keep away the intrigue and mystery that were written in because the why was left to be discovered along the way as well as some of the who done it.

I loved that there is a world of good mortal vampires mixed in with those that we already know about, the evil immortal kind.  There seems to be some respect for the Dhampir and I was happy to see that as I read because I was rooting for Rose the whole time.  I liked that she is a kick butt girl but she is also a teen in high school so she is having fun too.  She is a blend of both mature and naive but the realities of her world quickly allow her to mature more.

104,"I can't resist saying this. This book was fun. It was also captivating in that once picked up, I couldn't put it down. I don't re tell story lines in my reviews, but when I found out that this read was an attempt to kidnap the British PM, Winston Churchill, I was hooked. I am a WWII buff of the war in Europe, so an attempt by the Germans to pull off such a ""heist"" was just too much to resist.
The book is touted by the author as having been well researched as a factual event, yet we are told that we must allow some literary license so as to give the story some flow when we read from the perspective of the antagonists who plotted the kidnapping. The story takes place in 1942, so it's fair to presume that some latitude had to be given when we are being told how the event is to be carried out by the German High Command.
I confess that there was some confusion with names in that some of the Germans had first names that could have been names by the allies. So, particularly at the end, I had to pay close attention as to who was talking, a German soldier or an Allied soldier.
The story has a great ending, which I cannot in good conscience divulge, but going along for the ride as the climax unravels, it is a great story unto itself.

Amy, who was prematurely unfrozen, is trying to come to terms with life aboard the ship and misses her family and being on Earth. When it looks like they might be closer to their destination than anyone thought, she becomes excited and will do anything to get off the ship. Meanwhile Elder tries to be the best leader he can be, but was he born to lead?

I absolutely loved the first book, Across the Universe. I seem to read a lot of YA fantasy but not a lot of YA science fiction and that's part of my strong affection for this series. The other part is that the idea of leaving earth in Godspeed for another planet, hopefully a better planet, is such a fantastic idea and I've loved watching this play out.

For me, A Million Suns was even better than the first book. Across the Universe  set up the story and it really developed into a fast-paced thrilling story in A Million Suns. Through Elder and Amy we learn more about the secrets behind Godspeed and some of the secrets were definitely edge-of-the-seat earth-shattering! There were quite a few ""Oh My"" moments as I read faster and faster to the thrilling end.

I liked Elder a little less in A Million Suns. He needs to stand up and be a leader and he has to make some tough decisions, but there was something that didn't quite connect with me.

9467,"Let me first say that I have NOT seen the original (which I know to some movie buffs is a travesty) but it means I am judging this film entirely on my experience of it, not comparing it to the original. And based on that, this was definitely a solid 4-star comedy for me. Russell Brand stars as Arthur, an alcoholic rich playboy whose mother (also CEO of the family firm) has had it with his behavior, and ordered him to marry an ambitious rising socialite (Jennifer Garner) to soothe investors' worries about succession. Helen Mirren plays his long-standing nanny, and the only one who gets him, while Greta Gerwig plays his love interest.

I felt Russell Brand and Helen Mirren were quite good. He was best in his scenes with her - she pulled a depth out of him, that brought a poignancy to even his comedic scenes with her. I also liked the chemistry between him and Greta Gerwig, although it took half the film for her to grow on me. Although I'm usually a fan of Jennifer Garner, I didn't like her in this role - she was too unlikable and not funny. Brand's scenes with her, as well as some of his slapsticky ones (such as when he works in a candy store for a bit) were the weak points for me. And I did have some discomfort with the comedic moments that were based on his character's alcoholism, although overall I thought the film handled this fine, with Brand attending AA etc., and cleaning himself up in the end (in other words, it toed the PC line, and I felt it didn't glorify drinking, as some reviewers have complained.)

Because of the subject matter, it's not a laugh-out-loud kind of humor most of the time - there is a poignancy to Arthur, and there are sad bits to this film (don't want to spoil it by telling too much.) In the end I was really rooting for Arthur though, and that's a tribute to Brand (and indirectly, Mirren.) So judged on its own, I think it's a worthy movie.",3,"[-3.897852885487989, -1.566492683590996, -1.1353016825065623, -0.9883472272238707, -1.3681366895313614]",-0.9883472272238707

In ""If You Lived Here, I'd Know Your Name"" (281 pages) author Heather Lende brings us everyday stories of what life is like in Haines, Alaska. There is no story line in the book, just observations of what life is like in a place that is reachable only by ferry or by plane (no McDonald's!). Surprise, but even in a close-knit community like that, it turns out that there is trouble in the high school (less than 100 kids in total) with kids being picked on etc. Hende writes the obituaries for the local weekly, and that allows her to get even closer to the people in the community, and it comes across in the book. Her love for Haines is obvious, and affectuous. It makes me want to visit the place myself.

Annie is a young Irish housekeeper when the Wonderful Wizard of Oz book was first released, and Annie finds herself very interested in this very popular book. She also loves reading the stories her father wrote for her before he passed away. The characters were very interesting, and I liked the relationship between Stephen Adams, the mail carrier, and Annie Gallagher.

I enjoyed reading this book and the characters that were within the pages. Although I did not read the first in the series, I was still able to read the story without any confusion. This was easy to follow, and it can definitely be read as a stand-alone book.

463,"Charles Cumming's spies are engaged in an endless game of lying.  All of them lie to everyone all the time, while they attempt to discern the lies in each other's statements.

Typhoon occurs in two sections, eight years apart.  In the first section Joe Lennox, a junior MI6 agent living in Hong Kong just before the handover of that city to China, tries to figure out why a Chinese defector whom he was the first to interview  subsequently disappeared.  Although his superiors in MI6 and colleagues in the CIA tell him that the defector was a plant, and was sent back to China, Joe believes they are all lying to him.

The second section of the story picks up 8 years later, when Joe is sent by MI6 to Shanghai to spy on his old CIA frenemy, Miles Coolidge.  Joe is pleased to do this because, among other things, Miles stole the Love of His (Joe's) Life, aided by some sneaky tricks.

As compared with his earlier novels, Cumming is here working with a larger canvas and at a greater distance from his characters.  His focus is politics within China and between China and the West, with emphasis on the dark side of the Chinese economic miracle and the utter pointlessness of the spy game.

The story is narrated, not by Joe Lennox, but by a journalist who works part time for MI6.  I think this distance dulled my concern for the characters, especially compared with Alex Milius, the hero of two other Cumming novels.  While Joe is a ""better"" person than Alex, I didn't get close enough to Joe to develop for him the affection I have for Alex.  And let's face it --  there's something ""off"" about a guy who still isn't over a former girlfriend after eight years.

As for the girlfriend, Isabella, being myself a woman who grew up after the '50s, I find her aimlessness annoying rather than endearing. She seems to have no interior life, no interests, and no goals.  Really, I thought Joe was well rid of her.

In sum, I always look forward to the next Charles Cumming novel, but I hope it is about Alex.",3,"[-1.7492636934516532, -1.0646533568297423, -1.1743718716880192, -0.9890406638890049, -1.8491781510481664]",-0.9890406638890049

Mia and Jay have been best friends since f-face broke Mia's heart. They do what all best friends do together. Talk about their day, share things with each other that you can't with others. Typical friendship. Then Mia gets  all these questions in her head and she needs to ask Jay. She really wants to know if he's attracted to her. What would happen if they had sex? Mia has had some pretty hot fantasies about Jay. Will there friendship hold if it goes horribly wrong?
Jay isn't sure what to think about what Mia has asked. He's always been attracted to her even when she was with f-face. But Jay has some serects that no one knows and he doesn't want to share, not even with Mia. He's scared that if she knows she will run and that will be the end. Even though in about 2 years he's leaving but he wants to have her in his life. So after they have been avoiding each other one gives in and boom, the heat between them is just explosive!

The top where you rest your feet is rubberized so your feet don't easily slide on it, and it is also textured to provide a bit of grip and/or give you a bit of a foot massage if you're using it without shoes.

1724,"When I saw this book was a zombie western romance, I was a little bit wary. I love zombies, but romance isn't my thing and I don't think I've ever read a western in my life. But I'm nothing if not adventurous, so I decided to give it a try, and I'm really glad that I did.

Told in alternating POVs of Red, a beautiful loner with a tragic past, and Trace (also known as Cowboy), who first encounters her in a wild west saloon, Wanted: Dead or Undead tells their story as they move through the country, looking for a safe haven from the zombie hordes. As their relationship moves from unwilling on Red's part, to friendship and finally love, picking up Wen and two children on their travels, Trace gradually discovers more about Red, and the secret she works so hard to hide.

I liked all the characters in this book, all are well drawn and likable, and it's impossible not to cheer for them as they make their way through some pretty hairy situations. And it's a very well written story - Angela Scott has a knack for making her words come alive on the page.

Probably my favourite part of the book, however, is Red and her secret. It's something I've seen only a few times before in zombie books and it's done exceedingly well here - but if you want to know more, you're going to have to read the book!

Although romance is really not big on my list of favourites, the romance between Trace and Red feels very natural and unforced - there's limited cheesiness and some pretty tender moments. I also enjoyed the Wild West setting - as I said earlier it's not something I've read before, but it does bring a whole new facet to zombie killing!

The crate was WERY easy to unfold and set up, the wires are strong and the 2 doors are most convenient. They allowed us to set it up in a such a way that one door was opens permanently against a regular, wooden dog house while the other door is the exit. This way, the 2 have a 2-room apartment with full privacy in the dog house while the crate serves as the dining room/living. It's working very well. I would call it a comfortable apartment.

Idris Elba inhabited the role of Nelson Mandela in a credible and impressive manner. He adopted the mannerisms and speech patterns, and made you forget that he wasn't the ""real deal"".

One of the most interesting things that I learned from the film is that he and Winnie essentially switched roles.

The film covers a very long time span, and in the process gives only a superficial coverage to the political and social upheaval of the time.

`The Devil's Backbone released in '01 is an intelligent, stylish and atmospheric film set in a remote orphanage in 1939 during the Spanish Civil War. The story revolves around a new arrival at the orphanage named Carlos who is assigned the bed of a missing student. When Carlos begins to hear unidentified sighs in the night he becomes determined to discover the whereabouts of the missing child.

Numerous characters are portrayed in various situations throughout this complicated novel. With murder, theft, deception and suspicious individuals throughout, no one is exempt from being suspect to any number of questionable incidents. This is a fast paced story that leaves no room for boredom.

I had a bit of difficulty keeping characters straight, particularly male characters. The plot was well told, although a bit disjointed at times which led to some confusion. I had to backtrack a bit to clarify those scenes. The suspense held my attention throughout. It's a good weekend suspense read.

1275,"If having a TON of pages dog-eared (or highlighted) is the mark of a great book, then Tell Me Three Things certainly qualifies. It's just the right level of intensity to be an enjoyable read, it's sweet and there are so many moments of witty dialogue. Centered around a seventeen year old named Jessie as she moves to a new state, becomes part of a new family dynamic, and joins a new school. She's grieving the loss of her mother, the loss of the house she grew up in, and missing her best friend.  That's ALOT for anyone, but these new circumstances are enough to leave the poor girl in a haze of angst.

Jessie Holmes is one of those characters that is likable from the get go. We are immediately plunged into Jessie's new reality and meet her anonymous email pal Somebody Nobody. I LOVE stories when they unfold through personal communications. I just seem to get the characters quicker and this story is filled with a great group of people Jessie is forced to interact with, most coming from her new school.

As to characters, Buxbaum provides us with the dismissive step-brother (Theo), the schools' ""mean girls"" (Crystal and Gem), the brooding and nerdy hot boy(Ethan), new friends Dri and Agnes, and of course Scarlett - the best friend left behind in Chicago. But the real star of the story Somebody Nobody ( who may or may not be one of the aforementioned characters).  Jessie's email and instant message conversations with ""SN"" are so telling and where the sweet and witty aspects really shine. I caught myself smiling at their banter. And yes, I googled Fermi Paradox.  With SN,  Jessie starts to feel not so alone. The big mystery is ""who is SN"" and we're left wondering IF and WHEN SN will come-forward. Its fun as Jessie tries to figure it out and makes some unexpected guesses.

I've read Julie's other books and both stayed with me long after I finished them. Each one is unique in character and story-line and I commend her range.

66,"Few today can equal Bernard Cornwell as a historical fiction writer, and this sixth in his Saxon Chronicles series is top form.

Uhtred of Bebbanburg is again the narrator who has reluctantly become dedicated to Alfred the Great's goal of unifying England. But now Alfred is on his deathbed and chaos threatens. The Danes are waiting the right opportunity to invade and their plans are abetted by treachery, lies and a rival claimant for the thrown.

Uhtred had previously sworn loyalty to the king's daughter, AEthelflaed, and assures Alfred he will fight for Wessex. Alfred seeks and ultimately achieves Uhtred's allegiance for his heir, Edward. But there is mistrust between the two and Edward's advisers create delays that threaten the regime and endanger its inhabitants.

As always, Uhtred becomes involved in a variety of adventures which enhance the pace of the novel. In one he falls into the clutches of a sorceress in the employ of his enemies and she predicts the fall of England. Uhtred turns that around by creating his own place of pilgrimage, complete with ""angels"" and predictions meant to draw the Danes into a misstep.

The primary function of historical fiction is to entertain. That does not demand adherence to fact, and Cornwell readily admits Uhtred is his invention and other characters and events have been used to suit his story. The important thing is they be convincing to the reader. Do Shakespeare's dramas adhere to fact? Of course not. But generations of readers have accepted them as such.

Cornwell can't be equaled when it comes to depicting the horror of the battlefield and there's plenty of blood and guts as well as bawdy humor and romance.",3,"[-2.9481824981757323, -1.008774320463183, -1.7778370828455468, -0.9912169139716934, -1.3585371196564067]",-0.9912169139716934

So much so, that it would probably be impossible for any but the most astute scholar to tell the difference between vintage Stout and ""upstart"" Goldsborough.

This is a quick, yet fascinating read with all the ingredients to make this an enjoyable time spent with friends among the Amish. By writing in the first person point of view with vivid imagery the reader is immediately immersed in the life of Sally as she travels to a town with a ridiculous name to help a young girl who has been emailing with her for some time. What she finds there is a surprise both to her and the reader, and it is not just the fact that it is a completely different culture than where she lives with her used-car-salesman father.  Just what was the motive of young Lizzie? This is one novel I hope there will be a sequel for, as there was a thread left untied.

679,"Back in December, I read Daniel Wilson's Robopocalypse, an enjoyable sci-fi disaster novel.  I was particularly excited when I read about his new novel, Amped.  The set-up intrigued me: in the very near future, many people with physical and neurological disabilities are ""amped.""  They have artificial implants which give them full functionality, and, in some cases, super-human abilities.  However, a social-political movement has arisen, giving the ""amps"" second-class status, stripping them of basic rights.

What I thought would be an interesting treatise on disability rights turned out to be a standard story in sci-fi, the ""supers"" versus ""normals"" story played out in X-Men, Heroes, and elsewhere.  Faced with segregation and persecution, a group of amps begins a revolution.  The hero, Owen Gray, whose father developed some of the amp technology, gets caught up in the rebellion.  As the rebellion spreads, Wilson never adequately conveys the scope or implications of the movement.  I wasn't convinced that the events of the book really had a broader impact on the nation.  By contrast, in Robopocalypse Wilson skillfully placed the characters' stories within the context of the world-wide events.

Amped wasn't a bad book.  I was disappointed that Wilson did not develop the problems related to amping.  The persecution on amps did not seem logical, especially since most amps were truly disabled people whose lives are improved by technology.  I know we see rare cases in which people with prosthetics may face societal resistance, such as Oscar Pistorius's struggle to be included in the Olympics.  But I don't see that expanding to full fledged persecution; even though some did not think he should have been allowed to race because of his mechanical advantage, no one was clamoring for his citizenship to be taken away or his human rights to be denied.",2,"[-1.461296731840319, -1.2968375376549497, -1.1475645701726114, -0.992291835196922, -1.2538597975514614]",-0.992291835196922

3122,"I never thought that I would rank any Nelson DeMille book just ""OK"", but here it is.  Evidently this was originally written in 1975 as his first stand- alone novel but it was not published until 2013 after a substantial rewrite.  Previously he had written six novels in the Joe Ryker series (1974-1975), none of which I have ever heard of or seen.  I was originally hooked on Mr. DeMille after reading ""Charm School"" (1989), a brilliant story that has always been one of my favorite books, and I have read most of his other novels since then.  So it was interesting for me to go back 40 years and see what his style and thoughts were as a budding author.

""The Quest"" is simply another story about the search for the Holy Grail, but it could have been about the search for any mythical relic.  The characters are somewhat shallow with minimal backstory supplied about them, leaving you guessing what their true motivations are.  The main female character professes to be religious yet is less than truthful and has affairs with two men whenever convenient for her. One of the male characters is an older war correspondent who has the crap scared out of him in Ethiopia (having come very close to dying at the hands of a psychopath) yet is willing to return to that same country knowing that meeting up with the same psycho is inevitable.  Not many people can wet themselves with fear and yet return to the scene of the crime.  Our main narrator, Frank Purcell, appears to be the first attempt at constructing the imperfect hero (John Corey) that Mr. DeMille portrays in future novels.  Frank is enjoyable but is only truly interested in a few basic needs.

The writing is a bit jumpy and uneven, most likely the result of trying to double the length of the original story (written 40 years ago in a much simpler style) by a rewrite using the advanced skills that he has developed with four decades of practice.  It's similar to comparing Stephen King's writing today with the original efforts he wrote under the pen name of Richard Bachman.  There is some good stuff here and there but it is lacking in cohesiveness.

There were two parts of the story that stood out to me: Connie and Sam's relationship and the interludes of Deliverance Dane's life. Sam was my favourite character. He was funny, sweet, and seemed to come to life. Deliverance seemed to come to life for me too. It was an interesting look at life in the 1690s, and the Salem witch trial in particular.

1) Vin Diezel talks much more in this movie; he has way more lines.

2) There are better special effects, and

3) Overall, it's a better plot.

Nevertheless:

1) There are still multiple gaps in the plot; though Dark Fury- The Chronicles of Riddick is the missing link between the two movies, there is very little information given about the Elementals and the mysterious religion of the Necromongers, thus leaving the audience in the dark.

2) Riddick, surprisingly, gets his butt kicked left and right in Pitch Black by the ""jock"" bounty hunter, but in Chronicles there is this transformation that takes place and he becomes next to invincible.

3) Another setback is in relation to the acting (or lack of it), which is just average, and at times below average.

England, 1817

David Worthington, Duke of Penrose is not happy with the American governess his new wards have arrived with. He especially dislikes his attraction to the insufferable woman, and is anxious for her replacement to arrive.

Meredith Chambers is thrilled when the Dowager Duchess Penrose hires her as her companion. Now she can stay with her beloved charges. But can she ignore how her heart thumps when the pompous duke gets close?

Two people determined to ignore each other despite the pull between them, and the sparks that fly when they're together.

My Thoughts:

This is a sometimes funny, touching and well written novella by Callie Hutton.

Merry comes to England from America as the governess of two young girls who have recently lost their previous governess to an illness that took her life.
After several years employed by the girls parents she becomes the one person left to them after the tragic deaths of both parents. They do however have a guardian and she accompanies the girls to his home only to have him decide she would not make a suitable governess for the girls.
Now she is likely unemployed until his mother steps in and hires her as her companion. What ensues is highjinks and a developing love from a man who has never nor feels he will ever feel such emotions.
This is a well thought out story with well developed characters in spite of the short novel length of this book.
I would give this book 4.5 of 5 stars for storyline and characterization and 3 of 5 flames for heat. Although there is only one sexually physical scene in this story it is quite heated.

Much to my surprise, it was quite good and even my parents (who dislike science fiction) enjoyed it! Gyllenhaal pulls off the lead role expertly.

9379,"I very much enjoyed this film, and though it was definitely on a par with Elizabeth The Golden Age, but with a very different focus.
The narrative traces Elizabeth's imprisonment by her sister Mary, Mary's death and her enthronement, through her tempestuous relationship with Robert Dudley (played consummately by Tom Hardy, portrayed as a very self-centered and arrogant man) and the emergence of Mary Queen of Scots as a rival, though unlike The Golden Age, where Mary plays a large role, in this version she is never actually shown, only discussed. A lot of the events are portrayed in discussion or letters as is the death of Dudley and the defeat of the Spanish Armada, though a stirring recreation of Elizabeth's speech to the troops at Tilbury is a highlight of the film. The film does well in it's use of real quotes together with more modern usage of conversation. Great costumes and scenery

The death of Amy Robsart (Emila Fox) , Dudley's wife is portrayed as s suicide, though one that Dudley reacts callously to and the Elizabeth's rivalry with Lettice Knollys (Sienna Gillory) is part of the focus.
The last part deals with Elizabeth devotion to the young Robert Devereaux (Hans Mattheson) , Earlf of Essex, and frames Essex plot against Elizabeth as being intigated by his mother Lettice.
Anne Marie Duff portrays Elizabeth quite expertly. Effortlessly playing the role of a young Elizabeth through to her aging and death. Elizabeth is revealed as wise, strong, devoted to her country and people, at times capricious and ruthless when necessary. Her anguish at being forced to sign the death warrant of Mary Queen of Scots is revealed in a dream of herself being executed in Mary's place. Quite a lot of her life  is revealed in this film in dreams, such as her desire for Robin Dudleywhere she dreams of making love to him.

This film has virtually every film noir attribute: a femme fatale, plot twists, crime, mischief, suspense, lots of smoking, and shadowy cinematography. In this film, the film noir aura slowly builds- it even gets progressively darker in asthetic and feel, which is pretty neat. It's sort of like dimming the lights in a room. The acting is superb, as Greer and Mitchum have chemistry, and a young Kirk Douglas does a fine job.

This time around, Cotton is drawn into a conspiracy involving China, North Korea and the U.S., all relating to some documents that may prove the illegality of the American government's right to tax income, as outlined in the 16th Amendment.  Berry as usual does an excellent job of incorporating a nice mix of history and conjecture to advance the story, and Malone remains a likable lead.  Both FDR and Andrew Mellon play significant roles in the book, and Berry has obviously done his research in terms of some of the historical elements included.

The whole story takes place over a period of about 24 hours, which keeps the action going but also makes for a number of sequences that challenge even the most willing suspension of disbelief.

3078,"I have pretty mixed feelings here. There were some parts of this book I really liked, for example the fact that Lee let her main characters be bad. So often PNR heroines miraculously resist all evil temptation. I really appreciated that Alexa gave in to hers and admitted that she enjoyed watching Arys too. It added an element of edgy realism that I enjoyed. I also loved both Arys and Shaz. Unfortunately I hated the situation they found themselves in. It wasn't fair to either of them. Of course, it wasn't meant to be, but I found it painfully uncomfortable. I really wanted her to choose one or for the three of them to become a happy Mnage  trois.

I generally enjoyed the story, but I have two main complaints. One, it felt like there were four main story lines that ran parallel but never really intersected. There was Alexa and Arys' situation. There was her and Shaz's budding romance. There was her night job with Veryl and there was the whole mystery with Raoul. Any one of them probably could have been a book on its own. Well, maybe the love triangle would need to be combined, but you know what I'm getting at. The Raoul situation seemed to be the main storyline, so any time Alexa ran off to fight a random demon or psychotic ex-lover I found it distracting. It essentially felt like it had nothing to do with the rest of the plot. Plus the events required the introduction of random characters who then simply disappeared, Lilith for example.

Two, there was a lot of presumed knowledge. Alexas is described as a werewolf with extra, vampireish abilities. But these are never really described. I have no idea which of her powers were the unusual ones or why she had them. Similarly, I never really understood her and Arys' metaphysical draw. I certainly understood the effect, but not the why, how, or even what of it. I would have really liked a more in-depth description.

1915,"I love reading about Tudor England and thankfully, this book didn't disappoint! I'm always fascinated by how people lived in these times and learning about the court is very interesting. I would have to say that Anne of Cleves has been one of my favorite characters in these books (along with Mary Boleyn in The Other Boleyn Girl). Anne seems so innocent and really wanted to make a new life in England with the King. I loved that she wasn't necessarily as concerned about becoming Queen for the power, but more to get away from the life she lived with her family in Cleves. All she wants is to have some freedom, which for women now isn't too much to ask for, but it certainly was back then.

Katherine Howard... she is definitely portrayed as a stupid, young girl. She was somewhat entertaining, but so naive and ignorant. And Jane Rochford... well... she drove me crazy. At first I liked her and thought she was going to help out Queen Anne of Cleves. But then, once again, she just looks out for herself and seems to be willing to throw anyone under the bus as long as she is safe.

Overall, I really enjoyed this book! I was never bored and there is always something happening. I also love that it's told from different perspectives. I think, as readers, we would have lost a lot of the story if it were only told from one woman's view. Can't wait to read the next one in the series!

Though there are glimpses of Bryson's characteristic wit and engaging ability to tell history, science, and other intellectually-stimulating yarns, the book is mostly just a log of his complaining about the architecture of British cities while eating at pubs.

Would order and civility be maintained, or would the situation devolve until it became survival of the most ruthless?

Many other writers have put their characters in similar situations of isolation from society--Golding in 'Lord of the Flies' and McCarthy in 'The Road,' for example. What makes Saramago different is that he writes with great compassion for human beings, with all their faults and frailties. Maybe the difference lies in the fact that he was in his 70s when he wrote this, and by that time an intelligent person must develop compassion and empathy or go mad.

""Blindness' has the flavor of an allegory, with none of the characters named: we have ""the doctor,"" ""the doctor's wife,"" ""the girl with dark glasses,"" ""the boy with no mother,"" ""the old man with the black eyepatch,"" ""the dog of tears."" But Saramago allows the reader to form his own conclusions as to the meaning, perhaps giving clues but leaving much to think about.

The writing is clear and matter-of-fact, making scenes of horror and degradation even more effective by contrast. The punctuation, however, was a bit disturbing (for me, anyway): Saramago uses commas only, with no semi-colons, no colons, no quotation marks, no paragraphing in conversations, and few periods even. He also shifts between first-person and third-person narration with no transition. But after only a few pages, this works for him, and it even seems to fit perfectly into his story, providing the disorientation that blindness might provide.

1902,"The irrepressible Penn Cage is back again as the protagonist of a complex, action-packed page-turner set in Natchez, Mississippi. Penn Cage, former lawyer and prosecutor turned author, is shocked to discover that his best friend, Drew Elliott, successful local physician, has been having a tumultuous affair with gorgeous Kate Townsend, 17-year old high-achiever in the local high school. Kate has been found dead after being raped and strangled in the creek near Drew's home.

Drew asks Penn to represent him as his lawyer, and though Penn feels unprepared due to their long friendship and inexperience in capital cases, he temporarily acts as investigator and offers legal advice until he can find a more suitable defender. Drew claims that Kate was already dead when he found her at the creek and believes that Kate's dealings with some of the low-life drug pushers in the area may have been the actual cause of her death.

The trail of evidence points inexorably to Drew, and as each day passes, Penn is sickened and horrified by the revelations, though Drew continues to profess his innocence. Drew claimed to have been deeply in love with Kate, but Penn can't get over the unsuitably of such a dalliance, particularly the 23+ year age difference, and the fact that Drew is married.

The plot complexities stem from the entangled web of drug pushers and users that have invaded the quietly deteriorating back-water town of Natchez. It seems that every kid in the area, even the ""good"" ones, have attended the raves, are sexually promiscuous and are at least experimenting with, if not actually using a variety of drugs.

The multiple sub-plots humanize and allow us to empathize with the characters: Drew's flawed marriage and painkiller-addicted wife, Penn's faltering love life with Caitlin, Penn's respect and admiration for his father, and Penn's close but charged relationship with Mia, his daughter's 18-year old babysitter.

I've got two of the Kindle Keyboards and over the years I've bought a few of the Active Content apps for them. I could have put one of those on the Touch, but I felt like I needed a new challenge - so I bought this Sudoku Works game. I play a lot of Sudoku and have tried number of the android apps - but this active content game running on my new Kindle Touch beats them all. I can't get over how easy it is to use with the touch screen. You don't have to give the controls any thought, which makes for more concentrating on the game itself. I particularly like the Game of the Day - which was a bit easy today, but you can start a new game and set the difficulty level as needed.

This game gets my recommendation - especially if you got a Kindle Touch.

He is caught in a car accident, almost dies, and when he wakes from a coma, 4 days later, someone has stolen his identity.  The plot proceeds from there, with things getting worse and worse for poor Martin, who has no idea what's happening around him.  In the usual way of such stories, he hooks up (in the old sense, not the new) with the cab driver who saved his life and tries to find out what happened, bodies pile up, car chases and foot chases abound.

I really enjoyed ""Unknown,"" and only when it ended realized that there were some gaping holes in the plot.  That diminishes my enjoyment retrospectively.  I like movies to make sense.

Mayes' words are so evocative that the scenes she describes transport you from your armchair to Tuscany immediately.
I put off reading this for quite a while thinking it must surely be overhyped. I'm glad I got past that and allowed myself the pleasure of seeing Tuscany through Frances Mayes' eyes.
I think some of the negative reviews on Amazon carry overtones of jealousy. Sure we would all love to have the funds to have a second home in a scenic spot on the planet. Wouldn't we enjoy having the summer off to indulge ourselves playing lord of the manor? I sure would, but reading her book gave me the chance to experience it vicariously and I thank her for that.
If you saw the movie before reading this book, be aware that the movie was quite different.

660,"I enjoyed this book, as I enjoyed (more) Wright's other book on the Muslim Brotherhood, The Looming Tower. You know when you read a book by Wright that you are reading more than an in-depth magazine article, a syndrome that strikes so many so-called ""books"" these days. With Wright you are going on an extended voyage through a whole variety of issues. I have read a few other books on Scientology, including what I consider another great read, Bare-Faced Messiah, difficult to find, and a book by Hubbard's ex-Scientology son, also difficult to find. Both books, particularly the former, describe the criminal aspects of the Scientology enterprise. Wright's book seems to shy away from that, possibly due to the litigous threat of Scientology. But most irksome to me was Wright's penchant (starting on page 1) of calling scientology a ""religion."" Scientology, despite the appelation, is certainly not a ""religion"" and was only considered a ""religion"" starting a few years ago, after agreement from the government under Clinton to extend that tax shelter. Wright makes no mention of the ""fact"" (if it is one) that during his movie role in Primary Colors John Travolta (Scientologist) met with Clinton and the two engaged in a deal - if Travolta put a positive spin on his role as president Clinton would agree to enact a bill making Scientology a ""religion."" In fact this bill was passed while Clinton was president. Why? But Wright (almost on every page) goes to great length to call Scientology a ""religion"" until one's antennae go up: is he doing this to avoid litigation? Why cast doubt on so many of Scientology's other insane actions and not on this? Wright's attack would have been more hard-hitting and convincing if he concluded that Scientology is what it is - a cult.",4,"[-2.4916246796809176, -1.5958433002955277, -1.221126733802543, -1.019666523546316, -1.0951466880020475]",-1.019666523546316
529,"I doubt there is anything new that could now be said about Frank Herbert's 1965 masterpiece ""Dune"", so I won't try.  I've read that its the best-selling and most beloved science fiction/fantasy novel of all time.  I can now see why.  In the tradition of J.R.R. Tolkien, he created an entire fantasy universe all his own.  He liberally used rich Middle East imagery and terms for his desert planet Arrakis ('Dune').  The book contains royalty, races of superb fighters, sorcery, religions, monsters, space travel, futuristic weapons, and more.  Its message permits on multiple level at the same time (religion, philosophy, ecology, etc.)  It spawned a long series of novels which attracted legions of fans.  Although its very much a product of the 1960's, unlike some reviews I've read, I don't view the book as dated at all.  Highly recommended for fans of quality science fiction/fantasy.",4,"[-2.786586453731036, -1.466891638992894, -1.4368924884466576, -1.019848097341035, -1.0456472959060352]",-1.019848097341035
