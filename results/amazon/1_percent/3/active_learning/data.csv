200,"From reading the publishers reviews of this title, I expected Dismantled to be riveting. Although it is well-plotted for the most part and moves towards a ""frightening"" conclusion, McMahon asks a lot from her readers and expects a high degree of naivet. Between the oddly-prescient nine-year-old Emma De Forge, Emma's invisible sidekick, Danner, and the four college students who style themselves ""the Compassionate Dismantlers"", complete with manifesto, there are lots of misdirections in the story. On the face of it, the Compassionate Dismantlers are college rebels who indulge in petty pranks and criminal behavior on behalf of their beliefs, gathering at a remote Vermont cabin, where tragedy strikes one harrowing night, leaving the group with a dark secret.

In the near-decade since the group disbanded, Emma's parents, Henry and Tess, find their marriage floundering, the past weighing like a stone on the present. Suddenly it all becomes real again in the form of a postcard, Henry and Tess convinced their rural property is haunted by the dead. Emma begins snooping into her father's hidden papers at the instigation of her goofy school friend, Mel, the girls convinced the key to bringing the couple together lies in awakening the past. Emma's other friend is invisible; Danner tells secrets to Emma, their conversations increasingly troubling as evidenced in Emma's erratic behavior. Danner comes to life in the form of a rag doll Emma makes from scraps. The farm is literally crawling with malevolent characters, real and imagined, including a private detective who has been hired to dig into the suspicious activities of the Compassionate Dismantlers years ago at the cabin in Vermont.

What was most difficult for me to imagine is a group of art students embracing the concept of Compassionate Dismantlers- clumsy at best, ridiculous at worst. The leader of the group, Suz, is basically a sociopath who dresses in silk tunics, leotards and combat boots and has a grating penchant for calling everyone ""babycakes"". I really wanted this book to be more exciting and less middle-school scaring each other with horror stories. And I wish Emma wasn't so weird, regardless of her OCD. This book is perfect for a YA audience. But for grown-ups with a taste for Dan Simmons, Dismantled doesn't make the grade.

No....it was wrapped in a different paper. Kind, lovely and spanky dominating.
Sebastian a professor at the uni where Tristan follows a study besides his prof ice hockey career.
Grumpy professor and the ideal student. Sebastian in his thirties and Tristan a lot younger.

They started in a bad way with wrong assumptions Still the attraction coming from both sides. After the sky cleared and they are communicating much better they wait for a real date after Tristan finished his study. And then the heat is on. They started as a fling but within no time they spent all their time together.

Controlling and dominating Sebastian was a lust for my eyes. He was very tuned toward Tristan.
Tristan fit well in Sebastian's hands, especially his cheeks. (All four ;)
All the ingredients for a great story were there and all of them worked.

Tristan has fears to come out but his fear to loose Sebastian has to be bigger, if he wants Sebastian to hold on to their relationship, even if they love each other.

The whole story was steady, strong, lovely and together the men were hot.
I enjoyed it very much and only stopped reading when it was a necessary.
Everything past the revue, friends, colleagues, family and teammates....
Attractive way of writing it had a lot of feelings in the most appealing way.

7052,"I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review for Stephanie's Book Reports.

Breach is the first book in K.I. Lynn's Breach Series. It is a story that is complex and a little on the dark side.

Lila isn't living she is only existing. She has had a terrible past that no child should every have to live through. She was told daily just how worthless she was and that no one would ever want her by her father and his other family and it stuck with her and she has never overcome this.  She has a job as a lawyer and loves it as she transposes contracts and doesn't have to deal with people which suits her just fine. Until the day a new guy is hired and they have to share an office. From the second Lila and Nathan's eyes meet they each know that the other is truly not living. Nathan's past is mainly the big mystery in the book and it is pieced together as you read the book. As their attraction grows  Nathan fights it with everything he has as he feels no one should ever get attached to him. He will only cause them harm and his taste in the physical sense are on the extreme side. However together Delilah and Nathan can either heal or only cause each other more harm. Which will end up being the result?

This book had me from the very beginning. Lila's story will break your heart into a million pieces. I can not even imagine how someone can treat their child the way Delilah has been treated. And she has taken all the negative things and believes them just as anyone would. Nathan on the other hand is a bigger mystery but I loved him. He captured my heart and as a couple I loved them together but knew they needed some serious help if they were ever going to make it. This book is filled with hidden secrets and mystery and some pretty dark things that have happened. And there is a lot of scorching moments from the beginning of the book. It is a lot but I didn't let that distract from the story because I understood why it was happening so much. You will too when you read the book so don't let that make you put the book down.

Breach is a book so worth reading and the second you are done you will want to dive into Infraction. K.I. Lynn has created two characters your not soon to forget.",4,"[-2.3550564249959383, -1.5537583899616865, -1.0304198945939629, -1.035866323259817, -0.8972593407847471]",-0.8972593407847471
9335,"Synopsis: What's an attractive, motivated, upwardly mobile newscaster and supposed to do when confronted with the possibility of death? While doing an on-the-street interview with Prophet Jack (Tony Shalhoub), one of Seattle's local street derelicts and self-proclaimed prophet Lanie Kerrigan (Jolie) is told she's going to die within a week. When Prophet Jack's other predicts come true Lanie becomes a believer and finds herself re-evaluating her life and set things in order while there's still time.

Critique: `Life Or Something Like It' is a surprisingly good though obscure little romance/comedy from '02 starring Angelina Jolie and Edward Burns. This is a very different role for the sexy Angelina showing a comedic, vulnerable side that I haven't seen before. Edward Burns also delivers a rather subdued but strong role as her cameraman, nemesis and potential love interest Pete. Tony Shalhoub has a small but important part as Prophet Jack, adding a certain quirkiness and surreal quality to the film that works extremely well.

I am amazed at the level of details presented, and it is rather sad our mainstream press doesn't jump all over even one of these detailed facts: if the shoe had been on the other foot with their favorite whipping boy Bush, Obama wouldn't have a snowball's chance in this election. As it is, those who control the press are pushing their agenda.

If you want to read a well-researched and factual book about Obama, I encourage you to read this prior to the election.

The crate was WERY easy to unfold and set up, the wires are strong and the 2 doors are most convenient. They allowed us to set it up in a such a way that one door was opens permanently against a regular, wooden dog house while the other door is the exit. This way, the 2 have a 2-room apartment with full privacy in the dog house while the crate serves as the dining room/living. It's working very well. I would call it a comfortable apartment.

The only issue I have is the bottom tray. While it's convenient and allows for easy cleaning, the plastic is thin and, eventually it cracked. To my surprise, the tray did not completely fall apart. We are still using it and I now expect it to last in this condition for quite a while longer. Overall I am very happy with this product's durability.

As a first-time buyer, I consider myself lucky for getting the 2-door model, because I did not know what to look for at the time. My advice would be to anyone to go for the 2-door model.

691,"The Orphan Master's Son is a story about stories--in this case the stories the people of modern North Korea must make themselves believe in order to survive, stories that the government propagates about the Dear Leader, about how lucky citizens are to live in the glorious DPRK, about the sad state of life in America, even stories about individual citizens. One character says, ""Where we are from...stories are factual....For us, the story is more important than the person. If a man and his story are in conflict, it is the man who must change.""

We get to know this closed-off, dystopian society through the story of the life of Pak Jun Do (John Doe), a kind of North Korean Everyman. In somewhat Forrest Gump style, he variously becomes a tunnel fighter under the DMZ, a government kidnapper of foreigners, an English-language government listener on board a fishing boat, a member of a diplomatic mission to Texas, a miner as a prisoner in a prison camp, an impersonator of a famous General, and a love rival of the Dear Leader, Kim Jong Il. It is through his eyes and the eyes of his government interrogator that we see North Korea, as it is imagined (backed by research) by the author.

Even if the novel were not set in a country that is of particular interest to the U.S. right now, it would be riveting because Johnson is an extraordinary storyteller. In fact, if it had been set in an entirely imaginary place I might have enjoyed it more, because I kept being distracted from the story and its implications by wondering how close the details of life were to fact.

I am not so naive that I don't realize that America propagates its own stories about the glorious life in the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave and about the sad state of life in other nations which don't choose to follow our example. Still, I agree with this book's continuation of the above quote: ""But in America, people's stories change all the time. In America, it is the man who matters.""

Johnson has given us a compulsively readable and suspenseful story filled with adventure, terrible scenes of torture, and touching scenes of love and sacrifice. In tone it is somewhat satirical (especially in its depiction of the Dear Leader).

1734,"Abigail Keam in her new book, ""Death By Bourbon"" Book Four in the Josiah Reynolds Mystery series published by Worker Bee Press brings us another mystery to be solved by Josiah Reynolds.

From the back cover:  Life takes a dramatic turn for Josiah when she witnesses a death at an engagement party for guess who . . . Matt. Matt? Yes Matt.

Charming socialite Addison DeWitt falls into a fit after taking a sip of bourbon. That would be upsetting enough, but Josiah is sure it is murder. However, no one will believe her except for Lady Elsmere and Meriah Caldwell, the famous mystery writer. The three of them conspire to bring the murderer to justice. It turns out that the suspect is always three steps ahead of them.

To make matters worse, Josiah's daughter, Asa, decides to move to London, Franklin leaves town and Jake starts singing a different tune. Josiah doubts her ability to meet the future alone. Maybe it's time to sell the Butterfly and move to Florida with the rest of the old folks.

When I was growing up I read Agatha Christie's Miss Marple or watched Jessica Fletcher in ""Murder, She Wrote"" on TV.  I guess I  got used to a certain mystery style and was kind of shocked when I started reading about Josiah Reynolds.  Miss Marple or Jessica Fletcher she isn't.  The Kentucky setting is a lot of fun and, I think, the murder is unique, the victim dies right in the middle of a party.  However I felt the overall approach was ""mystery light"" and focused more on the drama going on in Josiah's life.  And there is quite a bit of drama.  I suppose this is the 21st Century mystery story and I see that others really liked this book and this series.  I guess I am not a 21st Century mystery reader and cannot see what they see.  I am sorry about that too as I really wanted to enjoy this book and then the series.

 How can you read the description of this book and not HAVE to read it? If you just look at the pieces of this story, you would never expect it to worka beekeeping chef and a misplaced girl from Wisconsin who hates New York? They both have issues. Their pasts have brought them to now  both in shattered pieces. Can they help each other put them back together?

The romantic relationship between May and Ben develops slowly. They get to know each other, their quirks and eccentricities. In the beginning, their sexual relationship is awkward. They grow in this part of their relationship as they begin to know each other better and become more comfortable. It is a well written storynot rushed - with plenty of character development. The reader has the opportunity to really get to know them, as they get to know each other. Ruthie Knox has magical word skills. I am a fan and will continue to read anything she decides to put on paper (or electronic media.) Her writing is fluid, with loads of sexiness and romance.

I couldn't help the ear-to-ear smile I had plastered to my face when reading this book it made me laugh out loud, even in a crowded doctors office! I loved the relationship between May and her sister Allie.  Allie reminded me of my sister. I could relate to them.

This is the first book of a trilogy. I cant wait to get my hands on the next one. I am definitely along for the ride.

The scenery is set very nicely.  Not enough that I felt like I was in the room but enough to make me comfortable in the story.  The characters are definitely well developed and show varied ranges of emotions.  The secondary characters are interesting but not as well developed.  It would be interesting to see more of Emma and Anthony - maybe the second book of the series?  The story is told strictly from the perspective of Katarina and reminds me of your old fashioned romances with an erotic twist to it.  Sex scenes are hot and varied.

It may have hit home a little closer because I am a thriving survivor of DV (although nowhere like what Kenzie endured, the emotional stuff? Can destroy).

9491,"A road trip with an overbearing Jewish mother and her guilt-laden son seems too clichd to be entertaining, and for the first one-third of the movie that was true. We learn that Andy (Seth Rogen) and his mom Joyce (Barbara Streisand) don't see each other often because she is a widow and lives alone in New Jersey and he lives in California where he went to college 10 years ago to become a scientist. He has developed a cleaning product and is peddling it across the country to large retailers, without much success, and decides on a whim to invite his mother along on the trip with San Francisco as their final destination. There are predictable scenes where she whips out a coupon at the car rental counter and guilts him into getting the little economy model car rather than the big comfortable SUV. She nags him constantly to drink more water, and worries why he has no current girlfriend. She gives him unwanted advice to help him pitch his product.

But eventually, the funny and touching scenes start to mount up; they stop at a strip club when they think they have a flat tire. Joyce downs a huge steak at a cowboy bar in Texas and gets caught up in a slot machine gambling and stays out all night in Las Vegas. Mom has brought along the audio book version of Middlesex, and if there is a more inappropriate book for a mother and son to listen to together, I can't imagine what it might be!

Surprisingly, the comedy tables are turned and Barbara Streisand gets all the funny scenes, with Seth Rogen playing the serious straight man. By the midway point of the film, I was cheering for both of them to appreciate each other more and for Andy to find success with his boring cleaning product.

The theme of an adult male trying to build a long lasting respectful relationship with his long suffering mother is one that many can relate to. The excellent casting decisions in ""Guilt Trip"" ensure that an otherwise jaded and perhaps boring premise achieves resonance with the audience.",3,"[-2.57360130311556, -0.9032535870344199, -0.9653692318742954, -1.0015563515159132, -1.277505913132707]",-0.9032535870344199
538,"Escape from Camp 14 is short (a smallish volume of about 200 pages) and to the point, providing an unembellished version of Shin's upbringing (if you can call it that), experiences in camp, escape, and post-camp life. It is also informative, with facts about such things as the number of persons forced to live in these camps and the huge disparity between the standard of living of Koreans living in the South and the North. The book's brevity was initially a bit of a surprise (certainly many more details could have been provided about Shin's camp experience, I thought), but as the man's story unfolds, the reason becomes obvious. With the enlightenment that living in the outside world brings, his complete lack of regard for his own actions, which directly or indirectly led to two of his family members' deaths, transforms into a certain level of awareness and possibly embarrassment, at least at how his lack of compassion might look to others. Thus Shin is reluctant to reveal certain information. In fact, he changes a critical part of his story midstream, that about his mother's capture, after recounting the same sanitized version many times over. Not unexpectedly, Shin has had a difficult time adjusting to life in the real world, holding down a job, and interacting with others. Benefactors' attempts to convert him to Christianity were interesting, though expected. Most surprising was the South Koreans' apparent lack of interesting in the plight of Shin and other political prisoners like him. Best of the book was the insight into camp life, worst, the wonderment of what may have been lost in translation.

The story is fast-paced and most of the characters have some likeable or redeeming qualities. It's a toss-up between Mr. Brown and Mason (supporting characters) as my favorite. There's three alternating POVs (a kidnapper, a private investigator, and a victim), which I enjoyed. So many perspectives. Also, the author does a nice job of illustrating the Florida Everglades and some of the fun and interesting people you would hope to meet. Some of the plot was a bit predictable and the big reveal behind the kidnapping wasn't as climatic as it could have been, but overall a decent read for fans of the series and people who read thrillers.

At nearly the same time, Bennett learns his wife is pregnant with their first child. The revelation increases his dedication to the case and desire to bring relief to the girl's distraught mother.

As Bennett probes the mystery his efforts are hindered by the stubborn resistance of the villagers to help, the interference of a superior officer and a self-serving reporter. As the investigation progresses, it becomes likely Alison Carter has been murdered, though no body is found. Bennett refuses to give up and with the help of his sergeant and team finds the evidence to hang the girl's stepfather for her rape and murder.

One of my problems with it was in how heavily the author carried her knowledge of the period, determined to impress us with how much she knew.

M.J. Carter has no such problem.

In sparkling prose she exposes us to early 19th century India, the ""Raj"", and a whole host of historical personages without our even noticing it.

Plus, she tells a bone-shakingly good mystery story!

Early reviews compare this to, among others, John Masters, Arthur Conan Doyle, Wilkie Collins, and others.

The one author no one has yet mentioned is, of course, the most obvious; perhaps BECAUSE it is the most obvious.

In William Avery and Jeremiah Blake Ms. Carter has created two memorable characters to rival the most interesting of Kipling's

But more than that, when I read a Carol Cassella novel I know I'm learning something, whether it's about the Olympic Peninsula and what it would be like to live there in poverty or about the deepest parts of a doctor's heart and how it feels to care deeply for a patient. This writer challenges her readers, not speaking down to us for a minute.
If you enjoyed the experience of reading The Goldfinch, The Husband's Secret, Gone Girl or any other recently read novel that was not only commercially successful but a story told beautifully, written with the highest regard for the English language and employing twists and turns to challenge the reader, I highly recommend you do yourself a favor and read Gemini.

Terry is a former FBI analyst who was medically retired due to a bad heart.  He has an extremely rare blood type and the chances of a transplant is just as rare.  Unfortunately someone has to die in order to donate an organ.  The trail of how he achieves this gift is twisted and not an easy one to follow.  The sister, Graciela, of his donor figures out he is the recipient of her sister, Gloria, and  makes contact with him.  How did she figure out who he was?  That is where the mystery begins.  She wants him to find Glory's killer.  He is reluctant, but takes on the case as a favor to her and to satisfy his own curiosity.  Of course he is blocked by the ""real police"" since he no longer carries a badge.  He overcomes with the help of multiple people and chases the clues to the end, in spite of blocking from the police.

Ethan Morgan didn't plan on spending the summer babysitting Zane Nashs half-sister while she photographs wildlife.  He has more important things he needs to be doing while he was in town.  But, there was just something about her that makes him want to spend more time with her.

Bridie and Ethan didn't expect to fall in love while out on the trails.  It happened before either knew what was going on.  Will this be enough for them to give up their lives they have made in other places and stay in Montana?

Bryce on the other hand, was very popular being on the football team, having excellent grades and being the mayor's son. Lexi was secretly in love with Bryce so when he went off to war, she sent him letters only signing them Miss. She didn't want him to know she was writing them.

When Bryce returned he wanted to find Miss. She seemed to understand him and her letters had gotten him through rough times so he needed to find this woman. I liked Lexi though I did feel sorry for her as a teen. If she had only known then that what she had thought about the popular kids not noticing her was wrong. In fact, they envied her relationship with Luke. He was Lexi's best friend, so she didn't notice he was gorgeous like the other girls did.

It was nice to see the changes in Lexi and Bryce when they meet again four years later. It was interesting to see how all the secrets were brought out.

This story ends with so many questions that I guess it would be called a cliffhanger ending. Even though I would love to get the answers, I won't buy the next book.

villains and goes to great length to make all of their opponents heroes. Path to Power is no exception this unfortunate trend.
Lyndon Johnson is a complex, tragic, and deeply flawed character worthy of a nuanced study. Instead Caro delivers a kind of Passion play, painting LBJ as an evil
man, devoid of redeeming features. What is amazing is the twisted lengths Caro will go to in order to write this story. For example, Coke Stevens, a racist white
supremacist with few redeeming features is rewritten as a kind of Lefty populist, simply because he is an opponent of LBJ. Efforts to create a black and white world,
with LBJ always in the black hat puts the usefulness of this entire massive biography in doubt.

Hopeless #2.5
This story is from Daniel Wesley's point of view. A glitch in his school schedule has given him a free fifth period. He's found that he can hide out in the closet and sleep. One day a girl tumbles inside by him. After a second intentional meeting with the unknown girl in the dark, he's never quite the same.

A year later he dumps his girlfriend and meets Six Jacobs. His best friend tells him to stay away from her. Game on. He has never felt so strongly about any girl like he does for Six. Could the pretend love he felt for the girl in the closet be a real feeling when it comes to Six?

This is just a short novella but still a full romance. They have more between them then they could ever realize. To meet more of the characters mentioned in this book you may want to read her previous stories. Book 1 - Hopeless and book 2 - Losing Hope.

This story makes one look at the different sides of a these concepts and allows us to chose which we think fits in this story.
The story begins with a 3 year old Azalea, being abandoned at a seaside amusement park by her mother on June 21st a midsummers day in 1982 and from that day on she will encounter many coincidences, both with that date, but with other things as well, but are they fate?.

Years later while teaching in in the same University as Thomas, she seeks him out as as he is known for his study of coincidences and scientifically figuring them out.  The book goes back and forth, from 1982 to present day and it is a story that makes you think about a lot of thing. Great story telling and a book I wish had gone on a bit longer.

However, this film brings to light his early days as a child, his strong family ties, his time as a human rights activist, and his years in prison during which he mellowed into a person of grace and peace. Idris Elba inhabited the role of Nelson Mandela in a credible and impressive manner. He adopted the mannerisms and speech patterns, and made you forget that he wasn't the ""real deal"".

One of the most interesting things that I learned from the film is that he and Winnie essentially switched roles. She became more strident and in support of violence to achieve equality, whereas he adopted the peaceful route. The film covers a very long time span, and in the process gives only a superficial coverage to the political and social upheaval of the time. Sometimes I just wished for more background or explanation of what was really happening in the country. The turbulence was acted out visually, but lacked substance - it was frequently just violence without explanation.

Adding to the problem is the funeral announcement she received from her mother Celia about her dad, wanting her to attend. Hunter is anxious for her to go and bury old hurts, but Fen isn't sure she will ever forgive her mother. Once circumstances forces her to go, she makes the trip and finds more than she bargained for including someone stalking her mother, Fens own odd stalker, and her trying to rescue a halfie. Will Fen rescue both her mother and the halfie, or will she end up a casualty in a war neither understands?

This book continues where the first one in the series left off and I must say the second is even better than the first! No, you don't have to have read the first one to read this one, but I do recommend it to know some of the backstory to make the book come more alive.

2665,"Normandie Fischers novels are southern fiction wrapped in bucket-list-trip locales. Its one of my favorite things about reading her books! The warm southern turn of a phrase juxtaposed against a romantic backdrop like Italy (or a thrilling one if you're reading her Isaacs House series!).

At the surface level, the story is about Sam and her decision (and failure) to avoid men for the rest of her life due to recent bad decisions. Italy seems to her like a good idea to gain new perspective so off she goes. Enter Teo, stage right.  I loved both of these characters, but especially Teo. His tender heart, his honest journey to God, his sense of humor, and the way he cares for Sam.

And yet. theres a much deeper theme to be found here as well. One of sin and its poisonous  and rippling  consequences. One of grace and the True Love that covers a multitude of those sins. One of healing found only in the Arms of the One who threw the stars into place and still knows your name and the number of hairs on your head. One of friendship and family and the power of both.

Bottom Line: Each sentence in a Normandie Fischer book reads like a warm hug and a tall glass of lemonade. Her writing voice beckons you to curl up and settle in for the duration as you savor the words, the characters, and their story. Sam and Teo are flawed, relatable, and genuine characters who present an authentic picture of life with all its up and downs  and of grace in all its beauty. Not to be missed!

Do you like relentlessly depressing books? Okay, cool, me too. Let me introduce you to Frank and April Wheeler, the married couple at the center of Revolutionary Road.

Set in the 1950s, Revolutionary Road takes place in a time when people clung tightly to traditional gender roles and believed deeply in the American dream. And on the surface, Frank and April have it all. Theyve built a life together in an affluent suburban community. They have a two beautiful children and a nice group of friends. Frank is even eying a promotion at his dull New York City office job.

The only problem, of course, is that the Wheelers don't actually want what April at one point refers to as the enormous, obscene delusion of suburban family life. The Wheelers  April in particular  feel trapped in the hopeless emptiness of their mundane existence, and their mutual dissatisfaction gradually destroys not only their marriage, but their sense of self.

Revolutionary Road is full of heavy, brutal, heart-wrenching dialogue between Frank and April, but the character who really stands out is John Givings, the mentally ill adult son of one of their friends. John serves as the unexpected voice of reason, outwardly condemning that same hopeless emptiness against which Frank and April quietly struggle, yet at the same time exposing the weaknesses and vulnerabilities at the heart of their inevitable downfall.",4,"[-2.6026830827808336, -0.908114601500607, -1.178037701602453, -1.0236324006829571, -1.0050894193678068]",-0.908114601500607

2774,"I picked up this book to read because though I am younger than the 60's, and I am not a Deadhead, I have seen the Dead in concert and enjoyed their whole scene.  It's fun, entertaining and interesting.

I am familiar with Mr. Kreutzman, the drummer, and thought any memoir by a Dead band member has to be good.

This is a fun read with lots of interesting stories.  The whole of the experience is here, from Haight Ashbury to lot of great interactions with famous and infamous figures from music and other fields.  The Dead have traveled and given lots of concerts in some amazing places and there are lots of stories here.  And, though there are lots of stories of drugs and booze, this is not just a 'been there done that' type of book.  There are many really interesting stories of this great band over many, many years.

This was a fast, entertaining read and is well worth it.  If you have the slightest interest in finding out about the music scene from the 1960's and traveling with this book, then I urge you to read it.  You do not have to be a die-hard Deadhead to enjoy the book.  It is really full of some great stories and well worth reading it through.

Unfortunately, Jerry Garcia left us, but this book will inform many of why the Dead were such an incredible phenomenon. A good read.",3,"[-1.5602668365609418, -1.2108647338814194, -1.0702145892042438, -0.9989455752193327, -0.9091592481548918]",-0.9091592481548918

Harry Bosch has a new partner, Lucia Soto, AKA Lucky Lucy, nicknamed after a gang shootout.  Lucy is also new to the homicide division and she has a hidden agenda.
Harry and Lucy are assigned to the case of the murder of the mariachi player and are led down many paths of discovery.  Lucy actually became a police officer because of a horrendous fire when she was 7 that took the lives of her classmates and beloved teacher, the Bonnie Brae Hotel fire.  Coincidentally, there was a robbery at a  nearby cash checking company.  Were the two crimes somehow connected?  Where was the nexus between the fire and the robbery?
They were working on the murder, also, and since a big reward had been promised, they began getting a lot of calls.  One seemed to have information, but she refused to leave her name.  She told them the ""mayor"" knew something, and a man with a lot of money was behind it.  The tip eventually paid off, but not before someone was killed.  They eventually tracked down everyone who worked at the cash company, except for one, a woman known as Ana.  Ana had been a resident of the Bonnie Brae AND worked at the cash company, but she had disappeared right after the robbery, 21 years ago.

The main characters aren't always likeable but they each have an important role to play. The biowarfare specialist, Carolyn Ridenour, is a strong central figure for whom you keep rooting to get through to some of the military-like government officials. There are some characters who aren't what they seem and enough plot twists to keep you guessing, including at the end. I don't want to say more since that would give away too much.

Cash is able to weave the ghosts and their own part of the story seamlessly into the story of the living characters.  The utilization of ghostly interference as the creation of the angst in the relationship of Julie and Brad is very well done.  Cash is able to show in myriad fashion the ups and downs that every marriage could face in a way that is neither preachy or insulting.  You really feel for Julie and for Brad as they face the challenges both financial, emotional and supernatural.  The concept of buying an old run down place to flip and finding it haunted is brilliantly simple and plays well in a popular 21st real estate concept.  The ghost of Tessa and Gerald are as complex as the living.  I loved the book, I loved the ghosts and loved Julie and Brad.

General Mark Grimaldi, the sky master, had worked his way thru the ranks without his families influence and is on the brink of being named Home Secretary.  There is just one small requirement to the position-he needs a wife. No problem, because what very few know is that Mark has been estranged from his wife Nicole for over 10 years. Ms. Bowman sets up a negotiation: Mark needs Nicole to be the dutiful loving wife until he obtains the position and Nicole has been lonely and wants a baby. This is where Ms. Bowmans masterful writing takes over as she weaves a storyline that captivates the reader and gives us insight into their early relationship as they both struggle with their current feelings and emotions, issues of duty and family loyalty as well as several surprise revelations concerning Marks family. The plot is fast paced with a mystery to solve, the characters fascinating and mutli-dimensional and the storyline very enjoyable.

The protagonist, Three was a unique blend of Jason Bourne, Obi Wan Kenobi, Luke Skywalker, MacGyver, Sylvester Stallone, Indiana Jones and James Bond. Quite the mix up! In other words he is very quiet, only speaks when needed, a brutal fighter, a very wise and yet a risk taker, a ladies man, who has a place in his heart for friends and actually cares about people even though he thinks he shouldn't. One of the few people that navigate the wastelands, where nasty bio-human-monsters hunt humans (that made the hair on the back of my neck standup), safely. Who finds it right to save a mother and a son that he doesn't know and suddenly the journey that was once safe is now riddled with second thinking his choices and more to worry about that himself.

341,"One would not necessarily expect a book about an evil ancestor and multiple family suicides to be funny, but this one is.  It's funny in a dark way, of course, but the author's incisive, hilarious wit is one of the best features of this book.  The book focuses on three sisters who believe they are haunted by a family curse, one that leads their family members to commit suicide in a wide variety of ways.  The three sisters live in New York, and are convinced that they cannot escape the family curse.  They plan to stop trying to escape fate and make plans for a collective suicide, in the finest family tradition.  In getting there, they tell the history of their oddball family.

She is his son's nanny and after clearing some misconceptions about her best friend, Noah, she doesn't feel as guilty being with Zach until his ex comes back wanting a relationship with her son....or does she?
A fast paced steamy steamy read which had the sparks and attraction between them. I also couldn't help but feel for Uma when she sacrificed her happiness by stepping aside when the ex comes back. Not only that but she didn't take Zach up on his proposal to stay, not accepting his money and would rather go back home to her parents in shame than use him. The airport scene near the end was perfect along with the ending with her parents and the whole ceremony when they finally reached their HEA.

3816,"I was immensely excited to begin my reading of the Search and Rescue series written by author, Katie Ruggle. Overall I think that my expected hype of the both the stories and the plot did live up the expectations of the book itself.

 Since there was a lot to love about the novel I had to narrow my search (no pun intended) down and decide what stood out to me the most about the story and the characters. To start the story contained a large amount of apprehension that was mostly related to Lou, the heroine. The suspense probably much ruled this story from start to finish and certainly kept my pulse racing in anticipation to uncover what would happen next.

The characters were just as exciting, but I think that Callum, the hero contained the most thrill for me. At times he did overshadow Lou's characters, but I suppose that is the way that things have to be in this book as the backdrop of the plot would have been off balance otherwise. However Callum is still my favorite character. I liked how determined and dedicated he was at his job. The rocky mountains are not the ideal place for safety, but together Callum and his team of the brotherhood of the Search and Rescue do their best to protect and to serve.

Now, I have to include a flaw with the story and that is the chemistry involving Callum and Lou. The chemistry was toned-down. I was highly surprised by this fact because the story is so intense that I originally thought that the romance and the attraction of the twosome would reflect such a engagement of the actual story, but it didn't. The chemistry was a disappointment for me because that lead to not a strong contemporary romance in the end.

Regardless of how I feel about the romance I would still recommend this book as I plan to continue this series. In my opinion it is difficult to judge a book at the conception of a new series and so I am going to look forward to what this series will deliver in the near future.",3,"[-2.632153596495411, -1.834964858883965, -1.211517996085811, -1.0363111767203108, -0.9148108442911291]",-0.9148108442911291

Defense attorney Andy Carpenter spends most of his time as partner of a dog rescue group.  When a former white-color-crime client escapes from prison, taking with him a puppy-for-prisoners program, and is accused of murdering his soon-to-be-ex-wife and former partner, Andy finds he has no choice but to get back into the legal game.  He just didn't expect it to be as dangerous as it is.

What an excellent cast of characters with Andy, his wife Laurie, partner Willie, Marcus, and others.  We are easily introduced to each of them and provided their backgrounds in such a way that readers new to the series need not feel lost or confused.  And although there are not nearly as many characters as some authors include, Rosenfelt has a nice way of, within the plot, reminding one of whom some characters are and their role in the story.

Rosenfelt is the master of dry, biting humorSam does not realize it, but hes two boring sentences away from strangulation.  Who has not known someone about whom they feel that way?

One issue with having a wealthy protagonist is his ability to buy information; money is no object.  It does feel a bit too easy at times.  However, the information on online betting is rather interesting.

There are a number of threads to the plot.  Whilst one doesnt know quite where the author is going with them, one does know to trust that the author knows.  Rosenfelt does an excellent job of taking those seemingly loose threads, making their importance clear, and finally tying them all together.  His courtroom scenes are well done.  The author does an excellent job of explaining various aspects of the law.

Outfoxed is a very good read with action, suspense, legal and courtroom drama, a dash of wry humor, and a very satisfactory ending.

That being said, there's something disingenuous about a strikingly beautiful woman writing about the struggles of women  trying to lose weight. I've met Berg in person, and she's drop-dead gorgeous. Perhaps if I didn't know that, I'd be better able to accept her writing about weight issues.

This is the second book that I have read by Ms. Bondurant this is also the second book in this series and I simply loved it hands down.  Ms. .Bondurant has evolved as a writer and her strengths are evident in her first book and are even more pronounced in this book.

She is newly promoted as the vice president in a New York advertising company, she has beauty, brains, and one hell of a fierce reputation she is so put together on the outside that you wouldnt know she is fighting her own demons.
Brian Carpenter has an easygoing personality and Southern charm and is the yang to Sashas yin and the calm to her storm.  He is finding it hard manage his newest VP isn't without its challenges, but when it comes to Sasha, he'd expect nothing less.
Over the last few years of their friendship, the flirtations, innuendos, and chemistry have almost led to more on one occasion but Sasha has convinced herself they're better off just friends.

The Target is the second book about Jessica Reel and Will Robie, two of the CIA's most talented assassins.  In the first book about them they had both been assigned to kill the other.  Jessica had discovered two traitors working at the CIA and determined that in spite of orders they must be killed.  The ending of that book leaves both Will and Jessica under scrutiny by their supervisor, but close together and partners.
  The Target opens with the pair being assigned to the ""Burner"", a CIA training depot for retraining to perform an operation sanctioned by the president of the United States.  It looks like they are actually there to be killed for their behavior in book one of the series.  Events than cause the pair to witness a suicide of a top ranking North Korean General, Jessica to remeet her father whom she hasn't seen in years and than both be assigned to extract two people from a concentration camp in North Korea.
  In the course of the novel Baldacci introduces a North Korean assassin named Chung Cha, a deadly woman that has lived her entire life in training to become a killer with no peers.  His treatment of her thoughts and feelings , and her ability to perform her assigned tasks is,by itself a masterpiece.  He brings his readers into the mind and reactions of a person so alien to the normal world that, it could be the centerpiece of the book.

Jaffe is obsessed with proving him innocent even at the risk of losing his wife, his son Alan, and his partnership in an affluent Sarasota Florida firm along the way.
  The mystery is not obtuse so the reader will likely guess the ending but the battle for a hearing to overturn the execution is wonderfully done even if it does go overboard in it's anti-death penalty theme. It is superbly written and the characters are all richly painted: flaws and all. The legal maneuvering is fascinating and the frantic pace of Jaffe's attempt to finish his goal,despite obstacles of immense proportion, makes the read exciting.

I love this series, it gives me the same feelings that I got when I read Jessie Evans Always a Bridesmaid series or Melody Annes Billionaire Bachelor Series starring The Andersons  that feeling that I want to  no need to  devour all the books and never want the series to end.  Each book is better than the last and we get to see what the previous characters are up to now.

While this is Book 3 in the Something Series, it can be read as a stand-alone.  I think if this is the first story you are reading in the series, you are going to fall in love and want to go back to the beginning.  Please do, you won't be disappointed.

Kenzie and Colby have always been in each others life.  In fact Colby is older than Kenzie so hes actually known her family longer than she has.  His brother is best friends with her brother and Colby and Kenzie have become best friends over the years as well.  Thats all Im going to say about the story because I just don't want to ruin it for you.

This is a fast read that had me hooked from the very first page.  Its light and easy and not too angsty, its the perfect romance novel that took me out of my hectic day and brought me into someone elses world.

I seriously don't want this series to end.  There are so many characters that I still want to learn about.  Pardon me while I go one click the next in the series.",4,"[-2.6902243037772893, -1.8990485578019494, -1.0324446259526494, -1.010407310487652, -0.9213244246524741]",-0.9213244246524741
2623,"Received a copy of the title from author in exchange for an honest review.

In the previous book, we saw first hand how an arranged marriage worked -- but for Damian Rossi and Lili DeLuca, it actually worked.

In RECKLESS & RUINED, we see first hand a relationship that's not meant to be in this lifestyle -- a relationship that is actually born of love and true, deep feelings, and the outside factors of being a part of a mob family, furiously trying to rip said relationship apart.

Ever since Adriano rescued Alessa from Dean's wrath in high school, they've been inseparable. They love one another and are trying to find a way to make their love work. Alessa's older brother, though, is arranging for Alessa to marry Dean -- who is still an unmade man, who is still an ass, and who still isn't afraid to put his hands on Alessa in anger. Bethany-Kris definitely has a talent in making a reader dislike one of the player's in a story.

Alessa and Adriano's book is a bumpy one. We start just after Adriano's mother was killed at the restaurant, and right before Dino's death in a car bomb. We learn a little bit more about both situations, too. And while I enjoyed getting those insights from other families in this group, it was really Adriano and Alessa's struggle to be together that was the driving, even if at times heartbreaking, force throughout this story -- as it should have been. I would have liked to see more of their ending, though, and am hopeful to seeing glimpses of them in the coming stories (next being Adriano's sister and the last being Alessa's sister).

I am super excited for the next book. With all the wrongdoings going on in this war that started in DEATHLESS & DIVIDED and further escalated here, we've watched families (in the mob sense) torn apart, and the next book in the series belongs to Theo and Evelina, Adriano's sister. Evelina is best friend's with Theo's sister, Lily, but wasn't allowed to be in the wedding of Lily and Damian due to families being at odds. I can't wait to watch that drama unfold for them.",4,"[-1.021706383887233, -1.1298490577329507, -1.4558536964004538, -1.0123895716406075, -0.9213562800079255]",-0.9213562800079255

It is up to Adam to put an end to the war. I have to admit that going in to this I was not excited at all. The trailer wasn't that exciting to me and I was expecting it to be so cheesy that it would be unwatchable. I'm not sure if it was my expectations or not but I ended up really liking this. The best part of the movie was this it didn't try to be anything it wasn't There was a few minutes of story but it really was just one long battle sequence. That made it exciting. Even though it's PG-13 it's nothing like the Legend Of Hercules PG-13. Hercules was hurt because it didn't show any blood and the fighting looked more intense then it showed. This movie, while no blood, every time a demon died a line of flame came out which made it seem like something was happening. Overall, much better and more exciting then I was expecting. Nothing more then a long fight scene but it was exciting and fun to watch. Also one of the better 3D movies I have seen, some very neat effects.

I really liked Sara and Max from the start.

Sara, a friend of Chloe, who moves to New York after a horrible break up meets Max at the club her first couple of days in town.

Max is total swoon worthy. Sexy, Confident, British and the type of guy that could get any girl he wants.

After a little back and forth they come up with an agreement that is pretty hot. The sex isn't over the top but the fact that it involves a lot of picture taking and public sex makes it very interesting. BS was a good type of steamy but the story, their backgrounds and them just getting to know each other outside of sex made it that much better.

I felt bad for Sara and her background. For all that she'd gone through I understood why she felt and did some of the things that she did. I liked how patient Max was. His honesty made him so trustworthy despite his documented playboy ways. Together they fit and it was perfect.

Their paths cross at the Saturday market in Manhattan where many farmers come to sell their products.  Natalie, who used to have low self-esteem issues due to her weight (she's a size 18), is now a very confident, self-assured young woman who isn't shy about seducing a man who catches her eye.  She has an enviable success rate with the men in her life, although her sexual escapades are short-lived, by choice.  With Oscar, however, Natalie is so captivated by his overpowering good looks, physique and the sexual chemistry between them that she can't manage to say more than 2-3 words to him whenever she buys cheese from him on Saturdays.  His interest in her is clear, but he doesn't take the initiative either.  All that changes when the marketing company Natalie works for is hired to launch an ad campaign to bring more tourists to Bailey Falls, Oscar's hometown.  It's also where Roxie, one of Natalie's best friends, lives.  Natalie gets the Bailey Falls assignment and goes there for the weekend.  Due to some matchmaking efforts by Roxie, the relationship between her and Oscar starts to develop.  The relationship has its issues: the distance between them, Oscar's ex-wife (she's only a good friend to Oscar, but the ex is very territorial and dependent upon him), Natalie's reluctance to trust/be defined by a man due to a disastrous relationship with her first boyfriend which caused some pain that still lingers beneath the surface, Oscar's lingering issues due to pressure from his father when he was growing up.  Natalie and Oscar were introduced in the first Hudson Valley book, Nuts.  The couple from that book make good secondary characters in this one, especially Roxie.  Natalie is quite outspoken and her blunt ways caused some very humorous moments.  Oscar was very clueless (typical man!) when it came to his ex.

8675,"PURSUED BY THE ROGUE is the first in a four book, multi-author series called Fairytales of New York. The stories are connected by four heroines who have been friends since boarding school. Each story is based off of a different fairy tale. This one is inspired by Hans Christian Andersens, The Ugly Duckling.

I don't know where to begin to review PURSUED BY THE ROUGUE by Kelly Hunter. There are so many layers to the main characters. The story is almost a life lesson in what to do right and what to do wrong - and the impact that parental actions have on their children. It is also a love story between two mismatched souls and how their differences combine to make them perfect soul mates.  They both filled needs for the other that no one else could. It wasn't without problems however, and not without a few bumps and bruises. These two each have a complicated and emotionally twisted past. This book captivated my interest from the first page all the way to the end.

Dawn suggests a no-strings attached relationship with Finn. Finn wants more. Can he convince Dawn that she is more than what she perceives herself to be? Can she overcome her insecurities and believe herself worthy of a happily ever after?

The chemistry between Finbar Sullivan (dont you just love that name?) and Dawn Turner is potent, and unfolds with the perfect amount of tension. Kelly Hunter weaved an intricate and interesting plot. It deals with real-life issues. These two have a lot of issues to work through.  I love how the author dealt with them honestly and realistically. It made me glad that I spent the time reading it. It is not just romance, although there are some very steamy moments between Finn and Dawn. You cannot finish this book without falling in love with Finbar Sullivan!

This was a fantastic beginning to the Fairytales of New York series and another great book from Kelly Hunter! I highly recommend! This story has a little of it all... action, romance, mystery and great characters that leave you wanting more by the end. Yep, I'm a fan and can't wait for the next book in the series.

494,"First Sentence: To judge from the entrance the dawn was making, it promised to be a very iffy day--that is, blasts of angry sunlight one minute, fits of freezing rain the next, all of it seasoned with sudden gusts of wind--one of those days when someone who is sensitive to abrupt shifts in weather and suffers them in his blood and brain is likely to change opinion and direction continuously, like those sheets of tin, cut in the shape of banners and rooster, that spin every which way on rooftops with each new puff of wind.

I appreciate a good analogy and so enjoyed the opening paragraph of this book.  Camilleri creates a very strong sense of place with his evocative descriptions.

The author has also created a strong, interesting character in Montalbano.  He is a study in contrasts; calm facing a Mafia chief in a tense situation, yet goes into panic before the press; he can be quite crass, yet also very sensitive ""That morning, by surprising the two kids making love, he had desecrated life; and now, by exposing the two bodies that should have remained forever unknown to the world in their embrace, he had desecrated death.""  He has a morbid fear of being promoted and suffers from mild synesthesia which converts smells into colors for him.

There is very good dialogue, including amusing non-sequesters, which adds realism to the story as well as retaining a sense of Italy.

The plot is intriguing and clever as it is one thread which leads to another, but it is the character of Montalbano who really kept me reading.

""The Terra-Cotta Dog"" was a very enjoyable read and Camilleri and wonderful addition to my list of authors whose books are set in Italy.

Would order and civility be maintained, or would the situation devolve until it became survival of the most ruthless?

Many other writers have put their characters in similar situations of isolation from society--Golding in 'Lord of the Flies' and McCarthy in 'The Road,' for example. What makes Saramago different is that he writes with great compassion for human beings, with all their faults and frailties. Maybe the difference lies in the fact that he was in his 70s when he wrote this, and by that time an intelligent person must develop compassion and empathy or go mad.

""Blindness' has the flavor of an allegory, with none of the characters named: we have ""the doctor,"" ""the doctor's wife,"" ""the girl with dark glasses,"" ""the boy with no mother,"" ""the old man with the black eyepatch,"" ""the dog of tears."" But Saramago allows the reader to form his own conclusions as to the meaning, perhaps giving clues but leaving much to think about.

The writing is clear and matter-of-fact, making scenes of horror and degradation even more effective by contrast. The punctuation, however, was a bit disturbing (for me, anyway): Saramago uses commas only, with no semi-colons, no colons, no quotation marks, no paragraphing in conversations, and few periods even. He also shifts between first-person and third-person narration with no transition. But after only a few pages, this works for him, and it even seems to fit perfectly into his story, providing the disorientation that blindness might provide.

Don't get me wrong, the Night Huntress series on a bad day, is still leaps and bounds ahead of most books on their best days.  Some of the dialogue was laugh-out-loud funny.  I love our characters and the great world Jeaniene Frost has built around them.  But noticeably absent in this installment is any tension between Cat and Bones.  Of course, at a certain point it is laughable to think anything can come between these two. But the tension present in every book before this one helped make them explosive.  Here, we had one memorable sex scene, which frankly had me more distracted by the practicality of the abundant use of hot wax, than allowing me to really get into the moment.

The premise for this story is that the ghouls are still pushing the idea of war against the vampires. And Cat is their rallying point, with the unusual talents she has manifested. She and Bones go back to New Orleans to consult with Marie Laveau who boosts Cat with some black magic mojo.  In the meantime, Cat reaches out to her network of friends to try to stop the war from happening.

To me, the threat just didn't seem as in-your-face as in times past. I never felt real danger.  I was only really moved with the surprising storyline surrounding Don.  And other than with him, I didn't feel the same connection I usually do with the supporting characters.

490,"To make an accurate prediction you need to have the right sort of information and to be able to sort the relevant bits from the irrelevant noise.  This book explores prediction across many fields including gambling, medicine, the stock market, sport, earthquakes and terrorism.  The author looks at how and why some people seem to be very good at analysing data and why other predictions go disastrously wrong.

I found the book an interesting read though at times it was heavy going.  I confess to slimming through the chapters on gambling and sport!  There are many diagrams and graphs to illustrate the points made in the text and there are notes on each chapter so that the interested reader can follow up events and studies mentioned in the text.

I think the chapter on earthquakes was the most interesting for me.  This is a field where it is impossible to predict with any degree of detail.  Past earthquakes can be observed and studied and we have a great deal of data on them.

8731,"The Cougar's Trade (Desert Guards, #2)
by Holley Trent

Another Foye male has to bite the bullet and try to get his mate to stay.

Miles is really ready to get out of there. Her friend Hannah and she have basically been prisoners for a month and they are both wanting to leave, but now the guys have finally decided to choose. Only at first, they choose wrong.

Hank was sure that the feisty spitfire named Hannah was to be his fated mate, but things just don't feel right, so he and Sean switch girls. He just thinks that Miles is all wrong for him. He is the Alpha's second and he needs a strong woman, both physically and mentally to stand by his side. He knows the goddess has to have made a mistake. Even though he is sure Miles is wrong for him, he has to get her to agree to stay or he will shift and stay that way.

Miles doesn't like to fight, in any way. She would rather work things out as peacefully as possible. She may be little, but she isn't afraid of much. She is an intelligent woman and because of her size most people underestimate her, including Hank.

I understand that there needs to be obstacles and hard times for a couple to overcome but I felt like what Aubrey was put through was too much. I think I was okay with what happened up to a certain point then I felt like the rest was maybe for shock value. I admire what Aubrey did with what she was handed but at the same time I am having a hard time believing she would keep so much of what she did from Dylan. I instantly loved Dylan, I'm all for the cocky a*shole, that owns what he is. From the very beginning he was smitten with Aubrey and I loved watching their relationship go from nothing to everything. The build up was great, I loved how she took the time for them to care about each other and learn to love themselves first. This is not an insta love kind of story and I think that is one of my favorite things about the story. I also had some issues with the way they were in the beginning, having a fifteen year old daughter myself, some of their conversations and things they did seemed to be what older kids do but maybe that's just the way things are away from where I live. I don't think it should be labeled as a stand alone, that's the other half of my reason for only giving 3 stars. So much is repeated from books one and two throughout I got bored and felt like I was wasting my time. If it was labeled to read the first two books then a lot of that repetitiveness could be eliminated and we could get more story of Dylan and Aubrey. I think M Robinson did a good job writing the book, there were some hard issues and I really think she did well with them and I don't feel like she left anything out or unanswered where Dylan and Aubrey are concerned.",2,"[-2.4496786062241336, -1.1000972799844067, -0.9257190888582632, -1.0181323639686533, -1.3519301133063464]",-0.9257190888582632

409,"I loved Water for Elephants, so I was excited to get into another book from Sara Gruen. What I expected to be a sad story focused around World War II, was actually a really different and interesting story. It was a journey of self discovery, that took me by surprise.

Maddie, her husband Ellis and their best friend Hank travel to Scotland in the midst of World War II. Theyre on a mission to find the Loch Ness monster. The only way for Ellis to get back in his fathers good graces is to return with proof that the monster exists. Its a desperate attempt to save his allowance.

The hellish and grueling trip lands them in a small town, in a hotel with no electricity and people surviving on rations. Its nothing like the lavish and spoiled lifestyle theyve become accustomed to. The guys spend their days drinking and sitting next to the Loch in hopes of catching the monster on film, while Maddie sits bored in the hotel.

The change of surroundings, the relationships Maddie makes with the hotel staff and the hardships she sees all around her, force her to look at things in a different way. Especially where her husband is concerned. Things she never realized about him, or turned a blind eye to, start to surface. Things she cant ignore.

I liked how this story unfolded and the many secrets that were revealed along the way. It wasn't at all what I expected from a story set in this time period, and that was sort of refreshing. I honestly thought in the beginning that the whole Loch Ness monster storyline was a little hokey, but once all the folklore and family secrets started to surface, it changed my mindset. I was hooked. It ended up being an interesting story about finding family in unexpected places, letting go of the past and following your heart. Of course, the love story was my favorite part. I really liked big, burley, Angus. Overall, a great read.",3,"[-2.066716415607647, -1.4748369808262254, -1.164283991114389, -1.0312434308457274, -0.9261426444945804]",-0.9261426444945804

Her father is a police officer who's raising his children by himself. When Charlie comes home with another speeding ticket he tells her to get a job, so she can pay for it. She finds one in a clothing store, but to work there she has to change her style. Her sporty outfits and trainers are not allowed at work. There she has to look cute and feminine.

Charlie has terrible nightmares when she doesn't go for a run before bedtime. She finds comfort in midnight talks with Braden. When they're both on their own side of the fence they can talk about things that will never come up during the day. When Charlie starts to date a boy she knows via the boutique Braden isn't very happy. Is he jealous or is something else going on?

On The Fence is a great teenage love story. Charlie is a sweet girl who doesn't dare to tell people how she feels, because she thinks they will find her weak if she does. She has a lot to learn. Meanwhile there's someone she likes very much, but she doesn't allow herself to go there. On the Fence is a simple, light summer read. There's a bit of depth that makes the story stand out.

Puller, a chief warrant officer with the Armys Criminal Investigation Division (CID) is the son of the Armys most decorated 3-star general. The father is presently institutionalized with Alzheimers. Puller also has a brother, Robert, who was an Air Force major with a brilliant scientific mind and promising military career who, two years ago, was sentenced to life for the high crime of treason. He was incarcerated in the DB lockup at Ft. Leavenworth. However, Robert Puller miraculously escapes from Leavenworth (first ever) and John Puller is assigned by his boss and several top Pentagon generals the task of tracking brother Robert down and returning him to the DB. To assist him in this task he is assigned a partner, a gorgeous female from the intelligence community, Army Captain Veronica Knox. Puller likes working alone, as does Knox. The joint arrangement results in major personality and procedural conflicts between the two. John Puller is an honest, courageous and trusting person whose values conflict with Knoxs who comes from the shadowy side of the intelligence field where she was taught to lie and deceive to reach her goals. The plot heads in many directions often all at the same time. The story supports a cadre of interesting characters most of whom eventually turn up dead.
 One cannot help but like John Puller, his brilliant investigative techniques, his intuitiveness, his all encompassing honesty and his tenacity in pursuit of justice make him a life-size hero. I believe David Baldacci comes closer to matching the well-researched writings of the late Vince Flynn than any other author of this genre and generation of writers.

She manages everything, including her brother, the Duke of Ravenwood's home. She can foresee pretty much any possibility and leaves nothing to chance. One would almost think she was prescient, but no, just highly organized with a gift for memorization utilizing word association.

When Amelia realizes she must find a husband, she decides she will use Viscount Sheffield's Annual Christmas Ball to get every eligible man of interest under one roof, in order to take her pick. When her brother informs her the ball is to be cancelled due to the orchestra stage being struck by lightning, Amelia decides she must step up to the plate and assist Viscount Sheffield find another venue for the ball. The. Show. Must. Go. On.

What we have, however, in Viscount Sheffield is a man who has his own way of administrating his life and is very highly organized, yet manages to leave time out for fun - business takes place from 8:00 in the morning to 8:00 in the evening. Then, pleasure begins for the ensuing 12 hours and never the twain shall meet. In other words, business isn't mixed with pleasure and nothing ever mixes up his routine. At least, that was his routine until the day Amelia enters into his orderly world with her management skills.

Very shortly, Viscount Sheffield decides Amelia needs to be shown how to have some enjoyment to her life, even as Amelia ever so skillfully manages him into having the Annual Christmas Ball.

500,"Let me start by saying that I generally love historical mysteries. They intrigue me and educate me about a time and place that I am not familiar with. I was looking forward to C.J. Sansom's ""Dissolution"", a mystery that takes place in a monastery during the English Reformation. However, the setting proved to be not my cup of tea. That being said, the book definitely has redeeming qualities.

C.J. Sansom has definitely researched this time period well, and his concluding historical note clarifies many of the points made in his book. It all begins in November 1537 when Dr. Matthew Shardlake, a lawyer working for Lord Thomas Cromwell in London, is asked to go to the Monastery of St. Donatus in southern England. One of Cromwell's commissioners, Robin Singleton, had been down there trying to negotiate the monks' surrender to Henry VIII. However, Singleton was found beheaded, and it is up to Shardlake and his assistant, Mark Poer, to discover who committed the heinous crime.

On the first night of their stay, another tragedy unfolds when a young novice, Simon Whelpy, becomes ill and dies a day later. The infirmist suspects poisoning, and the fact that Whelpy died before telling Shardlake about another possible murder leads Matthew to suspect that more is going on. Stories begin to circulate about a young woman working at the monastery who went missing a few years earlier, and there is the matter of the church being desecrated and a precious relic stolen.

It seems that the longer Shardlake stays, the more complex the mystery gets. What is truth and what is being made up to continue a way of life that may not be in the best interests of society? How much of the terror in London is real and how much was Cromwell's creation? Whom can Shardlake trust?

The book was interesting, and it definitely picked up toward the end. However, I can't give it five stars. Perhaps this is my own fault, as I learned that Tudor England doesn't interest me as much as I thought it did. C.J.

The movie occasionally silly with some goofy moments, especially in the end involving a plane and a motorcycle. Despite that though the film is always entertaining. Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Watchmen, Supernatural seasons 1-2) probably would have made a better Hannibal than Liam Neeson in the upcoming A-Team movie and he shows why in the Losers by shining in a similar role.

I also liked Chris Evans and I think he was surprisingly better here in a cocky and talkative role than he was in the Fantastic Four movies. He's more entertaining in the Losers than he was in those 2 movies as well. I still don't see him as Captain America though, due to that character being less cocky and goofy than anyone Evans has played. Jason Patric is also in good form as the nutty wisecracking villain.

My only problem with the Losers is that should have ended the story with one movie. It's a good movie, but I don't see sequels happening, especially due to the not so great Box Office performance.

I do like the option of looping the handles onto the bands as opposed to each band having it's own handles.  I like that the 10 lb and 15 lb bands can be combined for 25 lb.  I really like the included door attachment!  I wasn't sure at first but it was easy to use and increased the number of exercises you are able to do.  I did not see any damage to my door after using it for several days.  I'm tall so I had no problems putting the door attachment at the top of the door, if you are short I'm sure you will. It took me a bit to get used to having so much 'handle' on the bands- it's approximately 20"" on each side of the webbed band attached to the rubber band, then you add the handle section with it's own length of webbing... this makes the resistance band a total of 80"" long, with 40"" being rubber and 40"" being that flat webbed ribbon ( not sure what it's called) and the handle.  Even though I'm tall, I found that I had to widen my stance when securing the band with my feet in order to get enough resistance.  I didn't feel as though I was truly getting 10 or 15  lb resistance.
The other set of bands I have is by Giam.  The total length of those bands is 56"" including the handles - 24"" shorter than these bands. I feel the resistance much more on those bands.  I had a friend try these, she's about 5'6"" and these were too long for her to get an effective workout.  When we set up the door stopper she was halfway across the room before getting resistance.

It's based on two groups of super beings, of the comic book lore, one good and one evil. Our heroine is part shadow and part light, she must decide which direction she will take. Staying a mortal being with an average life is not an option anymore.
The story keeps you engaged with it's comic book scenarios, good guys and bad guys, and our heroine isn't annoyingly stupid, as some heroines tend to be, in novels of this genere.  She's clever and cunning, thrust into a world she never asked for. Seems to be a good start for the series.",4,"[-0.9308372401321297, -1.2491099082457047, -1.2242743670929996, -1.0174571394092784, -1.6042324511444768]",-0.9308372401321297

Cynthia Eden does these company-rescue-falls-for-client books well...

But then again, it kind of makes me fear that she's writing a little niche for herself and outside of her paranormal world, the only books she's going to write are just that: company-rescue-falls-for-client, and after a while, there are only so many story lines that you can do on that point.

Regardless, she did a very good job with BROKEN.

Going into this story, I knew that I was going to like it. Everything about the synopsis pulled me in.

When Eve showed up at Gabe's office, he was attracted to the woman. However, her claiming to possibly be Jessica Montgomery made him put up some walls. With the disappearance of Jessica, the Montgomery family had put aside a large sum of money. Understandably he needed to know for sure that she was indeed Jessica before they made that claim.

Gabe's biggest problem though was his attraction. The first few days he was constantly reminding himself that she was a client. However Eve is also drawn to Gabe, and she's certain she had not felt that way before.

Gabe is understandably and slightly possessive man. Part of that is his history as a seal, but part of that is his history has a whole. Gabe and Wade's friendship is rock solid and as such, I'm extremely excited to read Wade's book. While Gabe's sister isn't around anymore, I'm sure that he has some harboring feelings that deal with her.

I enjoyed watching Gabe fight his attraction, and then deal with his protectiveness, over Eve. Also, I liked the way Cynthia wrote Eve's character -- how she slowly regained her memories and that they scared her. However, there was s scene or two where I felt she was too pouty.

This was well written, the audience and dreams done well and not overly dramatic, and certainly makes me excited to see where else Cynthia brings us in the world of LOST.",4,"[-2.6124878155153537, -1.8538103993702837, -0.931136020679622, -1.0155568854391657, -1.2115915500674885]",-0.931136020679622

3440,"This was my first political read and I must say that I enjoyed it very much.  The author played the series out exactly what you might see on television.  I enjoyed it very much and give it 4 stars.  4 stars because some of the situations happening in the third book got a little redundant.  I kind of got bored.  The first and second book had a different vibe which was good.  I almost hated Liz in the second book for some of the things she did.
Liz and Brady were a great couple.  They were so in love and had to keep it secret because of his political career and her being a student at Chapel Hill.  I loved that the author made Liz a strong lead, female character.  Liz had her own career and goals.  Brady was a dynamic up and coming young politician.  Their chemistry was intense.
The author provided great secondary characters for her books that played important roles to the storyline.  Being from North Carolina, I was familiar with some of the hot spots in the Chapel Hill area.  I would have loved to hear a little more ""twang"".  I did like when she had some of the characters saying ""ya'll"".
All in all, I would give this series a 4 star rating.  It was a great political story of love, misunderstandings, heart break and redemption.  The life of a political reporter and politician are spelled out and it can be quite ruthless.  I would have loved to have seen more of the political side with Brady and some of the things he had to deal with throughout the story instead of everything focused on the female character.  Great series, highly recommend.",3,"[-3.3973777375201166, -1.8085725451352674, -0.9312507939869809, -0.9773370927295146, -1.5426247283939674]",-0.9312507939869809

Colbie is a successful author whose first breakout novel is slated to be on a big screen soon. She would prefer people didn't know this though and tends to hide who she is from people, including Spencer.

Spencer is your typical playboy bachelor. Rich and sexy in California equals women falling at your feet and the occasional marriage proposal. Spencer isn't all about that though and prefers privacy. The same kind of privacy Colbie craves. When they let down their guards with each other sparks ignite and you're going to need a fan to keep cool. Jill always writes sexy, steamy scenes, but entwined in them are the reasons why the two characters are broken and need the other to find their way back to happiness. Both Colbie and Spencer learn about themselves as they learn about each other, and they both decide theyve focused on their work and their past for too long.

1135,"After ""The Caves of Steel"" and ""The Naked Sun"", ""The Robots of Dawn"" is the third and final murder mystery pairing the duo of the agoraphobic Earth detective Elijah Bailey with his humaniform robot partner, R. Daneel Olivaw.

In ""The Robots of Dawn"", the detectives run into yet another seemingly impossible mystery, but this time the mystery is not that the murder seemed impossible for anyone to have committed, but seems impossible for one man to have NOT committed, even though that man seems incapable of murder. The mystery is set on the capitol of the Spacer worlds, Aurora. Although the society on Aurora is much more normal than the skewed and unhealthy psychology in ""The Naked Sun"", the spacer residents are still not too happy about being in contact with a ""dirty, germ ridden Earthman"" ... although most are polite about it.

Asimov ends the book with an action and a concept that knocks long time readers of his robots novels on their respective ears. When I put this book down I turned to my wife and said ""That's the best book I've ever read. It might be the best book ever"". I'm sure I was caught up in the moment, but that was how profoundly I was affected by the events and the single important concept that wrapped parts of this mystery up. You'll remember R.

2167,"This is the first book by Thomas Perry I have read that has not been a part of his Jane Whitefield series. Although the main character is very different as well as the tone of the book, the same great writing I've enjoyed in other books is evident in this book featuring Jack Till, a retired LAPD homicide detective who is now a private eye. ""The Boyfriend"" has a unique plot and most of the characters and events seem realistic, although a few of the plot twists require the reader to suspend disbelief and move on.

Jack Till is an interesting main character. He's a tough guy with a soft spot for those in need and especially for his daughter Holly who has Down's Syndrome. Their relationship shows a different side of Jack and shows a nice contrast to Jack when he is on the job. The job in this book is trying to track down an apparent serial killer targeting high-priced female escorts. Many chapters are told from the point of view of the killer and he is creepy, scary, and violent, and amoral. In spite of all that, although I can't say I sympathized with him, I didn't find him to be evil.

One problem I had with the story is I didn't care for Sharon, one of the characters involved near the end of the book. This young woman was a student and although she was in a dangerous situation, I didn't relate to her as well as I did the call girls in the earlier parts of the book. They were more likeable and honest than Sharon, so that lessened the impact of the ending for me. I also felt like the book was very suspenseful, but then after the big build-up, the ending needed more drama and was a bit of a let-down. I would read additional Jack Till books if the series continues because I did enjoy most of the book.

452,"Reading Anthony Trollope is like chatting with a good-hearted gossipy old friend who tells you of all the goings on of his neighbors without once being snippy or sarcastic or even overly condemnatory of those who misbehave. He gives you hints right off that his stories end happily, so you are not held in suspense as to the outcome, but the charm is in hearing the details of how it all comes about. He is a welcome reprieve when you wish to slow down and believe once again that people, despite all their faults, are mostly decent, and that sometimes, despite all the odds, things do end up as they should.

For those familiar with Victorian literature, I would say that he is less sharp and bitter than Thackery, less melodramatic and prone to painting in black and white than Dickens, less passionate and personal than the Bronte sisters. He is humorous without lapsing into farce, critical of certain aspects of the society of his time without being a crusader, and altogether a very pleasurable friend to have.

This novel is #3 in Trollope's Chronicles of Barsetshire series and tells the story of the titular doctor and his niece Mary. Despite her poverty and questionable parentage, she is the beloved of Frank Gresham, the heir to a large estate.

Will May reject him because she feels her ""blood"" is inferior to his? Will they marry and live in poverty and ignominy? Will Mary ever receive her rightful inheritance?

My 1st from this author and I was not disappointed. I greatly enjoyed this book and how it deals with mental health. Its like any quality of a person, it is a apart of the individual and should not be viewed in a negative way. I was glad to see that Orlando was aware of his use of medication and how he attempted to better his life even with the dramatic change to his life. And his relationship with Geoff was wonderful but what was interesting to see is that Orlando was aware of how their relationship could be turning into codependency like Geoff's past relationship. Even though it broke my heart at the breakup scene after Orlando received devastating news about his daughter's mother, I think it was necessary for both Orlando and Geoff to take some time apart to reevaluate their lives as individuals and as couple before deciding if they wanted to go further with the connection between them.

The narrative flowed as fast as the river, and as deep as a river can sometimes be.
Although it was a fast paced and captivating novel, it is not a suspense novel, nor is it a romance as such. I felt throughout the story that I was right there, watching with five year old Gabriel as his father John left him to go down the bank to help a kayaker in distress. I was with him as he withdrew into himself on his 'bad' days and exalted with his mother, Maggie, when he was able to reach out to join in with others in their activities. The sand between his toes, the warm breeze over the river and the cry of the albino red tailed hawk were as real to me as if I had actually been there at the river with Gabe.  And though I am not fond of the river, and just thinking about riding the rapids turns my knees to mush,  I  will never think of them in quite the same way.
How will this novel impact my life? Hopefully when an opportunity to do something different and out of my comfort zone comes my way, I will not let fear or lack of confidence in my abilities keep me from reaching for a more fulfilling life.
I will be thinking of Gabriel Clarke as an intimate friend of mine, wondering how his life is turning out...so, Michael, I hope you will keep me in the loop.

6749,"Break Even is one INTENSE read. I started reading it around 1 am because I couldn't sleep, then I couldn't sleep because I started reading it. From the book synopsis we know we are meeting a woman feeling ignored and enduring the odd ugly kind of hurt that neglect generates, and then suddenly she seems to be smack down in the middle of a battle. It's her will against her new clients or perhaps something and someone else at play?

From the go I had sympathy for Marley and although the story centers around infidelity, I completely understood why she'd allow herself to go there. So I gave her my own emotional hall pass. It really couldn't be helped because Lisa creates such a powerful connection between Marley and River that there was no way to not want that for her. Rooting for them made sense and the intimacy was written so well. Yes, its a very sexy story! Left to their own devices, these two just had that kind of chemistry.

At first River just seems like a pesky customer with a normal attraction to a beautiful woman. He senses an opening (and a challenge) so naturally he is relentless. But damn if he wasn't romantic and surprisingly genuine in the attention he pays to Marley. For her part, Marley is conflicted.

1678,"At first sight, Shopgirl is an intimate portrait on a small canvas. But the vision of the artist enlarges in ever-broadening strokes. Martin's characters are vivid, alive, even though some are shallow and misguided. He breathes animation into each, as if this writer has temporarily inhabited that ""self"" long enough to realize an accurate portrayal. What I most appreciate: this novella opens a door that I can enter, experience, then leave, confident in the truth distilled from each individual. Reading Shopgirl, I had the sense that this author sees the world as I do, observant, yet unencumbered by the need for judgment.
Some of the phrasing is idiosyncratic: ""the smell of Thanksgiving is in the air, which means that Christmas is in the oven."" Other passages are striking for their insight into male/female behavior: (her)""...everytime she sacrifices a bit of herself, she gives him a little more of her that her cannot give back."" And (him)""...not understanding that what he is taking from her is torn from her, believes that the arrangement is fair.""

2135,"I have loved all of Suzanne Woods Fisher's books, so was not surprised in the least , that this new one had everything that I believe a great novel should have! ""The Newcomer"" is the second in a series of three, entitled ""Amish Beginnings"". It is fabulous sequel to ""Anna's Crossings"", book one.

The setting was described in such a realistic, detailed way , that I felt that I was living in this strange land, speaking a language very different from most other residents. The time frame of the 1700's was fitting for the newcomers. The rules and laws seem to be very different from what they are used to, making them fearful of what will happen next.

The characters are practical people who strive to make new lives for themselves under the most difficult circumstances. At once, I was able to identify with their problems, challenges and fears. Their uncertainty in this new land was felt deeply within as they encountered problems that seemed insurmountable. Losing their leader unexpectedly , was an experience that threw them into a complete panic. One of my favorite characters was a young lad named Felix,  a most adventuresome boy, who constantly seemed to find trouble, while at the same time , discovered important and valuable information. All of the characters were described in such detail that they became my friends, as I walked alongside them in their rocky journey.

Although I am not a great fan of historical fiction, Suzanne writes in such a way that I learn as I enjoy the plot. There are constantly unexpected twists and turns that keep the reader engaged from beginning to end of the novel. The plot progresses steadily and quickly. I must say, that I NEVER was prepared for the next bump in the road as these immigrants fought to find a home in this strange, new country.

This author has never failed in writing a book that amazes me! She keeps a reader totally enthralled from beginning to end of the book.

Definitely a five star book! I am impatiently waiting for the concluding book in this series!

Written by Kenneth Oppel
. . . . .

This story an unsettling, kind of creepy first-person narrative told from the point of view of a kid with anxiety-producing obsessive compulsive disorder and ADD or some similar spectrum disorder, who is dealing with having a new sibling as well as his own various issues and medications. He's having what seems to be delusional conversations with ""angels"" tied to a health problem that has sent his younger sibling to the hospital and made his parents even more preoccupied than ever. It's a far cry from author Kenneth Oppel's robust action adventures in books such as ""Airborn"" and ""The Boundless"", or the fantasy world of the Silverwing series... Oppel brings considerable powers as a writer to bear here, but this story (which is short, basically a novella) is a little creepy and unnerving, and may require a little vetting on the part of parents.

1894,"Maddie Kosloski lost a high powered job and finds herself back in the small (fictional) central valley town where she grew up. She reconnects with her family and with a couple of glamorous girlfriends, and these people -- plus a couple of handsome guys and a few fellow townspeople I hope we'll see developed more in the future of the series -- are the center of the story.

The people, that is, and the place: a museum of the paranormal that Maddie finds herself at first grudgingly caring for to help a friend, but which becomes an important part of her life in the course of the book. Is it haunted? Is it possible to make it pay? Can Maddie overcome the powerful women's group lobbying against it -- and the fact that there was a murder committed there?

In a way, this book feels like a pilot for the series, laying down the basic story to get ready for more mysteries to come. We get why Maddie and her wealthy fashionista friends are in a small town near Sacramento, we see how artifacts in the museum can provide mysteries for Maddie to solve (in this book, the mystery from the past is more intriguing than the one in the present), we understand the personal issues that will give Maddie plenty to think about and worry over for books to come, and we are introduced to the Paranormal Museum which will doubtless flourish in the future.

The town is charming in its own way, the characters are both quirky and convincing, and I'm looking forward to more about Maddie and her museum.",4,"[-1.9099462166514645, -0.9396443467963946, -1.2893938038906578, -1.040380091589845, -0.9373491242459887]",-0.9373491242459887

I learnt a lot that while reading this book, such as, the presidential election in America and Volleyball. I have not previously read any sport romances that were about volleyball and I found that I really enjoyed reading about this sports. There were some sensitive issues that were discussed within the story in a sensitive manner and I feel more informed about some of these issues.

I enjoyed both characters Dane and Lucia. Dane was a great guy that I adored from the start. I enjoyed the way that he cared about his family, especially the way that he was there for his mum when she is having a hard time during the race for president. I liked the way that Dane was able to admit his flaws and the way that he tried to learn form his past mistakes. Lucia was a beautiful character that struggled with her body image. I felt for her so much and my heart broke for her when people went out of their way to be mean to her. She was a sweet character and I loved how she cared for her family so much.

Both characters parents are currently running against each other in the presidential campaign. Due to the different beliefs that both characters have results in them not getting along at first. However, soon they both realise the feelings that they have for each other and get together. I enjoyed seeing the way they navigate their relationship despite having different views and beliefs. I enjoyed this book so much and the way it ended has me wanting to read the next book even more.

100,"Although I'd read the book for which author Edith Wharton became the first woman to win the Pulitzer prize (in 1920), I'd never even heard of this book when a friend gave it to me recently. After reading it, my only regret is not having happened upon it sooner.

This short novel (77 pages) would probably be classified as a novella and is as brilliant as it is brief. The book is narrated by a man who spends ""the best part of the winter"" in a small Massachusetts town, due to a work assignment and becomes intrigued with the title character, who, he describes as ""the most striking figure in Starkfield, though he was but the ruin of a man"" because of community members' comments about a ""smash-up."" After enlisting the services of a reticent Ethan Frome for transportation to and from the train station and spending (mostly wordless) time with him, his intrigue only increases. But just when you think you are to be let in on the secret, the author flashes back almost twenty-four years prior to chronologically cover the events that ended up leading to the incident (and taking up three-fourths of the book's pages). It's safe to say (without providing spoilers) that the story is about the interrelationship between a (then) twenty-eight year old man, his thirty-five year old hypochondriac wife of seven years, and the woman's approximately twenty-one year old (first) cousin (once removed). Over the years' time that the young woman lives with and works for the couple, Ethan Frome's feelings for her change from mild resentment (being tasked with chaperoning her to and from social engagements in town) to daydream-inducing romanticism. Once again, the denouement seems imminent, but instead the reader is brought back to the present to learn, along with the narrator, the result of Mr. Frome's actions. The back cover calls the ending, ""both shocking and savagely ironic."" I agree.

Wharton's perfectly descriptive writing, character development and plotting make this one of my favorite books of the year.

58,"In a previous review I had wished Cornwall would mix up the formula of his Sharpe series, proving the French proverb correct--I didn't at all enjoy getting what I wished for. Sharpe's Trafalgar is a hybrid novel of unlikely Romance and unlikely happenstance adventure wherein we are asked to suspend our disbelief that an army officer just happens to stumble upon the greatest naval battle since Actium.  I did so grudgingly.  After all can't Cornwall come up with his own interesting premises to drive a plot--or will we have Sharpe ricocheting across Europe in the Napoleonic Wars.

Not only does our hero stumble into the battle  at Trafalgar but he is introduced to Nelson who (naturally) takes a shine to Sharpe offering sage advice about being unnecessarily modest.  Sadly, this is the plausible part of our tale with a seedy and wholly unconvincing affair between a baroness and the ensign taking center stage.  Apparently aristocrats in the 19th century risked all--wealth, status and comfort for a roll in the hay. Why?  They are bored. And realize how disagreeable an arranged marriage can be.

Even if one assumes the Lady Grace is indifferent to class mores and proprieties, are we supposed to believe she is too horny to restrain herself in a venue that all but ensures discovery. Does it bother her 19th century sensibilities that she is an adulterous? Of course not. That her lover commits murder to silence blackmail?  Whatever.  It is all too absurd for words.  Cornwall's strength was never character development but surely an editor could have pointed out that 21st century morality is inappropriate in a story taking place 200 years ago.  I have no doubt adultery happened. I also have no doubt it didn't happen as described in ST.

What saves this from being a silly stinker is the genuinely interesting description of 19th century naval tactics and life above and below deck.  The battle of Trafalgar is rousing and the devotion Nelson inspires is well done. However, Cornwall seems to have ventured into the realm of romance with this one, and that isn't, in my opinion, a good thing.",2,"[-1.5703492357960551, -0.9379826471269085, -1.1271662256595476, -1.0315785947772949, -1.087534302092491]",-0.9379826471269085

Karma will always come back and bite you on the butt. For Lauren (and Natasha) this is certainly the case. Whether their crimes deserved this treatment is for you to decide. Lauren is captured and held captive, used and abused by the delightful members of the Devil's Spawn MC. These men are sick and sadistic and completely deluded about themselves. It is, though, the traits that kept getting Lauren in trouble that gets her through the sickening ordeal.

When they are rescued by a rival group, we see a complete contrast between the two. The Kings of Rebellion immediately embrace her as family and she beings to get life back again.

Lauren grows as a woman throughout and is completely different to how she was at the start. She is still strong and confident but has turned it to use in a positive way. This was an interesting read: a roller coaster of a ride that I still feel as though I'm on.

The book starts out at Day 1 and then changes to two weeks before and counts backward from Day 15.  Its a little bit confusing, but that only adds to the confusion surrounding the mystery.

The story opens with Nicolette Farrell returning home to Cooley Ridge.  Her father is not doing well and her brother wants to sell the home.  What really spurs Nic to visit though is a hastily scrawled note from her father saying that he has seen the girl.

The girl.  Nic knows that he is most likely talking about Corinne.  Corinne who disappeared one night when Nic and her friends were 18.  They had been at a carnival, there had been a fight and Corinne went missing.

I would not suggest these toys for kids much younger than this due to the darts being plastic and they come out fast and hard when they hit.
It does come with a small target that you can use with it. We actually went out to the store to get the BIG target for them to play with though the do prefer to just play games that do not include using the targets. If you do use the targets these darts will stick to them so is easy to keep score.

I love this authors writing style. I was captured by the blurb anything to do with werewolves and vampires you know it is probably going to be a good book.
I was not disappoint I literally stayed glued to my kindle reading about Mena and what was going on. You start the story off strong! My only thing after getting through the book and I do hope that maybe this author writes it in the next book is how did Mena not know anything was different in her life. I mean 12 years with someone and you didn't notice anything? I am not talking about the secret that comes to light the first few pages I am talking about the secret that comes out later on when Mena meets Jaxson.
This story really takes off and keeps going there isn't a dull moment at all. I can only imagine what the other book or books will be like. Especially with Mena not being human anymore.
The characters are strong, they do pique your interest to where you are going to want more or at least I know I did.
I don't want to give anything away just know that if you want vampires and werewolves and the chance to have a strong female character (which I am hoping for) than you will have to get a copy!!!",3,"[-1.4967738776800652, -1.1464755889732823, -1.1104321280596947, -1.0186242546687938, -0.940419104494379]",-0.940419104494379

Olivia and Cash are having a very intense ""secret"" relationship. Cash is still doubling up as himself and his dead twin Nash; Olivia does not want him to risk his secret for her and telling the world they are together. Their very intense, erotic (super hot) relationship gets put on hold when the Russian mob is after Cash and the books his father has on them showing their guilty of crimes. If you don't remember from Down To You, Cash is pretending to be his dead twin Nash AND himself in order to help free his father from prison from a crime he did not commit. Now the mob is after Cash and the woman in his life Olivia. Cash must save Olivia and not give up the only leverage he has on the mob to help free his father.

Up To Me is written in dual POV's between Cash and Olivia. I love when books do this and I can understand both the main characters and their feelings toward each other. They have some very hot and sexy love scenes but the action scenes take over the book about 60% in. That is also when I found the book to not be AS entertaining as the first half. I enjoyed reading about Olivia and Cash more so then the mob storyline. I also really enjoyed that the two main characters weren't ""I love you"" every other line. It took both characters awhile to admit their feelings and felt this was more realistic then some books I have read where the two leads fall quickly for one another. It made it even better when that moment finally came about.

I would have given Up To Me 5 stars if I didn't find the last 40% of the book to be not as exciting as the first 60%. I was totally digging on Gavin; a friend of Cash's who comes to the rescue. I am a bit disappointed he doesn't have his own book (at least not yet) but I highly doubt fans of The Bad Boy series will be disappointed with who is the male lead in book three.

I enjoyed this book, once I got about 20% into it. I thought a lot of the opening, the dislike of Brett with his other family members and the reason Alisha was involved in a fake engagement were handled rather quickly and in more of a ""tell the reader how they should feel"" instead of letting the reader make the discovery on their own.

This is not uncommon in the first in a series. Once we got to the relationship with Brett and Alisha, the book really gained it's footing. Brett and Alisha had wonderful chemistry and, even though you are told he is cold and a jerk, I never really got the impression of him that I was supposed to. Yes, he was work focused, but definitely not cold. And, I think this is how Alisha sees him as she gets to know him.

I liked that even though the engagement was fake, both Alisha and Brett were loyal to her engagement and kept things between them to a mostly unacknowledged upon attraction until there was no longer the issue with the engagement between them. Brett does go to a fairly extreme length to put them into the same place so they can work toward their relationship, but it is in character so it works.

I do recommend this book, and I think it was a good beginning to a new series. I am looking forward to the next title.",3,"[-1.5409363856369587, -1.6501548769190364, -0.942321049922248, -1.0146064572075286, -1.4775733035061216]",-0.942321049922248

47,"""No matter what he does, every person on earth plays a central role in the history of the world. And normally he doesn't know it.""

For years, friends have been telling me about ""The Alchemist"", saying that they not only enjoyed the book, but that it was one of the best they'd ever read. It took me a long time to finally read it, but I'm inclined to agree with them. Though it's very short (my paperback is 167 pages), it's deeply profound, touching, and beautiful.

The story is that of a shepherd boy named Santiago who lives in southern Spain. After he has a dream of a treasure to be found in the Pyramids of Egypt, he is visited by a king who persuades him to sell his sheep in order to fulfill his dream. The boy sails to Algeria, where he faces many setbacks on the way to Egypt, before finally arriving, only to find out that his dream is, in fact, slightly different than what he had originally imagined.

While the plot sounds simple, this is a story where the journey is truly more important than the destination. Along the way, the boy meets many people who help him achieve his dream, who persuade him, rob him, help him, and teach him. Each one of them plays a vital role, and without any one of them, his story may have turned out much more different.

Like so many profound stories, this is about more than the tale on the page. It's about our fears, our dreams, the choices we make, and the consequences of our actions. It is about how each object in the world is connected, and how everyone we meet helps us learn a lesson we could not have learned in any other way. Even translated from the original Portuguese, Paulo Coelho's prose is simply gorgeous, and this book is one everyone should read.",4,"[-2.8059466197586787, -1.6756967948706174, -1.125004369890792, -1.0375898893591753, -0.942956068065268]",-0.942956068065268

I don't want to waste space here repeating what so many other 5-star reviewers  have already said so well.  But I did want to jump in and say why I can't agree with the Newsday blurb at the top of the paperback jacket which advises newbies to start with this fifth novel in the series and work their way back...because this one ""shows Maisie at the top of her detecting form.""

No question about it, Maisie is definitely ""at the top of her detecting form"" in ""An Incomplete Revenge."" But I'd recommend starting with book one, ""Maisie Dobbs."" Why? Because this series concerns itself at least as much with the connectedness and  personal trajectories of its continuing characters--Maisie, Frankie, the Beals, the Comptons,  Simon,  Priscilla, Maurice, Stratton et al--and its setting (England itself in the years between the wars) as it does with the case at hand and the detective work involved. If, after sampling book one, you find that you're more interested in the cases than the characters,  then fine, bypass books 2-4,  ""Birds of a Feather,"" ""Pardonable Lies"" and ""Messenger of Truth"" and jump straight into this one; it's a great read indeed.

Please, please, please read Savage Collision (Book 1) first. This is one of those series that you really want to read in order. Also, please note that in my first review I said Savage was my new book boyfriend, well Ive moved on. Gabe Anderson is now my book boyfriend (Sorry Savage).

Skye Hawke has had some tragedy in her life and has worked like the dickens to overcome and move on. Its not easy and everyone looks at her just a little differently. Skye is a grown woman who still has some bratty tendencies. She is a professional in the work place and is still trying to find her new place in her family. Her new reality is a little hard for her to take sometimes because of guilt and part of her soul being missing.

Gabe understands about soul connections because he and her brother Savage have a similar connection. Herein lies the problem. Skye is Gabes best friends little sister. Ruh roh - you see where this is going, right? Gabe served several tours of duty, suffers from PTSD as well as a few other issues and tries really hard to work on himself and move on in his life. He knows right from wrong and struggles with decisions.

I was so excited to read this book. I just knew there was a story behind Gabe and what makes him tick. I was not disappointed in even one page of this story.

Amish Romance

This is a quick, yet fascinating read with all the ingredients to make this an enjoyable time spent with friends among the Amish. By writing in the first person point of view with vivid imagery the reader is immediately immersed in the life of Sally as she travels to a town with a ridiculous name to help a young girl who has been emailing with her for some time. What she finds there is a surprise both to her and the reader, and it is not just the fact that it is a completely different culture than where she lives with her used-car-salesman father.  Just what was the motive of young Lizzie? This is one novel I hope there will be a sequel for, as there was a thread left untied. This book is definitely a stand alone book, not at all the kind where you wish you had not read because you need to buy the next one to enjoy. It is just that inquiring minds need to know!

While with the Shakers murder starts to surround the peaceful community which sheds a cloud over her but the Sheriff who likes Carolyn wants to find the true killer.  This book was very interesting as I did not know much about the Shaker religion.  I was worried that it would have been more of a romance novel but it wasn't.  It really more about Carolyn coming to terms with her relationship with Christ and coming to terms with may have happened to her husband in the Civil War.  I think I was most interested in how the Shaker's were.  I had no idea on their false belief it was a very informative book even though it was a fiction book.  The author really did her research on their beliefs.  The characters in the story we very interesting my only problem was I would have like a little more history on some of the side characters.

842,"The Lincoln Lawyer appears to be the first in a new series - or at least a recurring character - for this author, of whom I am a big fan. The new protagonist, Mickey Haller, is a criminal defense lawyer that in many ways fits the sleazy stereotype - the guilt or innocence of his client is irrelevant as long as he or she can pay Mickey's fee. Haller works either in the court-room or from his Lincoln Town Car because time is money.

Mickey has sources and schemes working all over town to draw in clients and he is always on the look-out for the franchise client; one who is able and willing to pay whatever his defense will cost. Mickey is twice divorced - but yet both of his ""exes"" still like him and in fact one works for him. Haller is also the very absent father of a darling daughter - who misses her Daddy.

Early on in the book Haller lands a ""franchise client"" with deep pockets and a slam dunk case. The plot thickens though as this current case ties into Mickey's past. He soon begins to question his current client's innocence, while second guessing his defense of a previous client - which he may have mishandled - who is now serving a life sentence without parole for a crime - it now dawns on Mickey, he may not have committed.

Haller is not accustomed to such self-reflection, let alone caring about his clients' culpability - but with each twist and turn Mickey's franchise client - even with all his money - becomes a bargain with the devil.

Sounds simple - or at least predictable - but in this author's hands that's just the beginning.

As Connelly's books are character driven - with such complex protagonists as Harry Bosch and Terry McCaleb - Haller as the sleazy lawyer, i.e. a predictable character, could prove to be a handicap.

8803,"It's a cute short story about a young lady who desperately needed to sell her romance novel to a publisher to have enough money to take care of her sister lung disease and to escape a future 'inconvenience' of marriage for her.
Cecelia and Mary have been orphaned two years ago when their parents died in a carriage accident. The only relatives who agreed to keep them were the horrible Uncle Herbert and Aunt Selene. In fact, they were completely bankrupt and wanted to get their hands on Cecelia's dowry, for it made her marry their son, Percy.

Cecelia had aspiration to be a writer and, as Jane Austen, sell her novels and live to have enough money for her and her sister live in countryside, and years ahead to pay for her sister presentation of the ton.
But her meeting was failure, and when she got out of there completely desolate and distracted, she ends up being hit by a carriage, falls down and gets knocked out.
Cecelia is saved by a gentleman who saw everything, taking her to his brother house, Derek Hunt, the Duke of Claringdon.

It turns out that when Cecelia wakes she didn't know who she was, or rather she thought to be the character of her book, Lady Magnolia Makepiece, daughter of the Earl of Markwood, and betrothed with Duke of Loveridge. And to make matters worse, she thinks her rescuer, Adam Hunt, was Loveridge himself.

Now Adam needs to find out who she was and why she told him she was in danger.

Cecilie, or Maggie, would have much to explain to Adam, but the most important is that in such a short time she managed to make him see a purpose in life and with it, he could have what many men crave and that not even money and title may buy ...

It has been a tough year for Tricia but she is looking forward to this cruise.

I was more than pleasantly surprised by this book, #5 in Harris' ""Vampire"" mystery series about Sookie Stackhouse, a ""gifted"" waitress with a penchant for danger and deadly (or should I say, dead) men.

Gothic appeal aside, this book was full of interesting characters, inventive plot twists, and out-of-the-ordinary occurrences -- including an Elvis sighting. I love an author who creates a world and pulls the reader into it completely, and Harris does that here.

652,"Even if P.J. O'Rourke hadn't been among those offering ""advanced praise"" for ""The Taliban Shuffle"", I would be invoking his name in this review. Kim Barker's chronicle of her time as a foreign correspondent in Afghanistan and Pakistan is funny, insightful, ironic and informative. She views the many challenges in this region through an ironic lens while offering detailed insight into the challenges facing the natives *and* the foreigners attempting to influence the outcomes in Afghanistan.

In parallel, she presents a personal narrative of the addictive nature of life in a hostile environment (and especially where the hostility is amplified by language and gender barriers).

Barker's travels took her to some of Afghanistan's toughest neighborhoods without previous expertise before her arrival. She clearly gets the complexities of the ethnic and tribal relationships that dominate life there, and understands too the often absurd outcomes from multinational aid and military organizations.

Her discussions of these offer an accessible and readable recent history of events if Afghanistan. While this doesn't reduce the complexity of trying to understand the region, it does make it more palatable (and I was reminded very much of P.J. O'Rourke's 1990's parsing of the ethnic layout in the Balkans).

Whilst Jay is very smooth and reduces her insecurities in private, his public persona leaves her confused and irritated.

.
Sarah and Sammi were best friends as young girls, but like many close friendships time and distance had the being more acquaintances than friends. Both had left Cherringham with no intention of ever returning.  Then Sarah's husband's infidelity tore her and their children's world apart and they returned to her home town, but as far as she knew Sammi was still living the wild life far away.  Then her body is found caught in the weir (a dam built across a river to regulate the flow of water, divert it or change its level).  Sarah doesn't buy the police's verdict of accidental death.  That leaves murder or suicide and since Sammi always lived life to its fullest Sarah is convinced it was Murder and goes to see the gruff American retired police detective living on the river.  Jack Brennan, former NYC detective and widower.  He came to Cherringham for the tranquility and slower pace, but found he missed the excitement of the chase police work brought him.  The two team up to find out exactly how Sammi died and why.

Murder on Thames my be a short read but it is chock full of mystery and intrigue.  The main characters are believable.  I can see Jack as the dour widower with little time for social niceties and Sarah trying to rebuild a life for her and her children with cool English stoicism.  The two make a strange pair, but complement each other.  The story is filled with twist and turns.

It makes Belgian style waffles, so you will basically get an inch and a half thick, ten inch diameter, fluffy waffle each time. Well, at least you will if you prepare tha batter properly. We don't use the recipe included, because we are Vegan, but our dairy free recipe works great in this iron. It is super easy to clean, heats up and cooks quickly, and doesnt take up much space. The only possible negative i could see is that you can obviously only make one waffle at a time, lol. However, isn't that always the case with a flip over? If you like waffles and are looking for a decent iron, you could do far worse than to try this one, and for irregular (like once a week for example) personal use, i would say this is perfect.

736,"Jeffrey Archer is a well-established English author, who has written such bestsellers as Kane and Abel and Honor Among Thieves, but his latest addition to the publishing world, Sons of Fortune, fails in many ways; maybe it is because he wrote it under the duress of incarceration?

For about a year now Archer has spent his time in prison because he was essentially embezzling money as a member of the House of Lords.  In that time he has written and produced a play pleading his innocence, and has written this book.  It is about two brothers (as many of Archer's books are), but they do not know they are brothers, separated at birth due to the apparent stupidity and gullibility of the medical industry, as well as the necessity of one nurse to look good.  The result is these two brothers aspire to be politicians and eventually run for governor against each other, even though they are unaware that they are twins.

And this thin and coincidence-filled plot is not all that is wrong with this book.  The two characters simply excel in every possible way: doing great at school, getting the girls they want, getting the positions they want, and getting recognized for their brilliance, to the extent that it becomes sickening.

Sons of Fortune is a book that deserves to be set with the likes of those written by Danielle Steel and James Patterson, to be read by those who seek very little out of a book, but simply to divert themselves from their inane lives.

4442,"DONT WALK AWAY is the third in the DreamMakers series. It is a collaboration of two best-selling authors and is a very sexy read! It is a second chance romance, which I LOVE! Since it is the third in the series, there are characters that reappear from the first two books, but they are more of a distraction, than anything. It can be read as a stand-alone.

Former Army Ranger Dean Colter was a one-woman kind of guy until he tore Emma Lees heart apart. He left her when he was nineteen and they haven't seen each other in eleven years. Now hes pretty much a manwhore, but he never really got over Emma, his first love. When he runs into her at a Halloween party, all bets are off. This is his second chance with her and he is NOT going to blow it. The problem? Emma won't trust Dean with her heart again. He broke it once. Why give him a second shot at it? She is interested in a short-term fling only. He is interested in making her fall in love with him again. Lets see how this is going to play out!

This is definitely a steamy read. Dean and Emma have  grown up while theyve been apart, and are both very successful entrepreneurs and have definitely matured sexually. Hold on to your seat and get ready for the ride! The chemistry between Dean and Emma is explosive. The more time they spend together, Dean realizes that something has been missing in his life, and Emma is making him see it. Emma sees a side of Dean that no one else sees  and it scares her  and messes with her idea of a quick fling.

The authors have a way of getting the reader involved in the story. You feel like you are a part of it. You feel the characters. They take you on an emotional roller coaster ride that you never want to get off of. I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED the story of Dean and Emma, and I think you will, too!

Also, having the US Treasury Secretary running his own clandestine ops is a bit over the top, especially when foreign nationals like the Chinese are involved.

I very much enjoyed Picturing Perfect and I breezed right through it just like the others. Her writing is easy to follow, the chemistry between the hero and heroine is strong, and I like that the pop culture references add humor to the books. This was my least favorite so far of the series only because what I think Brown does so well is the conflict and the ""angst"" and I thought both of those were a bit lacking in this book. While I loved Jason, I thought it was a bit too much that underneath his geeky t-shirts and cute but nerdy sun glasses it is later revealed that he has a ripped muscular body. I would have preferred if he just had a normal guy's lean, toned build as this perfect physique seemed out of character, especially since you never hear him mention the fact that he lifts weights.

He's used to getting what he wants.  He wants Logan and pursues her. She fights it but admits her attraction to him.  Finally she caves to his advances and lets herself explore the physical aspect of being with him.  He's in unchartered territory bc he doesn't do relationships either.  Can they come together?

9256,"The Bicycle Thief is the story of a man (Lamberto Maggiorani) who gets a job as a poster hanger. Jobs are scarce, and he needs this one badly, but it requires that he have a bicycle. Fortunately, he has one, but it is in hock. To get the bike, he pawns some bedclothes and embarks on his job. Halfway through the day, however, a punk kid makes off with his bicycle. The rest of the film is spent desperately searching for the bicycle or any clues that might lead him to it with his son (Enzo Staiola). In true neo-realist fashion, the film does not end where one might expect with the events neatly wrapped up. Director De Sica uses long takes and deep focus to illustrate the ordinary lives of the actors who in fact are non-professionals. There are many memorable scenes, but all of them do not seem important to the central conflict, finding the bicycle. One particularly emotional one is that when the man and his son stop at a restaurant to eat. The boy watches a wealthier family as they eat. His father cannot really afford the meal they are having and is in agony over spending money he does not have, worrying about his bicycle, and trying to enjoy himself.

I would recommend this film if only to hear the way the actors speak. I love the rhythm to the Italian language and find myself enjoying hearing it even if I do not understand what is being said. Just this minor enjoyment can bring some happiness to a rather sad and frustrating story.",3,"[-2.392283278353022, -1.697511237426868, -0.9510215954823094, -1.012989675088578, -1.1520297293284985]",-0.9510215954823094

The story revolves around Adrian attempting to unravel the mystery of Maya's death.  He thought they were happy and trying to have a baby.  Was any of it true?

Gradually, many secrets are revealed.

While I didn't LOVE this book, I did like it a lot.  I especially found it very interesting that all of Adrian's families and children are involved with on another even to the point of vacationing together. I've never seen that happen in real life!

The mystery begins when Adrian decides to find a new home for Maya's cat and posts a note on a bulletin board at the post office.  A woman answers the add (we first learn she watched him post the ad and she takes it with her) but ultimately decides not to adopt the cat.  BUT...she leaves her phone at Adrian's apartment and he tries to find her.

I did think the story weakened near the end and some details were not explained (if Maya left school at 16 how did she become a teacher at a posh girls' school?), but it moves along and is interesting.

I guess the basic theme is ""what goes around comes around.""  Adrian has a lot to learn.",3,"[-2.9288745998270285, -1.541674621894511, -0.952039301168276, -1.0209887601074092, -1.2979642072888913]",-0.952039301168276

The first half kind of drove me crazy. There was so much push and pull which can be exhausting, but its easier to accept when the motivations are strong. I didn't feel that that was the case in John and Tuesdays initial relationship. The reasons for it just didn't seem to be strong enough and often times within mere moments this couple were pushing when they had just been pulling and it was on both their parts. I almost gave up on them because they were really starting to annoy me.

However, once I passed the fifty percent mark, this story took off and I couldn't be happier about the fact that I stuck it out. While I never really connected with Tuesday, I became deeply invested in John. And when he has his epiphany I was in tears.

I get hooked in early (generally in chapter one) and this one was no different. Initially I didn't see Prin as being as strong as some of Taylor's other heroines, and I think she had a further way to go to understand herself, much less Zahir. Even though all her efforts in life were directed on behalf of others, she still believed she was living HER life. Zahir changed all that. She was drawn to him--and it seemed that she unconsciously recognized the 'true him' beneath his outward persona. Getting closer to him seemed to help her see herself more clearly--a good thing for anyone. And after months with Prin, Z was finally able to let himself be the man he was inside.

Ride Hard is the second installment in the Condemned Angels MC series.  Ride Hard wraps up the story of Roxy and Chase and continues the story of Jeremy and Nicole.  More characters are added in this installment which adds to the complexity of the relationship between Jeremy and Nicole.  All the characters are well rounded and interesting.  Jeremy is one hot alpha biker and Nicole is the sweet and sassy girl who grew up with him.  They have history that is complex and dark in nature.  Jeremy is protective of Nicole and wants her to be his but won't let go of his pride long enough to accomplish his goal.  Nicole wants Jeremy but won't put up with any of his crap.  Their pride and stubbornness  makes the story come alive and it moves right along.  Some twists and turns and ups and downs for this couple also moves the story along.  Just like the first installment, I felt this book was more focused on the love story than on the MC.  I did not feel a connection to the MC at all in either installment.

2922,"""Vampire Academy"" is the second novel written by Seattle-based Richelle Mead.  This time, she takes us back to school--vampire school, to be exact.

The story begins when Vasilissa Dragomir and Rose Hathaway are apprehended by the Vampire Academy's truant squad and returned to school after a runaway attempt.  Lissa, who is a Moroi and a true vampire, is one of the Royals who is close to the vampire throne. Rose, who is a dhampir, is destined to protect her.  Moreover, Rose is bound to Lissa's mind in a way no guardian has been since the days of the saints.  Lissa has a talent that frightened them both into getting away from the school.

Of course, things are different when they return and the once-popular duo are the subject of rumors and character assassination.  Typical high school stuff, only lives are at stake.

""Vampire Academy"" was a great read.  Mead's idea of vampires is slightly different than what I am acquainted with, but she did a great job of explaining how  dhampirs, Morois, and Strigois differ.  Her world and rules were very good, for the most part.  Her characters were people that you wanted to care about and read more about.  My one complaint was that Ms. Mead did not set the scene as well as she did in her first book, ""Succubus Blues.""

A really enjoyable book, a bit short as i managed to read it in one day but Saxon and Tee relationship was fun to read about.

Saxon was Tee's best friends boyfriend until he cheated on her. Now Tee's best friend Lexi is finally one good terms with Saxon and is now seeing a guy named Ryder. Complicated part is Ryder and Saxon are both in the same band that has become really big and have been touring. Tee won't admit that she's attractive to Saxon and seems to still hate him for what he put her best friend through. Saxon wants Tee in a big way and vows to her that he will get her to trust him and break the friend barrier. It is hard with Saxon on the road touring has Tee has to trust him and believe that he does want her and won't cheat on her. It's a battle that gets put to the test on many occasions throughout the book.

I do wish that Saxon had to try a bit harder to get her as it seemed to not last long. I love the suspense of will they, won't they but it sort of didn't take long for her defenses to come down and for her to let him in.

1147,"I must first say that I have only read a couple Moning books and I enjoyed this one a lot. I liked the fact that unlike Laurell K. Hamilton (who sucks)she did not throw sex in there for the sake of sex. My biggest criticism of Hamilton is that sometimes the story gets lost in all the sex for the sake of sex stuff. And the only reason that I am comparing is that they both discuss the Fae, Unseelie and Seelie. Moning was refreshing in that for once folks, an author is building a story. For those who think that Jericho is not romantic, I think they are going to be surprised as the story evolves. I love Jericho in that he is an enigma. We aren't sure what he is, but believe me, when he and Mac finally get together they are going to be something.

Now, on to the review. At first you think the story is simple...girl goes to Dublin to find out who killed her sister. But as the story unfolds, you find that there is more than meets the eye. Yes, Mac finds that the world that she has left in Georgia is larger than she ever imagined, and that her sister had gotten in above her head. But what I liked the most was how Moning, took a girl, who in the opening of the book was sunning by the pool in a bikini, to the woman that we see at the end, killing Unseelie Fae. I liked the evolution of the character and the way the story is told, in flashbacks. No matter what, Mac is determined to find the truth and save the world (maybe) by locating a very bad book.  Now, Jericho who I think is trying a little too hard to act like he doesn't like our fearless heroine, is looked for the same book and would like to use Mac as a ""bloodhound"" of sorts (she can sense things).

As Mac realizes that there are things that go bump in the night (vampires, gray men, and things with multiple mouths that feed on women), she prepares for the ultimate battle between good and evil.

I can't wait for the other Fever novels to be released. I think they will be worth the wait.

The book contains royalty, races of superb fighters, sorcery, religions, monsters, space travel, futuristic weapons, and more.

963,"I know when I pick up one of Danielle Steel's books I am in for a treat.  Precious Gifts was a treat.  This is the tale of Veronique Parker and her family.  She was born into money and had more than enough money....more than enough.  She fell in love with and married Paul Parker.  Maybe at one time he loved her but he was in it for the money.  They had three daughters Timmie, Juliette and Joy.  Paul also had a son Bertie from a later marriage.

Paul lived off his wife lavishly.  He also had a wandering eye and that was what finally did him in.  After eleven years of marriage and three daughters the marriage was over.  Veronique was alone and devoted herself to her daughters.

While on vacation in Italy she met Aidan who saved her from a serious accident. They hit it off right away.  She was older than him but that did not bother either of them.  They spent weeks together sightseeing in Italy and fell in love.  Aidan came from a dirt poor family and background and had a strong dislike for rich people.  He did not know the extent of Veronique's fortune.

She had a home in New York and another in Paris.  She also had her parents estate which she has never sold.  When she took Aidan there with her to see it he was in shock.  He knew she had money but this was beyond anything he imagined.  They came from two different worlds and he wasn't sure it would work between them.

The more time Veronique spent with Aidan the more she realized how selfish her daughters were.  They never called but expected her to be there when they needed her.  As time went on this bothered her more and more.

There is so much that goes on and happens I really don't want to tell you the whole story.  I will say there were times when I really wasn't a fan of Aidan's but he ended up redeeming himself.

From just a little bit of the book's plot, I was eager to get my hands on this novel. It has those qualities to the story structure and characters that set it apart, especially in today's historical fiction genre. I wasn't disappointed.

There is much to love about this book. Ellie is a rookie Pinkerton detective, playing not one, but two operatives. The quirky and funny things that happen to her once she is in disguise, keep the story an element of lighthearted. But there is plenty of serious to go around.

The mystery of the silver mine thieves was well portrayed and even a bit surprising once I found out who the real villains were.

The romance was so sweet! Ellie might have fallen in love, but what happens when the man who loves you...actually loves the woman you've become to solve the mystery? If that doesn't make you want this story nothing else will.

Story was solid. Plot was well founded. The writing was enjoyable. The novel has that star quality about it that makes you want to keep reading. I loved the uniqueness of it all.

Samuel Lake is a Methodist preacher who gets moved around a lot.  So, his daughter, Swan is used to being a preacher's kid and being the new kid in town.  When Samuel is not assigned a new position, the family is forced to move back home to Arkansas with Samuel's mother.

I totally fell into this book and was faced with the dilemma of wanting to reading it quickly and wanting to savor it.  I thought that the characters were well drawn, possibly a smidgen stereotypical, but that only added to the charm.  I had trouble reading parts of it...the cruel treatment of people and animals by one of the characters.  But I've known someone almost exactly like him, and I know people like that exist.

The writing was perfect:

""Add this to the fact that he preached with what some considered undue fervor, frequently thumping the pulpit for emphasis and saying things like ""If you believe that, say 'Amen!'"" when he knew full well that Methodists were trying to give up that sort of thing,""

""Her parents certainly loved God.  Swan did, too, she was sure, even though she ben His rules with some degree of regularity, and prayed only When It Was Important.  She'd never been one to wear God out with small talk.""

The only man within the Brandon empire with a moral compass, Shane Brandon is ready to take his family's business dealings legitimate. His reckless and ruthless brother, Derek wants to keep Brandon Enterprises cemented in lies, deceit, and corruption. But the harder Shane fights to pull the company back into the light, the darker he has to become. Then he meets Emily Stevens, a woman who not only stirs a voracious sexual need in him, but becomes the only thing anchoring him between good and evil.

Emily is consumed by Shane, pushed sexually in ways she never dreamed of, falling deeper into the all-encompassing passion that is this man. She trusts him. He trusts her, but therein lies the danger. Emily has a secret, the very thing that brought her to him in the first place, and that secret that could that destroy them both.

Review:

This first book in the new series by Ms. Jones is full of backstabbing and intrigue all centered around Shane Brandon's family business empire.  Emily gets wrapped up in it when she meets Shane and then goes to work for his father.  Poor Emily gets caught up in all the family drama and wants to help Shane but he keeps pushing her away.  You never know who to trust as you read the story.  Ms. Jones writes some excellent drama that kept me enraptured in this story.  So many forces and lies keep getting in the way of Shane and Emily's love story.  The book is full of sexiness between the couple and when they are not apart are so strong together.

This is actually the first book I have read by this Author and I totally enjoyed her writing and this story.  This is the first book in this new series, so no catching up needed.  I do have to say this has a cliffhanger ending and the next book is not out until next..fair warning given.

6037,"Another fantastic book in this series by the dynamic duo of Carly Phillips and Erika Wilde. Like the other books in the series, it is fun and sexy and so well written. This is Connor Prescott's story and it is so sweet and heartwarming.
Over 3 years ago, Connor & Katie met at the airport in Denver on Valentines Day during a snowstorm and have a hot and steamy one-night stand. They have some serious chemistry, something that doesn't come around all that often. Because Connor is not a one-night stand kind of guy, he plans on convincing Katie in the morning that they should continue seeing each other back in Chicago. There are only two problems with that plan. One, she leaves without saying goodbye and two, they did not exchange last names. She also left with something else she didn't know about at the time.
When she finally finds Connor 3 1/2 years later, and tells him he has a daughter, he reacts exactly how you want him too. He jumps in with both feet and wants to be totally involved with not only his little girl, but with Katie. He hasn't really ever found the connection he had with Katie in their one night together with anyone else. He is such an amazing man and was quite easy to fall in love with. He truly is solid as a rock.
Katie is skeptical of love because of her past with men and her own family. Lucky for her Connor isn't a quitter and doesn't give up on her.

3544,"Publisher's Description:

England, 1817

David Worthington, Duke of Penrose is not happy with the American governess his new wards have arrived with. He especially dislikes his attraction to the insufferable woman, and is anxious for her replacement to arrive.

Meredith Chambers is thrilled when the Dowager Duchess Penrose hires her as her companion. Now she can stay with her beloved charges. But can she ignore how her heart thumps when the pompous duke gets close?

Two people determined to ignore each other despite the pull between them, and the sparks that fly when they're together.

My Thoughts:

This is a sometimes funny, touching and well written novella by Callie Hutton.

Merry comes to England from America as the governess of two young girls who have recently lost their previous governess to an illness that took her life.
After several years employed by the girls parents she becomes the one person left to them after the tragic deaths of both parents. They do however have a guardian and she accompanies the girls to his home only to have him decide she would not make a suitable governess for the girls.
Now she is likely unemployed until his mother steps in and hires her as her companion. What ensues is highjinks and a developing love from a man who has never nor feels he will ever feel such emotions.
This is a well thought out story with well developed characters in spite of the short novel length of this book.
I would give this book 4.5 of 5 stars for storyline and characterization and 3 of 5 flames for heat. Although there is only one sexually physical scene in this story it is quite heated.

1605,"Jonathan Moore follows-up The Poison Artist with an entirely different style, feel and set of characters. He goes from a plot hidden among the hazy fog, to a compelling police procedural. Completely different, but both deliciously dark and proof that this author has range. What felt familiar was Mr. Moores affinity for masking the truth. For making me feel duped in some ways. It seems he never gives up everything all at once. Honestly, is there anything better in a crime thriller?

I don't want to spoil anything from THE POISON ARTIST, so Ill only go so far to say its the SFPD homicide inspectors that loosely connect the two books. Meaning, if you feel like picking this one up without having read TPA - go for it. Having read them back-to-back, I can assure you, this is a true standalone. There are no spoilers or anything that could potentially taint your enjoyment of this book or the first, should you read them out of order.

The opening is compelling and quite morbid. Literally, as Inspector Cain is watching a coffin being exhumed, hes reassigned to work on a case involving photographs of what appears to be a frightened young woman in a compromising situation. The photos tell somewhat of a story, but without the entire set of prints, its hard to guess how things ended for her. The cryptic note that accompanies the photos alludes that the Mayor knows exactly what happened. So the question becomes, why is the Mayor of San Francisco being blackmailed and what isn't he telling Inspector Cain?

Jonathan Moores attention to detail and ability to drag the reader right into the story is phenomenal. I could almost smell the decay of the body being unearthed after thirty years, feel the chill of the air in the morgue as I witnessed the autopsies, conjure up the photographs of the woman so clearly it was as if I was holding them in my own hands and feel myself cringe at the description of gray-red brain tissue. Not every writer has the ability to do that. To completely enthrall a reader in this way. So kudos Mr. Moore.

What at first seems to be a straight forward investigation is anything but. Im talking no holds barred, watch your back, you don't see the twists coming good. Wow . . . and that ending!

Uhtred of Bebbanburg is again the narrator who has reluctantly become dedicated to Alfred the Great's goal of unifying England. But now Alfred is on his deathbed and chaos threatens. The Danes are waiting the right opportunity to invade and their plans are abetted by treachery, lies and a rival claimant for the thrown.

Uhtred had previously sworn loyalty to the king's daughter, AEthelflaed, and assures Alfred he will fight for Wessex. Alfred seeks and ultimately achieves Uhtred's allegiance for his heir, Edward. But there is mistrust between the two and Edward's advisers create delays that threaten the regime and endanger its inhabitants.

As always, Uhtred becomes involved in a variety of adventures which enhance the pace of the novel. In one he falls into the clutches of a sorceress in the employ of his enemies and she predicts the fall of England. Uhtred turns that around by creating his own place of pilgrimage, complete with ""angels"" and predictions meant to draw the Danes into a misstep.

The primary function of historical fiction is to entertain. That does not demand adherence to fact, and Cornwell readily admits Uhtred is his invention and other characters and events have been used to suit his story. The important thing is they be convincing to the reader. Do Shakespeare's dramas adhere to fact? Of course not. But generations of readers have accepted them as such.

Cornwell can't be equaled when it comes to depicting the horror of the battlefield and there's plenty of blood and guts as well as bawdy humor and romance.",3,"[-2.464590268689741, -0.9652866806206998, -1.441418748475071, -1.019588673434202, -1.2785914070451256]",-0.9652866806206998
276,"A wonderfully engaging story of friendship, heartache and second chances.  Sweetest Mistake by Candis Terry is a fun and sexy read and everything I wanted from the Sweet, Texas series!

When Abby Morgan strolls back into town intent on fixing up her parents old house and then moving on with her life, she knows shes going to run into Jackson Wilder, shes just hoping she can keep her distance from her old best friend.  The last thing she wants is for her feelings to show through and for her to get her heart crushedagain.  Easier said than done though.  Jacksons still hot as ever and determined to be in her way.

Jackson has always had a thing for Abby, but has just never been able to admit it.  Hes too afraid of losing his best friend when she rejects him.  But shes back in town and he just cant seem to keep his lips to himself.  Abbys had a rough go of it since she left Sweet and Jackson is trying to help her rediscover herself and forget her jerk-of-an-ex-husband.  The only problem is that he is still very attracted to her and scared to death to let her know it.

While the whole town of Sweet sees that Jackson and Abby belong together, Jackson and Abby just cant seem to get together.  Is their friendship going to stand in the way of a once-in-a-lifetime kind of love?  Maybe a little help from the rest of the Wilder family will help steer them in the right direction

Loved this book!  The Abby and Jacksons story was simply amazing.  Their back story and chemistry made this story such a wonderful and enjoyable read. The setting of Sweet, Texas was delightful, with all the supporting characters that makes this series so much fun to read.  But don't worry, even though its part of a series, this is a great stand-alone read also!  I loved the way that Jacksons ex-wife was portrayed in such a wonderful light and the relationship that developed between Jacksons daughter Izzy and Abby was heartwarming.  Jacksons mom, Jana, and brothers also helped to add a bit of humor to the story.  And of course, I simply couldn't wait for Jackson and Abby to finally find their happy ending!  I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series, Something Sweeter.  Well done Ms. Terry!

I think the premise for this series is an excellent concept.  I read many reviews of this book and everyone mentions how this book is a great sequel.  Unfortunately for me, I had not read the prequel so it did take me a bit to figure out the storyline.

The other reviewers have done excellent jobs of providing synopses of the story.

9508,"Jobs is a sort of semi autobiographical account of the rise and fall and rise again of Steve Jobs and Apple.  Not being a fan of Apple products per se, although I do like my I-pod, I watched this movie more out of curiosity than as a fan of the company or the man.  The movie provided an interesting insight to the life of Steve Jobs and the company itself, in some ways similar to the rise of Bill Gates.  I found it interesting that both men rose to prominence off the ideas of others in reality.  I am not normally an Ashton Kutcher fan but I found that his portrayal of Jobs was very well done, even emulating his walk and mannerisms very well.  The story itself is ok but I felt tended to stay away from the more complex issues of Jobs life and only highlighting some of them.  Maybe this would have made the story too long, I don't know, and may have been better suited as a mini-series in order to tell the full story as opposed to made for the big screen movie.  With Jobs now gone, it remains to be seen that the company will continue on with the passion that Jobs brought when he ran the company.  A chapter that is yet to be written.

With that being said, though I did find the movie entertaining to watch and informative as well.",2,"[-2.7239458121732802, -1.6824682175811196, -1.1219660340533517, -1.0051562513603343, -0.9663046827062783]",-0.9663046827062783

9382,"`Water' (2006) is the third and final film in Deepa Metha's' trilogy joining `Fire' (1997) and `Earth' (1999). While a slower moving film than the first two it is also the most poetic in atmosphere and much more traditionally Hindu in presentation. Like the two films preceding it `Water' deals with one of those ignored and generally unspoken problems underlying Indian culture. In this case it's the unethical, inhuman treatment of widows.

Synopsis: The film begins with the death of the husband of eight year old child bride Chuyia (Sarala), leaving the little girl a widow at an age when she should still be playing with dolls. She is taken to a rundown ashram housing an impoverished group of widows doomed to live out the rest of her life as outcasts. Chuyia forms an immediate bond with Kalyani (Lisa Ray) whose physical beauty has become the sole means of support for the community through the vehicle of prostitution.

Through a chance encounter Kalyani captures the attention of Narayan (John Abraham), a wealthy, idealistic follower of Gandhi. Soon a proposal of marriage follows and now for the first time Kalyani envisions the possibility of a new, happy life. However traditional beliefs and social pressures work against the young couple at every turn. As Kalyani battles with the superstitions and taboos that seek to deny her one last chance for love those same social evils begin to close in on young Chuyia threatening to enslave her into the same lifestyle Kalyani has endured. will Narayan have the strength of conviction to save them both or are they destined to remain amongst the forgotten and ignored? What would Gandhi do?

Critique: `Water' is a beautifully filmed and heartbreakingly elegant conclusion to Deepa Metha's trilogy. Everything was done to perfection in this film; cinematography, soundtrack, storytelling and wonderful acting with a number of truly memorable performances. Deepa Metha has once again shown how to meld filmmaking with important, contemporary issues without devaluing the cinematic art or the social message.

So this picks up straight from Book 1 and the cliff hanger did NOT have the ending I was expecting. This book focuses a lot on Mel's issues with commitment, but also brings into play angst in the lives of some of the side characters.

Whilst some reviewers felt this book lacked story I would say it was all about Mel learning to trust in love and really commit to the relationships she was building and repairing. She had allowed Belle and Veronica into her life but shied away from any other commitment to people. For me this was all about seeing Mel learn to trust in life and love again. I also liked that we saw Noah and Sawyer starting to repair their relationship and become closer.

This book also ends with both a cliff hanger and a devastating piece of news. These, and other issues, are dealt with in Book 3 which I can definitely tell you, you WON'T want to miss. I spent book 1 feeling that Mel wasn't with the right brother but in this book I saw the strength and depth of their love, though I couldn't help wishing the other twin would find his HEA.

I read all three books one after the other, rather than as they came out. I think this helped make book 2 have more impact and made the need for book 2 more obvious than if I had read them a few months apart, when the impact of book 1 was no longer in my head.

The chemistry these two have are off the charts and Im not ashamed to say I enjoyed every minute of it, even though Im not one to prefer those types of sexual adventures. Despite the provocative nature of the book, because theres no denying that it is that, theres also an intriguing and highly entertaining story that surrounds it. Cal and Macy are excellent characters in their own rights and it was so much fun getting to know them better.

Macy is quite the enigma and I am so damn curious as to what her secret could be. After meeting her family I have a small clue as to what it might be, but I could be wrong. Shes clearly a complex character and I was surprised at how easily she started letting her guard down with Cal. Admittedly, hes a hard guy to resist, so Ill give her that. Im hoping Bennett doesnt hold back with her story in Yield because we still barely know anything about her. The suspense is killing me!

We see a bit of Cals legal expertise in Grind and I enjoyed it immensely. Hes just a genuinely good guy, but he also has flair and confidence, which makes him very sexy and appealing. Macy certainly knows how to test his limits and its crazy the kinds of emotions and actions she can pull out of him. Cal shocked me with some of the things he did, thats for sure.

What I appreciated most about their story was that they both admitted that, given the nature and timing of their relationship, they weren't in love just yet. The strong feelings are there, of course, but it felt more realistic that these two just really cared for each other and connected on a deeper level, but kept it grounded because they both didn't really know that true love was to begin with.

In the end, all I have to say is  why, Sawyer, why?! Why must you torture me like this?! That ending was brutal and I seriously don't think Ive been more curious to know what happens next. I highly suggest you, if you're as impatient as I am, to wait until the last book, Yield, is out before you start Grind, because youll immediately want to read it to see how it all ends.

This review is a bit tricky to write creatively because I loved every aspect of the book.  I have not read the first in the series and I wish that I had so that I already had a handle on the characters.  There were a number of references to an earlier experience of the characters.  Having said that, the characters are what makes this an exceptionally well written story.  I really believe that I would recognize any one of them if I walked into a room and they were there.  Their personalities and descriptions were just simply that well written, developed, and interesting.  Of course, no discussion about the characters is complete without Dr. Genevieve Lenard.  I have never read a more complex and terrific character.  She is an amazingly intriguing person that I simply find insatiable.  I must read the other two, and upcoming, third story about her.  As a functionally competent autistic character, she brings a depth to the story that is unexpected.  There is a lot of dark humor surrounding her character.

The storyline is equal to the quality of the characters.  It is complex as a mystery thriller with some humor thrown in.  I was mesmerized by the progression of the plot.

I have two cats - one who is very particular about her treats and one who isn't. The older cat usually will only eat the Temptations brand treats that are catnip flavored. I was pleasantly surprised to see she loves these chicken and turkey flavored treats! She comes running when she hears the bag, eats the treats, and looks for more.

Our younger male cat isn't as particular about his food and predictably, he also loves the treats. The idea behind the round shape of these treats is they can be tossed so your cat can play with them. Also this cat is young and very playful, he takes his food very seriously and won't chase the treats or play with them. He sees them and immediately eats them without any playing around!

Based on how popular they are with my cats, I highly recommend the chicken and turkey Tumblers as treats for cats, but don't if all cats will play with them.

I would have to say that Anne of Cleves has been one of my favorite characters in these books (along with Mary Boleyn in The Other Boleyn Girl). Anne seems so innocent and really wanted to make a new life in England with the King. I loved that she wasn't necessarily as concerned about becoming Queen for the power, but more to get away from the life she lived with her family in Cleves. All she wants is to have some freedom, which for women now isn't too much to ask for, but it certainly was back then.

Katherine Howard... she is definitely portrayed as a stupid, young girl. She was somewhat entertaining, but so naive and ignorant. And Jane Rochford... well... she drove me crazy. At first I liked her and thought she was going to help out Queen Anne of Cleves. But then, once again, she just looks out for herself and seems to be willing to throw anyone under the bus as long as she is safe.

Overall, I really enjoyed this book! I was never bored and there is always something happening. I also love that it's told from different perspectives. I think, as readers, we would have lost a lot of the story if it were only told from one woman's view. Can't wait to read the next one in the series!

Calculated Risk by Rachael Duncan is a fantastic book which captivated me from the beginning. I could relate to many aspects and often felt a part of the story. I frequently wished that I could push a pause button on life and read the story in one sitting. The story line is just wonderful and full of drama, angst, love, humor, heartbreak and passion.

Lydia felt very real to me and I could relate to growing up with a critical parent and an a$$hole ex-fianc&eacute;. I understood why she would pretend she was married and guard herself. Marcus was so funny when pursuing her, but I completely fell for him when he stepped back and waited for Lydia. I think it takes a strong man to be able to do that!

It's just the right level of intensity to be an enjoyable read, it's sweet and there are so many moments of witty dialogue. Centered around a seventeen year old named Jessie as she moves to a new state, becomes part of a new family dynamic, and joins a new school. She's grieving the loss of her mother, the loss of the house she grew up in, and missing her best friend.  That's ALOT for anyone, but these new circumstances are enough to leave the poor girl in a haze of angst.

Jessie Holmes is one of those characters that is likable from the get go. We are immediately plunged into Jessie's new reality and meet her anonymous email pal Somebody Nobody. I LOVE stories when they unfold through personal communications. I just seem to get the characters quicker and this story is filled with a great group of people Jessie is forced to interact with, most coming from her new school.

As to characters, Buxbaum provides us with the dismissive step-brother (Theo), the schools' ""mean girls"" (Crystal and Gem), the brooding and nerdy hot boy(Ethan), new friends Dri and Agnes, and of course Scarlett - the best friend left behind in Chicago. But the real star of the story Somebody Nobody ( who may or may not be one of the aforementioned characters).  Jessie's email and instant message conversations with ""SN"" are so telling and where the sweet and witty aspects really shine. I caught myself smiling at their banter. And yes, I googled Fermi Paradox.  With SN,  Jessie starts to feel not so alone. The big mystery is ""who is SN"" and we're left wondering IF and WHEN SN will come-forward. Its fun as Jessie tries to figure it out and makes some unexpected guesses.

Blake and Liz had a somewhat awkward connection that bothered me a little initially because they had both married siblings. He married her ex husbands sister and vice versa. It was a little icky when put in terms of her daughter and his son being cousin/step-siblings. I thought I would be too grossed out to enjoy it but found myself OK with it because both characters were adorable together and deserved happiness after what they went through.

Blame The Mistletoe was sweet and romantic.

991,"The setting is 1974 Atlanta, the bad old days. ""Cop Town"", from author Karin Slaughter is a spine tingling mystery thriller that's like a punch in gut with it's non stop suspense. Good versus evil, man versus woman, and the future versus the past. In 1974 the Atlanta Police Department is attempting to incorporate women into it's ranks. The good ole boy network which has driven this department for decades will have none of it. However, in the space of six months several police officers have been gunned down in cold blood. Maggie Lawson a somewhat new officer is charged with breaking in brand new rookie Kate Murphy. Maggie's brother Jimmy, and her uncle Terry both longtime cops are determined to get Maggie off the force. Shockingly one night shift Jimmy is wounded by ""The Shooter"", with partner Don being killed. The men of the Atlanta PD become enraged. The kid gloves are coming off, they will allow no rule or policy from stopping them from tracking down ""The Shooter"", and preforming immediate justice done. Maggie and the very raw rookie Kate are teamed up and working the case as if they are detectives. With non stop action, and some incredible twists and turns this story line is pure high octane. Author Karin Slaughter has done it again building a masterpiece by using some colorful and very hard nosed characters. Dialog in this book sizzles. The plot's foundation is set in stone and capable of sustaining a high quality mystery thriller. I really enjoyed every page as they flew by so quickly. I couldn't wait to get to the end to find out what would happened. Then again, I've never read a Karin Slaughter book that hasn't been spectacular. I'd highly rate, and recommend this thriller to anyone who is even just a casual mystery reader. Rest assured the hard core thriller readers will eat this one up quickly. Absolutely five stars out of possible five stars, ""Cop Town"", is a home run just as Henry Aaron hit home run number 715 in 1974. This is a must read.

The year is 1917 and the Great War is raging in Europe.  Grace is trying to do her part, first by shaming young men into fighting for England as her brother Colin is doing.  When that doesnt end well she joins the Womens Forage Corps.  They do farm work in place of the men who have gone to battle.  Unfortunately, Grace has never really worked before  on arrival at the farm one of the other workers asks to see her hands  Just as I thought.  Those hands have never seen a days work.  Well, Im no aristocrat. Grace turned back to Clare Danner, a mere co-worker after all.  And I have worked at my fathers business.  She left off the fact shed only done paper work, occasionally greeted Das more affluent customers

Alas, things do not go well for Grace.  Would her time in the WFC come to an early end?  She envisioned after the others made her a laughingstock shed be forced to resign, and return to London. Da would follow through on his threat and send for Aunt Florence until Clarence Fowler could return from America to wed her.

Yet, not all is as it appears to be.  Who is the Tin Man at the manor house?  Why would Jack Benningham, a playboy, a gambler, and (one who) stays out all night, be hiding away there?  It seems each character has a secret to be uncovered as Grace continues to promote womens suffrage and patriotism  For King, for Country, For Freedom.

2960,"I've read the Elm Creek books and, with few exceptions, I've liked them all. The Lost Quilter picks up the story of Joanna, the runaway slave from The Runaway Quilt. As with the other Elm Creek books, this one begins with Sylvia discovering a new fact about her family or their quilting. While the beginning and end of the book are about Sylvia trying to find out information about Joanna, the book itself is, Joanna's story.

After her son was born at the Bergstrom farm, Joanna was recaptured and returned to her master in Virginia. She took with her a desire to find her son, her newly found ability to read and her mastery with the needle. Her master sells her to his brother in South Carolina and Joanna begins a new life, finding friends and love. Joanna dreams of returning to Elm Creek and she pieces a quilt, reminiscent of the underground railroad quilts. In it she sews the landmarks she remembers, in hopes that someday it will guide her back to Elm Creek.

Joanna's strength sees her through difficulties with selfish mistresses and the Civil War, and the legacy she leaves behind will finally answer some of Sylvia's questions.

I was prepared to not like this book. I think that, at some point, a story needs to end. While I do think Jennifer Chiaverini runs the risk of weakening a strong story if she insists on giving every possible character their own book, I enjoyed this one. Slave narratives have always fascinated me, and reading the story from Joanna's viewpoint was compelling.

Avery Tate is a gifted, but blacklisted, photographic artist who quit her job as a crime scene photographer and her boss, Parker Mitchell, so she could sort out her growing feelings for him.  Now she finds herself supporting a friend in the photography world that turned its back on her, that friend is missing and theres a chilling photo of her posed as if she were dead.  So Avery seeks out Parkers help to find her missing friend.

Still Life is book two in the Chesapeake Valor series by Dani Pettrey, but can easily be read as a stand-alone novel.  Pettrey is a gifted suspense and romance author who has crafted an edge-of-your-seat, stay-up-way-past-bedtime story.

Remember how they were so perfect together and how they played out little scenes about remembering things they had done togetherthings they had never done together but that fed the little lie they were telling her family? It was freaking awesome!

I absolutely loved Theo and April. Their chemistry was instantaneous and despite the deal they had going neither of them could keep things platonic for long. This was a low angst read with plenty of mature humor that had me smiling the whole time.

April hired Theo to act as her boyfriend during a family reunion that is chock full of competitions. The games aren't the problem, the problem is her family is determined to set her up with one of the locals so shell stay in Wistful where they all live.

This was a very upbeat read with some incredible secondary characters and plenty of laugh out loud moments. The steam is sizzling although this couple don't get down and dirty until 80% into the story. That doesnt mean there isn't teasing and tensionlots and lots of tension.

7140,"""The Ones That Got Away,"" is an intense romance that courageously brings to life the aftermath of two characters Finn and Liv who are both one of the few remaining survivors of a grizzly shooting massacre at their local high school. I will point out that I felt a little uneasy going into my reading of this novel due to all of the recent media coverage regarding similar tragedies. Still, I admired the author's bravery in enabling a successful attempt at bringing this very real reality into a work of fiction for the characters themselves. Shootings are not a topic that I see in a romance novel that often and so I thought that I would keep an open mind and read this book.

  Overall I found this romance to be successful in the sense that the story itself was built on a solid foundation of vibrate, heartwrenching images that eventually blossomed into hope and into love between both Fin and Liv. I was a little surprised by the fact that Liv turned out to be the strongest of the two characters. Liv was emotionally scarred from the events but I felt like she was determined to survive. On the hand, Finn really needed a boast, a lift in order to push through the aftermath and Liv really enabled him to do so. Both of these characters were reluctant to forget their past, but together they were able to find a true meaning within the lives of one another.

  As for the romance, this story is a bit of a second chance with Finn and Liv reconnecting with one another, but I also felt like the romance was a bit of a letdown. The attraction between the duo was intense from the start but those same sparks were only ignited by lust. In other words, there is a great deal of sex in this story but not much open romance.

I was familiar with Craig Ferguson mostly through his late night TV show (and then realized I knew him from Drew Carey). I'd heard his self-deprecating references to his drinking and drug use, and knew he was in recovery, and was aware of his strong patriotic streak after choosing American citizenship. I regularly Tivo his shows, and then watch the monologues over the weekend.

The laughs come early in this book (including in the captions of the obligatory photos). His descriptions of being introduced to Dick Cheney and George Bush at the White House correspondents' dinner are wickedly funny. But this book is more than gags; interspersed with the laughs are places of pathos and sadness that put a lump in my throat as he filled in the pre-Drew Carey blanks with careers as a rock and roll drummer, a electrical parts assembler, an illegal-alien sheetrock hanger, stand-up comedian and actor. He pulls no punches in describing the worst of his drinking and drug use, and avoids sanctimony in discussing his eventual recovery; he is respectful to a fault of the traditions of the original 12-step recovery program...which he doesn't name --so I won't guess- but assures us it can be found near the front of most phone books...

7127,"I read this book through Kindle Unlimited.  Its my first book by this author and the writing is excellent.  Its told through Amanda's pov but we get Noah's in the epilogue.  I would have given it 5 stars but it went a little long and overboard with Amanda's denying her and Noah's happiness and Noah's continual dating of Brooke knowing he didn't love her.  This book is 100% Angst!!!!

Amanda and Noah are born on the same day, one minute apart.  They grow up as neighbors and their families spend time together throughout their whole lives.  They totally love each other.  When they are freshmen in high school Noah wants her to be his girlfriend but Amanda is to afraid of loosing his friendship should things go bad.  I was ok with this because they were soooo young at this time.  Once they are seniors she still keeps him in the friend zone, watching him date girl after girl because she won't be with him.  Now it is starting to get old.

Right before graduation her life takes a turn when she gets involved with Brad and what happens devastates her.  She basically hooks up with him because Noah is with Brooke.  With her low self-esteem being in her sisters shadow she believes she isn't good enough for Noah.  She believes Brooke when she tells her she is being selfish by being such a big part of Noah's life and not allowing him to move on and be happy with her.  She breaks the friendship and destroys Noah before she heads off to college.  Months later she runs into Noah again at a party and thinks he has proposed to Brooke, as she runs away from him she sprains her ankle.  The sprain turns into a life threatening illness.

During treatment and her building friendship with Dylan she finally comes to appreciate life and how short it can be.  She finally tells Noah she loves him on his doorstep with Brooke wrapped up in a sheet after having sex with Noah.  She runs home, Noah turns up later telling her they broke up and we finally get their first time together.  It was tarnished by the earlier sex with Brooke IMO.  The book gets really sad at this point as we are lead to believe the worst.  I didn't get to enjoy it for having to skip ahead to make sure we were getting our HEA and we do!!  I was over all the angst at this point.  Its a really emotional read, grab your tissues!!!",3,"[-1.8274567763014828, -0.9742987788652699, -1.0499398908595872, -1.0601544042790605, -1.2511757870884515]",-0.9742987788652699

The cutesy cover of her first book in this series, Loose Screw, got me interested, but it was the first class mystery that kept me hooked until I clicked the last page on my Kindle.

Lucy Matthews is a crime reporter turned antiques dealer, who one day stumbles across a body. When her ex-boss asks her to follow up the murder for a story she reluctantly agrees and ends up knee-deep in a murder investigation.

This was a really fun mystery. I could completely relate to Lucy in her love for her pets and the way they boss her around. I live in a family of two cats and one hamster and even the hamster knows I'm a pushover.

The mystery felt well plotted out and I really enjoyed the combination of Lucy and Detective Blake. I sure hope there is more romance between the two of them in later books in the series.

1967,"Once upon a time there was (and, for all I know still is) a rock group called ""The Rock Bottom Remainders"".
They were either a mediocre band who couldn't hold a candle to groups like Aerosmith or the Stones, etc., or a surprisingly good band considering their make-up which consisted, not of professional musicians, but of the likes of Stephen King, Amy Tan, Ridley Pearson, etc.

In short they were some of our best writers relaxing and having fun.

When they do this with their writing skills, you get books like ""Naked Came the Stranger"", ""The President's Murder Mystery"", and many others.

Books with a ""gimmick"" written to have fun and, not incidentally, raise a little money for some worthy cause.

Sometimes it's a novel wherein each of several authors takes a chapter; sometimes, as Donald Westlake and Brian Garfield did a number of years ago, it's a pair of authors alternating chapters (and trying to put each other in untenable situations).

And, sometimes, it's a collection like this one where two authors ""collaborate"" on a short story containing one or more of each one's continuing characters

I LOVE these kinds of books.

As one would suspect, none of the authors are at their peak, but, because they ARE pros, and good ones, none disappoint, either.

I suspect every reader will have his/her own favourite story, based on their own taste in writers. Mine is the first because it has ""Patrick Kenzie"", but I'm also fiercely partial to R.L. Stines collaboration with the team of Preston & Child.

NONE of the tales are less than competent, and a few approach (semi) greatness (in a fun sort of way)

Indeed, the only quibble I have is that, contrary to the claims on the cover, the concept is hardly unique (at one time I had a collection approaching 3 figures).

591,"BLACK COUNTRY is part of Alex Grecian's SCOTLAND YARD MURDER SQUAD series, preceded by THE YARD.

In this novel, set in the late 1880's, Inspector Walter Day and Sergeant Nevil Hammersmith travel to the Black Country, a coal mining district of England to assist the local constable with an investigation.  Members of a prominent family have gone missing - possibly murdered - and a child has discovered a human eye in a bird's nest.  Dr. Bernard Kingsley, ahead of his time in forensic medicine, has come as well.  Many other things happen in this village; the homes and buildings sink, sometimes inches at a time, because of the underground mine shafts, and many in the village are falling ill with a severe fever.

The plot of this novel is very suspenseful, just as it should be in this genre.  Unlike THE YARD, readers aren't certain too soon how things will turn out.  This plot isn't presented in a linear manner; readers take some flashbacks with one Scottish character to his time in North America during the U.S. Civil War, including his capture and imprisonment in Andersonville.  (Note to sensitive readers:  As with many thrillers, this novel includes some graphic descriptions, in particular, some strong descriptions of the poor conditions in Andersonville.)  A particular lesser plot thread that keeps the tension in this novel up is the fact that Inspector Day has a limited time to resolve this case; he and his wife are expecting their first child very soon.

As for other elements of this novel, the characters and setting are well-done.  Grecian handles both of these well; readers have enough information to visualize the characters and setting, but just enough is left to readers' imagination.

From the inside jacket flap:  It should have been an open and shut murder case, but Mia Quinn finds out nothing about it is simple.

After a young Chinese prostitute is stabbed to death by her rich American client, the tabloids dub Dandan Yee Lethal Beautydespite the fact that she was the one who ended up dead. Yet even with double standards and naked prejudice working against her, Seattle prosecutor Mia Quinn is determined to get justice for Dandan Yee.

But when a key witness goes missing and an unsavory juror shuts down deliberations without explanation, Mia fears the trialand the laware being tampered with.

A constellation of fresh killings has Mia and homicide detective Charlie Carlson searching for a common source and puts Mias family in the crosshairs of a Chinese crime cabal. Meanwhile, Dandan Yees mother has opted to take matters into her own hands . . . and the stakes get more lethal overnight.

In the midst of all this, Mia has to contend with a fifteen-year-old son who is growing up too fast for his own good, and the idea that Charlie might want to be more than just friends. Can Mia and Charlie stop the murders and still keep her family safe? Or is the very act of seeking justice enough to cost her everythingand everyoneshe loves?

The team of Wiehl and Henry is unbeatable. The quality of story that they produce is exceptional. This time around Mia is dealing with illegal immigration or human trafficking. The people are being brought here with the lure of a better life only to find themselves in prostitution. Mia now has to deal with the murders of these illegal immigrants and trouble at home. Lethal Beauty is an excellent murder mystery filled with marvelous characters, great plot twists, suspense and thrills.  This is an exciting book, extremely well paced and suspenseful.

7018,"There is no doubt that Orwell became a great writer.  And this book (along with ""Burmese Days"") may have provided the first indications of his brilliance.  However, unlike some of his other works, this one has not passed the test of time.  While his writing is good, the book has become somewhat dated; it is locked into the world as it was nearly 100 years ago, and it consequently is less relevant and shocking than one might expect, particuarly given what we've come to expect from Orwell.  His descriptions of what poverty was like in Paris and London do not paint a happy picture, but they pale in comparison to some more modern works -- Barbara Ehrenreich's ""Nickled and Dimed"", to mention just one.

What is mosts sad and distressing about the book is that despite the passage of so many years, and despite our belief that we've become a kinder, gentler society, not much has changed when it comes to poverty and how we treat the poor.  And, of course, there was nothing that Orwell could do about that -- though he certainly seems to have been able to predict the future in his most famous works.",2,"[-1.869798535889716, -1.3732585343736137, -0.9797863118888201, -1.0159472610185631, -1.555640783500504]",-0.9797863118888201

805,"If you like your thrillers to be original, fast-paced, shocking yet humorous, filled with action and (yes) educational, then Josh Bazell's debut thriller, Beat The Reaper, is one you should definitely consider reading. The plot and its intriguing main character will have you on the edge of your seat from the moment you start Beat The Reaper until you reach its final page. Dr. Peter Brown is currently an intern at a Manhattan hospital and has a real talent for medicine. However, he has a past that he desperately wants to keep hidden. That's because before going into medicine he was Pietro ""Bearclaw"" Brnwa, a violent hit man for the Mafia. I won't go into more detail since I don't want to risk giving away any of the multiple twists and turns in Beat The Reaper. I'll just say that Bazell's writing style and engaging plot will have you glued to your seat following Brown/Brnwa in his efforts to avoid the mob, the government and his own demise (i.e. beat the Reaper). The only factor that causes me to give this book a 4 1/2 vs. 5 star rating is that the ending -- while fun and entertaining -- was too far-fetched.

The book, I think, is about this central question of how girls grow into women when the female figures who are supposed to usher you into womanhood aren't there. How girls come of age with that absence. And its about how communities are shaped by loss, this thing I keep writing abouthow in moments of grief, community can be both a source of comfort and a source of oppression. My main character feels this responsibility to her community yet wants to escape it at the same time. And I was interested in this complexity, as well as the experience of being a young black woman in a community that expects a lot of her, in a world that expects very little.

I found the above insight in this online interview with the author and I think it summarizes The Mothers theme beautifully. Overall, I liked The Mothers and especially enjoyed reading the relationship dynamics written into this story in terms of family, friendship, church body, and a conservative small town. I appreciated Brit Bennett bringing attention to gender double standards, role expectations, and negative self-fulfilling prophecies. This was an interesting read that was both entertaining and thought provoking. If you enjoy reading a variety of themes within the literary fiction and women's fiction genres, check it out!

557,"Having heard so much about this book I felt obligated to read it and see for myself why it has generated so much buzz. As someone who didn't know a tremendous amount about the story going in, I found the book to be much more violent and horrifying than I expected.

The book consists of two storylines involving disgraced financial reporter Mikael Blomkvist, and socially-inept hacker Lisbeth Salander. Together the two are trying to uncover the mystery surrounding the death of corporate heiress Harriet Vanger, and expose the financial misdeeds of a prominent tycoon. I was much more taken with the Vanger mystery than with the story about corporate corruption. That was rather dry.

One of Larsson's larger objectives in this book is clearly to highlight the disturbing pervasiveness of violence against women. All of the significant violence in the book is gendered, and is perpetrated against female victims. One of its victims is co-protagonist Lisbeth Salander. She is certainly an interesting character, one who is uncomfortable with what many of us might consider basic sociability. She is also a woman who has endured much abuse, and that makes her essential to Larsson's larger point. One of Salander's most significant problems is that legally she is considered a ward of the state. She had been in this position as a child without competent parents, but her status as a legal dependent was allowed to continue into her adulthood. The fact that an adult who earns her own money, holds a job, and is capable of managing the basic elements of day-to-day life can be legally alienated from her money and her basic legal rights is, quite simply, frightening. Clearly Larsson is making an argument against the institution of guardianship. I was unclear if the portion of the text which explain guardianship were part of Larsson's original text, or if they were added by the translator for the non-Swedish audience.

This is not the most amazing book I've ever read, but it's a book I'll certainly think about for some time. I suspect I'll read the next two books in the trilogy, as long as I can stomach the violence. Larsson does not glorify the horrific violence about which he writes, but it is, undeniably, difficult to read.",3,"[-1.5678720422701713, -0.9803782729416997, -1.0230722730296888, -1.0390024732337844, -1.0439795663485325]",-0.9803782729416997

What is surprising is Ewan McGregor who can be so hit and miss in romantic leading roles (check out The Island and you'll see what I mean).

4449,"FIVE STARS
In this five star read by Sheena Hutchinson, Discovering April, we explore many of our emotions and fall in love with the boy next door as well.
April is a college student who has yet to decide what she wants to do when she grows up.  Attending classes with an undecided major she really has no clue as to what she wants to do with her life.  All she knows for now is that life consists of class, her job at the coffee shop and her boyfrined Hunter.  However things with Hunter never seem to change.  They are always fighting and arguing.  Now Hunters eyes are wandering and he keeps looking at other girls while they are together.
Jared is the boy next door.  His family moved into the house next door when April and Jared were 10 years old.  They were inseperable as children and hung out all the time.  Their adventures as children were fulfilling and fun.  Things started changing their first year of high school and April discovered boys.  Boy friends didn't like their girlfriends have boys that were just friends.  So April and Jared drifted apart.  Jared parents died in an accident and he dropped out of school.  April hadn't spoken to him since.  Yet he was always right next door.
The end of summer saw the end of Hunter and April.  After a 2 week depression fest, April has just had a run in with a bout of suicide thoughts and is sitting on her porch when Jared approaches her as asks her if she would like to go for a ride with him.  She climbs on his motorcycle with him and they spend the day together.  This is the first of many times they hang out and become friends again.
This is a very sweet story.  There is anger and fear, love and loss, heart break and tears, laughter and silliness.  Most importantly there is trust and honesty, love and fighting for who you want.  April finally discovers what it is she wants to do in life and the promise of ""don't leave me""

3922,"I quickly became hooked on this series of plausible post-apocalyptic novels after reading the first in the series, Frontier Justice. Dr. Bradley has written an insightful series that provides valuable information for life in general and being prepared for a crisis. Having served 30 years as a field artilleryman with 13 years overseas including a combat tour in Vietnam, I could relate to the observations and experiences of Deputy Mason Raines who is a true American hero. In fact, I thoroughly enjoy how well Dr. Bradly has developed each of the main and side characters.  The author is extremely knowledgeable about weapons and equipment.
I remain more than a little troubled, however, by the self-serving actions of several senior officers and elected officials.  The author presents a much higher degree of coherent governmental organization than could possibly have survived the plague.  I continue to find it hard to believe that given the widespread nature of the epidemic organized units of the military would be capable of search operations for Samantha.  I was shaking my head when the President and her senior advisors were even discussing such matters as the unguarded border with Mexico and striking drug cartels given the widespread destruction within the United States.  Although I realize that this is a work of fiction, finding a document from 1969 concerning the transfer of several Weteye chemical bombs and also having a hardcopy personnel file from then strained my credulity.
The author showed his familiarity with the Amish by using their term for the non-Amish.
Three of my favorite quotes:
Whether such judgment is found with the pounding of a gavel, at the wrong end of a gun, or from the firm hand of our Creator, everyone must eventually answer for their transgressions.
Retribution is not always swift, nor does it resurrect those who have been lost.  It does, however, allow hands to stop wringing and tears to be wiped from blood shot eyes.  Fear of judgment is rarely enough to keep evil at bay, but it remains a righteous beacon to those who have suffered.
Do you have to practice every day?  No, Mason assured him.  Only on the days you want to live.

2927,"Brad Thor has a knack of bringing his many characters to life and realistically weaving them in from page to page toward a surprise ending. Hidden Order is no exception. The story has a two-pronged plot with two teams working toward ferreting out the bad guy, or guys, who abducted members of the Federal Reserve group. One team, with our hero, Scot Harvath, working for the Carlton Group, partners with Boston detective, Laura Cordero; while the other team is made up of experienced CIA operatives, Lydia Ryan and Bob McGee. Each team has its own agenda and direction. The reader is kept guessing as to whether or not these teams might come together at some point to solve the case.
The story initially unfolds in Washington, D.C., but soon lands in Boston. As we track the story we learn about America's 18th century history and famous landmarks in the Boston area. Brad Thor cleverly weaves civics lessons into the scenario without impeding the essence of the story.
The author goes into great detail explaining the origin and history of our 100-year-old Federal Reserve System, how it was created in secrecy, and how even today it operates in secrecy with little measure of transparency.
One cannot but wonder if given similar circumstances a comparable scenario could play out within our own government today.

5874,"It seem like forever since we have had a purely m/m romance from Nicole Edwards, but Reckless has made the wait worth it!'

Reckless is the first in the Pier 70 series, based around the lives of Cam, Dare, Roan and Teague. There is quite a bit of set up for the series, but this is Cam's story.

Cam Strickland has been in a dry spell for a while, and it has been a long time since he has had a reaction to another man.

Gannon Burgess is all work no play, and doesn't even want to be at the marina, but his best friend Milly has other ideas for him and his workers.

Cam and Gannon could not come from two more different worlds, but their attraction to each other knows no bounds. You can feel the pull between them right from the get go. There is some great banter between the two, along with shameless ogling!

I loved how their friends saw so much between them, pushed the issue with them to make them take that step into ""relationshipville"".

I got a little frustrated with Cam and his pull/push with Gannon. As we learn more of his past, yes I could understand his actions why more, but I still wanted to shake some sense into him. I felt Ms Edwards dealt with his demons, his personal issues very well.

I loved the interactions between Gannon and Milly, and Cam's interactions with Dare, Teague and Roan. These went from downright hilarious to heartbreakingly tender.

There was some scenes with Cam and Roan that brought a tear to my eye.

I hope Roan's story is next, as I feel it is going to be an emotional ride.

But then again, I think Dare, Roan and Teague are all going to have intriguing stories.

Reckless is great start to the Pier 70 series, and I am looking forward to more in the future.

Americans in Moscow learn of a Soviet spy school that supposedly trains future Soviet agents to talk, act, look and think like Americans. Part of the teaching staff is made up of American MIA fliers shot down over North Vietnam in the 1960s and whisked off to Moscow to form the instructor cadre for the charm school. The plot delves into the human psyche of the common Russian citizen, the treacherous KGB agents, and even the low-life Soviet farmer and the poor.
Nelson DeMille has done his research well. Someone once said what makes for good writing is a believable plot, interesting characters, realistic dialogue, suspense, mystery, romance, the battle between good and evil, and sometimes a happy ending. DeMille has captured every single one of the above to produce one of the finest novels I have read in years. It holds even more meaning for me now (2014) in that the new president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, is attempting to return Russia back to those evil, surreptitiousness and deceitful ways of the old Soviet Society.
The novel grabs the reader in the first chapter and doesnt let go until the very last page. I give this novel my very highest rating. It will keep you up late at night.

He's been saving, hoping, and finally he thinks he's found it.

Not that Rancho Diablo doesn't have some problems. For one thing, the water is polluted with sulfur, which gives it its name. Worse, though, are the neighbors. The first time he comes into town, a group of young thugs follows him, planning on stealing the money he's been saving to buy the ranch. Then there's the question of money--while the owner is anxious to sell, the least he'll take is twice what Sam has available. Still, Sam takes out a loan, buys the property, then invites a couple of his friends to help out...both with engineering and with the gunwork needed to keep the ranch his, and his life intact.

Author Colby Jackson keeps that pace fast, with Sam's problems escalating and new problems and opportunities with each turn of the page. Secondary characters, especially the young man who joined the initial ambush but who comes around to Sam and the talkative ranch hand, Gabby, add color and make the dry Sam more human.

1428,"Sophie Stanton, thirty-six year old public relations specialist in San Jose, has just lost her husband to cancer. She wants to portray herself as a stoic, dignified, quietly suffering widow, but can't quite pull that off. She eats ice cream and Oreos obsessively, gains weight, gives away her nearly-new living room furniture to Goodwill instead of parting with her husbands belongings, breaks all her dishes and shows up to work in her bathrobe and slippers because she can't find anything that fits.

She decides to re-invent herself, because her old self seems to be lost. She moves to Ashland to be near an old college friend and starts to rebuild her life. But she's not over the grieving process yet, and has setbacks and bad days. She takes a job as a waitress because that's all there is in Ashland, starts dating an actor, and befriends a troubled 13-year old girl through the Big Sister program.

Sophie's despair and growth through the grieving process are heartwarming and a little frightening, because I couldn't help wondering how I would fare in a similar situation. The chapter names in the book describe her journey to renewed mental health: Denial, Oreos, Anger, Depression, Escrow, Ashes, Lust, Bargaining, Waitressing, Mentoring, Dating, Baking, Acceptance, Goodwill, Thanksgiving. She seems to take in others who are flawed or needy in some way, and in helping them to mend themselves, gets her life back on an even keel.

Further reveals are made about James Denis, sort of the all around mafia bad guy, who wants to keep Gabriel Lacey dangling on his string.  But, of course, our dear Captain Lacey doesn't dangle on anyone's string, at least not for very long.

Our mystery in this book revolves around Mr. Denis' all around second in command, Mr. Chapman, going missing in Norfolk, Lacey's place of birth.  Lacey had decided to go to his home place while participating in a house party in the region along with his lady love, Donata Breckenridge.  During this visit, Lacey and Donata take a tour of Lacey's home which has fallen into ruin and begin to make plans to restore the house where they will spend their summers after they are wed.

But, Mr. Denis has an errand for Lacey to take care of while he's in the area which means the Denis crew descend upon the area with a vengeance as they look for very valuable original pieces of artwork.  Concurrently with the mystery of the missing Mr. Chapman, Lacey runs into a secondary mystery when he finds a young woman's dress in his ruined estate.  Lacey must find out who the dress belonged to because that's what he does and as he investigates this matter, more issues arise.

When Donata finds a notebook under the carpet in the drawing room belonging to Lacey's deceased mother, Lacey finds some secrets about his mother's life that reveals much about her of which he was unaware.  As is usual, we have the great pleasure of Grenville's company, we see a little bit of Marianne and we are given further insight into James Denis' youth.

Clean romance, some violence.
  This was a fast paced and interesting read! I have read the initial book in the series, but this is easily a stand alone read.  The chapters varied between the present day and the past between the historical figures and the present day people were scrambling over artifacts discovered at a burial site/tomb.
  The action was face paced, intense, and a nice hint of romantic feelings in both eras.  The suspense was well done, and very readable.  A perfect read for anyone who enjoys some action, some history, and a bit of romance as well.  For me personally, I loved learning more about the Egyptian historical figures.  H. B. Moore really brought them to life.  I know it was fictionalized, but they seemed so real.

""How could he expect more with her if he couldn't be a friend first?""

Wyatt Hanley is a shy person. He's an electrician by trade, a professional on the job. However, he's never found the right ""connection"", especially with women. He hides his scars and his fears behind the hooded sweatshirts that keep him insulated from other people.

Kayla Malone, young, widowed mother of a young son,Brady, lives on the floor above his. He's attracted to her, but she's badly hurt from her husband's psychological abuse and angry about how he neglected both her and their son.

This story is about how they both overcome their fearful pasts and begin to mature in their lives. Motivated by attraction, each must move beyond those walls and trust their feelings.

I think, without a doubt, that this is one of the best contemporary romances I have read in years. Not driven by physicality, the intimacy is just part of the story, not built around it. The emotions ring true, the storyline is believable. You want to care for these two lost people as they find their way towards each other.

It is simple to use, it has a large opening in which to pour the water into the base and the carafe has the largest opening of the three (Melitta, Mr. Coffee, Krups). It pours well, and the carafe comes out of the fully enclosed base unit without a catch, unlike my Melitta which catches at the bottom each time. It is a nice looking unit as well.
The krups comes with a gold basket for brewing without a paper filter. With the Mr. Coffee the nylon filter is optional.
There are beeps with this unit when brewing is done and the clock window is lighted.
Of the three coffee makers that I have, I used the same coffee, R O water, the same amount of water and coffee, used a paper filter and the same grind, all three made good coffee. I really couldn't tell the difference in the three. The exception was when I put the Mr. Coffee on the strong setting, which I feel is a gimmick, the coffee was not stronger, just very bitter. If you desire stronger coffee use more beans. I felt the Krups was the easiest to use and was the simplest.
 I don't make coffee using a timer since I like to grind the coffee fresh, so I didn't test the timer. After reading the timer instructions over, it appeared straight forward to use. The Krups uses the no. 4 filter which I have always preferred.

415,"Winslow has been compared to Raymond Chandler and Elmore Leonard for his hip novels of Southern California and the sly wit of his writing. But anyone who has read The Power of the Dog will understand this author's grasp of politics and culture, appropriately cynical about the nature of bureaucracy, the war on drugs and the folly and waste of it all, as played out in his two protagonists in Savages: Ben and Chonny. Ever the idealist, Ben chooses to walk away when the Baja Cartel makes a move on their hugely lucrative marijuana business. But like the flip side of a coin, Chon is more pragmatic, understanding that acquiescence will be mistaken for weakness. The pair is at an impasse until the involvement of their friend, Ophelia, makes it impossible to embrace the way of the temperate.

In his inimitable staccato style, Winslow blows through the consciousness of the three friends and the simian brain of the Baja Cartel, who can only be met with similar force. The result, while often hilarious, is ultimately tragic, when the way to power is only through savage methods. Winslow makes pithy and poignant comments on our So Cal version of civilization, with an unwavering eye and an acerbic sense of justice. It's always a pleasure to read a local author's perceptions of the all-too-familiar places in my city and neighboring jurisdictions, as familiar to me as Ben and Chon's lives are unfamiliar (but accessible thanks to Winslow). That is Winslow's gift: like it or not, you gain entry into his world, beautiful, sleek, troubled and decidedly more often than not, savage.

155,"It is a cliche that real truth lies in the small things that we feel and observe.  In this very well-written novel, the truth lies in the small things and the big things, both seriously and inexplicably intertwined.  For who is to tell from one minute to the next what is 'small' and what is 'large', at least in how it will impact the future.

This is a book about marriage, friendship and adultery.  Ben and Claire meet at Cambridge and add another ex-patriot American, Charlie to their clique. Charlie is in love with being part of this group and he has a serious undercurrent of deep feelings and lust for Claire.  Sad to say, however, but Claire is engaged to Ben and Charlie never tests the waters of what might or could have been with him and Claire.  Claire introduces Charlie to her best friend, Alison, with the intent of fixing them up, and they end up getting married.

The book revolves around these two couples - Claire and Ben, and Allison and Charlie.  As the book opens, Claire has just published a novel and she is having her opening celebration for the publication that night.  Charlie and Claire are already well-entrenched in their affair.  Alison attends the opening alone. (The truth is that Charlie feels too uncomfortable to accompany Alison but he makes up another excuse to avoid attending the party).  On the way home from the party, where Alison had a bit too much to drink, she is involved in a serious motor vehicle accident that is not her fault.  However, her high alcohol level creates a lot of self-blame and shame for her.  It also gives Charlie a good excuse to distance himself from her and blame her for the accident.

This book is about the every day intimacies and distances in relationships; how things begin to braid and how they unravel.  As I said earlier, the book is very well-written.  I would have given it a '5' except I felt that Alison's character is not fleshed out enough, and she plays a pivotal point in this book. I also felt that Charlie could have been a more well-developed character.

However, this is more a reminiscence of life in the Midwest in the 1950's.  There were a few funny moments in this book but not nearly as many as a ""A Walk in the Woods"".

If you are a baby boomer and enjoy reading about growing up in that era, then this book will appeal.  There are things here that all of us can enjoy if you are like me, a child of the 1950's.

The author uses the book as a tool for rants against the United States in some of the last chapters.  He particularly has great unhappiness with Republicans, the CIA, and Nixon among others.

However, if you like to read about the past and remember some of the good times of the era  then this is a fun book; it is just not as laugh out loud funny as ""A Walk in the Woods"".

I never thought I'd like reading a western...much less a zombie western (I mean, c'mon- the zombie craze has been hot for a while, it's a bit overdone at this point) but this book is a rare gem! The characters are lovable and gritty- the book flows very well, with a good but not too quick pace and many twists and turns along the way- most of them I never saw coming! Where the author could have mis-stepped and drawn out certain parts or made too big a deal about the zombies, thankfully, she didn't! There was just enough gore and lore (haha!) to make the zombies interesting and a ""real"" part of the character's lives without it being ""all about zombies"" or going too much into ""how the zombies came to be"" (which I can't remember even being apart of the story, which I thought was quite refreshing- a zombie book minus the whatever horrible circumstance that caused them to become such monsters but it didn't detract at all from the story!).

Though there are glimpses of Bryson's characteristic wit and engaging ability to tell history, science, and other intellectually-stimulating yarns, the book is mostly just a log of his complaining about the architecture of British cities while eating at pubs. He does well to capture the unique culture of the British, but this is definitely one of his weaker works. I much more prefer his Short History of Nearly Everything, Made in America, The Mother Tongue, and Shakespeare: All the World's a Stage, to his travel writings. Still, Bryson is always a good read, especially when he so perfectly illustrates the very meaning of Anglophilemania.

Anyone with cats knows that they tend to throw up on occasion - they have to get those pesky hairballs up somehow. Anyway, we had reached a point where each of our two cats started to throw up every day and it was making our lives quite a bit busier because of the cleanup involved. The cats acted fine, but we were overworked with cleaning up pet messes.

After we decided it was time for a change, I did what I usually do - research the customer reviews to see what people had to say about the Blue Buffalo cat food (there are tons of varieties. I landed on this food and found that most reviews were really positive, with one actually saying his cats stopped throwing up all the time. That got me hook, line and sinker.

So, I'm here to report the same for my cats. We are now on our second bag of this variety of Blue Buffalo cat food (sensitive stomach). Amazingly, the throwing up stopped, except for the occassional hair ball incidents. I can't believe the positive effect this food has had for my cats. They are shiny, healthy looking, and best of all, they aren't throwing up everywhere anymore.

In this film, the film noir aura slowly builds- it even gets progressively darker in asthetic and feel, which is pretty neat. It's sort of like dimming the lights in a room. The acting is superb, as Greer and Mitchum have chemistry, and a young Kirk Douglas does a fine job. Jane Greer is the ultimate femme fatale, with beauty, charm, but a very dark and corrupt side to her.  Out of the Past is essential to your film noir collection.

This book is filled not just with action, but humor and moments of suspense.  I guessed a good portion of what was going on as to me it was rather out there.

I loved that there is a world of good mortal vampires mixed in with those that we already know about, the evil immortal kind.  There seems to be some respect for the Dhampir and I was happy to see that as I read because I was rooting for Rose the whole time.

Letting go
Starting over

Owen Harper is handsome, athletic, and bad to the bone. He smokes. He drinks. He takes drugs, and he has a gun. Or not
If he would let people in, if he would let himself care again, everyone would know he is caring, protective, courteous and honest, but there is a lot of risk in making oneself that vulnerable. It is a lot easier to put on a show so that people don't want to know you.

Kensington (Kensi) Worth is a thoughtful, obedient daughter with a loving close knit family. She is naive and unexperienced. She is a classically trained musician who is solely devoted to her achieving her goals. And then her life, as she assumed it was, is exposed for the lie her family has been living.

Sometimes things aren't black and white. Sometimes what you see is an illusion created by only acknowledging some of the facts while ignoring contrary information.

Owen is Beast to Kensis Beauty. Ginger Scott has created a beautiful balance in these characters. A balance of love and sweetness to darkness and anger. Ms. Scott has again perfectly captured the tumultuous extremes of young adultstheir ability to be thoughtful and giving and then behave like petulant children when confronted with the powerlessness of their age. The cast of secondary charactersfriends, family, town folkgive Owen and Kensi ample opportunity to showcase the depth and breadth of their character, however, it is their unconditional acceptance of one another that lets them really shine. Kensi becomes Owens anchor, and he is her bastion.

Wild Reckless is a well written with purposeful plot points, compelling characters (some engaging and some onerous), ample description to really get the feel of the small town of Woodstock, and a perfect pace that will keep you reading. Ginger Scotts book is deemed YA (young adult) due to its high school setting, however, it has an edgier feel that makes it more appropriate for NA (new adult) audience. My emotions ran the gamut of chuckling to misty-eyed while reading. I highly recommend this ultimately uplifting story of first love and growing up.

9416,"'In Treatment: Season Two', is as riveting as season one. Gabriel Byrne, as Paul, continues as the impassioned psychologist, dealing with a new set of patients.  He sees a female college student with lymphoma, a boy whose parents are divorcing, a female attorney who he was his patient twenty years prior, and an aging company CEO .  Meanwhile, he continues to have both clinical supervision and personal counseling with Gina, Diane Wiest.

Paul struggles with many of the same issues that were difficult for him in season one - - boundaries with patients, his marriage, his relationships with his children and anger and dissatisfaction with his personal and professional life.  On top of that, he is being sued by the father of a patient from Season 1.

TV series do not get any better than this.  As a clinical social worker and marriage and family therapist, I can vouch for the authenticity of the sessions.

8613,"I very much liked the premise of this story; the heroine hiring a date/bodyguard for her father's wedding. And Scarlett and Jackson create quite some heat because from the start, this book is filled with sexy-time.

""I'm going to make you pay for that later.""
""Oh yes? How're you going to do that?""
""On your knees.""

There is more to this couple than the fact they are compatible in bed. Scarlett comes from a wealthy family and is somewhat the socialite, but is grounded with no airs and graces whilst Jackson is the opposite, yes he runs a successful business now, but growing up was tough for him and his two brothers. He has no inclination to settle down but Scarlett unleashes something in him. And he her, because she finds herself being rather honest around him.

""You promised I would scream. And I didn't.""

Hold Me Until Midnight is an engaging read and Christina Phillips has created a likeable couple with a great chemistry, who are hot and sexy together yet not without their vulnerabilities. I think there was the opportunity for more in terms of Jackson's past; what we were privy to brought some emotion and it would have been nice to see this developed a little more, but that said there is scope in the future from his brothers. I also had issues with the time-hop and the fact it came from nowhere; it didn't really flow and I had to re-read to make sure I'd not missed something.

But on the whole this is very promising start to the series, Jackson's dynamic with his brothers was great, the foundations have been laid and I will certainly read Alex and Cooper's stories if we're given the chance. Plus I'd like to meet their Gran, who I actually thought would have been a nice inclusion to this story.

I really love that Silas was able to show Dylan that she also needed help. It may not have been obvious to most people, or even herself, but she was in just as bad shape as he was. This was wonderfully touching, the way they both wanted to help each other.

Talk about a character who is ""down and out"" - that's Austin Carr. I don't think I ever read a character who had so many bad things happen to him. At times, I found it hard to root for him but at other times I wanted him to succeed. I was torn!

It's a good, funny story filled with suspense and adventure. I like that a couple of characters may not be as bad (or as good) as you might think.

What I really loved - there were so many twists and turns you didn't know if you were coming or going. I read this one in a few days and really enjoyed the blend of mystery with humor. It had me laughing at times and cringing at others. It's one of those books you want to read straight through even if it meant missing a few night's sleep.

That's how it was with Big Numbers - twists, turns and a plot to keep readers extremely interested. A great start to the series!

I met Max and Kari in The Exception and loved them even then. Max is Cane's best friend and Kari is Jada's sister. I swooned over Max then and even more now and I thought Kari was sassy and when I found out they would be getting their own book I was very excited.

Max and Kari have been in a relationship for about a year and a half. When they first met Kari was not looking for anymore than some fun or a night but after that first night she had a feeling she would not just walk away. She actually spent the night. Even after  over a year of staying at his house most nights she refuses to move in, she loves Max and that is why she doesn't want it to go further. There is something from her past that she thinks would change their relationship forever, if there is one after it is revealed. She wants Max to have everything and she believes she can not do that.

Max has wanted Kari from the moment he met her. He knows she is holding back from some reason and he will not give up on her. He will not push her but will keep asking her in a subtle way to move in and move forward with their relationship. He is serious but he keeps it light knowing it will happen one day. It has to. Can Max convince her that she is the only one for her?

There are also some complications beyond their relationship that try to get in the way. A family friend that doesn't believe in their relationship and wants to prove it. There are some twists in the story. I liked that we get to see how Cane and Jada are doing and the side stories intertwine into the book.

I, so swooned over Max! He is sexy, loyal, sweet and giving if you know what I mean :-) and Kari is sassy, fun and doesn't take sh*t from anyone. They are one beautiful, sexy feisty couple. I laughed, I cried and wanted to slap someone more than once that was messing with them. Can't wait to see what is next from Adriana.

I have purchased this product in the past and the battery life has always been great - the batteries last until after all of the contents of the bottle have been applied. As other reviewers have mentioned, you don't get a strong stream out of the wand, but for just spraying around the base of the house and sheds, it's more than adequate.

As far as effectiveness goes, all I can say is that, with the exception of spiders, I rarely have insects in the house or the storage sheds and when I do, they've mostly flown in through the front door in the evening when I'm letting the dog in/out. I do have a very low-level, fairly constant, population of spiders in the house.

Daniel Cotton does a nice job of introducing characters at a comprehensible pace so the listener has a chance to identify with them. We start with Dan the reservist who just wants to find his pregnant wife. I really liked the down to earth attitude he had about the whole situation. Then there is Becca the closet nerd, who is a cheerleader. She is the ideal girl, smart, beautiful, and funny, until she does something so horrible that I actually was shocked by this twist. They link up with an elderly couple across the street, which is where the adventure really takes off.

The group heads off to the urban sprawl of downtown, to the hospital where Dans wife has a huge little surprise. At the hospital the initial group meets more survivors, some good, others not so much. This is the one problem I had with the book; I feel it could have been split up so there wasn't this always evolving cast of characters. After they leave the hospital to make their way to Dans uncles farm when they get separated. Dan stumbles into a crazy possessed as a messiah, who wants to kill him. After he escapes, he continues his mission to reunite with his wife where all sorts of interesting things happen along the way.

After he makes his way to the farm, where he meets up with his wife, son, and the original group from the hospital, they start making long term plans to survive. They wall off the neighboring town and farms. They get a real community started. After the winter Bruce (Dans uncle) sets out with a military officer named Rash to find Dans parents. Things go wrong along the way. Thankfully for a group of children and a couple of adults (from the hospital of course) found his journal with directions back to New Castle. Like I mentioned would have better split up but all in all it was a great book. Well thought out and well written, I will be checking out book two.

1143,"I can't get enough of Jack Reacher.  He's smart, he fights like a beast, he acts on a deep sense of justice, and he's rarely wrong.  Lee Child's eleventh book in the Jack Reacher series, Bad Luck and Trouble, is one of the better ones I've read so far.  Reacher gets a coded message through his ATM receipt from an old army buddy.  It turns out someone is picking off members of their unit, so the surviving members gather to figure out why.

Of course Reacher figures it all out.  I said he's rarely wrong.  He has a couple of misses in this one, but they sure move the story along.  I enjoyed the teamwork in Bad Luck and Trouble as he reconnects with his old buddies.  I enjoy the fact that the bad guys get their due.  I enjoy the contrast of Reacher's analytical, observant mind with his cluelessness about technology.  I enjoy Reacher's simplicity; he recognizes that while his colleagues are, on the surface, more prosperous and stable than he is, he isn't missing much by being a homeless drifter.

The body count of Bad Luck and Trouble is substantial.  But Reacher and his pals only off the ones who deserve it.  Some of Reacher's adventures have very limited implications, like justice in a small town or for one family, but this one has huge implications as they uncover a far-reaching terrorist plot.

8654,"Bind Me Before You Go was an enjoyable read, though it felt really short. Everything here happened fairly quickly and had a touch of ""insta-feel"" to it, but Cassidy and David were very likable and had amazing chemistry together, which made the suddenness of it all a bit more palatable.

That's not to say it wouldn't have benefited from being longer; it definitely would have--but what was here was enjoyable nonetheless.

I especially liked David's attitude about their relationship as a whole and Shabari in particular--it was more about trust and equality of both partners, which gave him a less dominant/alpha feel than some of the heroes of the series (not that the whole dominant alpha thing is bad, necessarily, but I did appreciate the difference here for this story).

David's big ""secret"" and the reason why he doesn't believe he'll ever have a lasting relationship seemed a bit out of proportion once it's revealed--it does make more sense once he explains the background to Cassidy, at least, but once I found out what it was I pretty much had a ""that's it??"" reaction.

But since we obviously want them to get together at the end, having it be less of a huge problem worked for that part, at least. ;)

Bind Me Before You Go is book #8 in the Serve series--a few other characters from previous books show up here, but it works well as a standalone, probably in good part because it's the first series book from Ms. Kincaid. It's also my first book by the author--based on this, I'd definitely read her again, especially if a future book in this series is going to be about Leo and Allie, Cassidy's roommate :)

I was graciously emailed by Kristen's PA for the opportunity to read The Hook Up before its release September 8th & I happily accepted.

The title of the story says it all but it was so much more than a simple hook up. It was about self discovery, acceptance, & forgiveness. The main characters learned so much together & of course like other romance story there was angst & drama but there was humor, sassiness, witt, love, & sexual frustration. When Anna & Drew meet for the first it's like this instant connection; an electric chemistry that they can't deny. Oh but Anna sure does try to fight it. Anna is curvaceous with red hair & a mix of Italian & Irish blood. She has trouble realizing her worth, so when Drew finds her attractive & wants more than a simple hookup, which absolutely has Anna running.

Drew is the gorgeous & popular QB of the football team who is your typical jock. He has his insecurities & hook up with girls all the time. So when feelings begin to develop between these two can imagine how that ends.

I recommend this story to anyone who is a fan of college football or just someone who loves a good romance story. There are great secondary characters as well, especially Gray Grayson. There isn't scene where you won laugh with him & love his romance with Drew. This story is funny, sexy, witty, sassy, & filled with angst. 5 STARS!!!

Twenty-five year old Mel lives an ""if it can go wrong, it will go wrong"" existence. I cringed while reading some of the situations she got herself into, especially a job interview. (She has a job but her ex-boyfriend is her boss and he's kind of a tyrant. She got him the job and he broke up with her before his first day.) Mel is also determined to help those around her, but while she has the best intentions, considering how bad she is at managing her own life, she ends up doing more harm than good. These situations were funny, yet painful. Other painful parts of this book involved Mel's family - a younger sister who rubs her perfect life in Mel's face at every opportunity; her father who has ruled Mel off as being a spinster (at 25...) and her mother who is too timid to build up her oldest daughter and defend her from her father's criticism. The best part of this book, in my opinion, was Mel's best guy friend Will. Warm, accepting, protective and perfectly quirky, I adored him and loved that he wore a Star Trek t-shirt since my ex-boyfriend wore one too and it cracked me up.

Axle was part of the Dark Saints MC and he was in one of their bars to check it out when a new waitress came through the back and was manhandled by the uncle of the owner Junior DiSalvo.  Axle headed over there to take care of it but stopped as the woman Uncle Frank was trying to feel up told him in no uncertain terms something in his ear and he let go of her like she was fire crawling up his arm.  Axle thought it was amusing so he wanted to know what she said to him, she smirked at him and told him she could take care of herself.  Right then Axle was impressed and thought she was the hottest thing he had seen in a while.  This was an intense, draw you in type of story that wouldn't satisfy you until you read the last page.

2181,"Kristin Newman and I are polar opposites.  I am a 50+ woman who rarely travels (but hopes to remedy that), who has practically always been in a serious relationship (been married 25+ years) and yet I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I listened to audio version and found it very entertaining.

Kristin Newman is a comedy writer, who instead of settling down, chose instead to travel.  Not just travel, but travel to the fullest.  Seeing and doing everything possible, and that includes lots of relationships with men.  A sort of vactionship - some of them she wished would last longer and some she just enjoyed for the moment.  At some parts, I cringed, worried  at her recklessness with strange men.

She had a saying and Im probably misquoting here, but it was something like, You must do the thing that you must do in the place that you must do it.  I love that.  I referenced that line several times in our recent trip to California.  Her openness to try everything is inspiring and I really did take away a sense of how I might like to change my life - be more open, experience more (minus the sleeping with all the men!).

3151,"Brad Meltzer' s latest novel ties together two of the most interesting people ever united by events in a book.  The first one is a soldier named Nola Brown.  Nola's background includes a childhood marred by the worse treatment ever received by an adopted daughter from the man that became her father.  She was bullied, browbeaten, and treated as garbage.  Her only escape was to join the army.  While there she was chosen to be the Army's Artist in Residence. She had the open ended assignment of going wherever she wanted to and drawing what she saw to be included in the army's record of the battle or the event in order to form a better picture of what occurred.

  The other person is Jim ""Zig"" Zigarowski who works at Dover Air Force Base as a mortician in the section that receives fallen military personnel.  Zig does not treat the position as something to just work at as his day job.  His feelings towards the dead received causes him to labor long and hard at fixing up features of those that combat has disfigured in order to allow next of kin to be able to have open casket burials and find closure in that process.

  Zig knew Nola years ago while she was in high school and saved the life of his daughter.  Later in that period there was a terrible accident that did claim the life of Zig's child and thereby ruined his life.  His wife left him and Zig went deeper into the lonely business of dealing with the dead to ready them for burial.  The novel opens with the news of the crashing of a small plane coming from a secret military base in Alaska.  Among other casualties Zig learns that Nola is among the dead and solicits her  body in order to work on it preparing for the funeral.  He quickly discovers that the corpse is not Nola but someone else and begins his own intensive investigation of what is happening.

  The events depicted by Mr. Meltzer keep the reader glued to the book in order to find out what is going on.  Who is the person killed and, of course, where is Nola?  Both Zig and Nola are very well delineated and their feelings and reactions to events are those that would happen to anyone caught up in those situations.  It is possible that Nola might enter into future novels written by Brad Meltzer but the current book is able to stand on its own and provides an excellent reading experience for those enjoying it.  Very well done.",4,"[-2.533277498994581, -1.2009578981860072, -1.1561480380170983, -0.9923091957584329, -1.2839300293095655]",-0.9923091957584329
9905,"In addition to appreciating the reviews here that speak well of this product's performance and persuaded me to buy it,  I also appreciate its small (5""x3""x2"")size, and that its reader-friendly user guide includes:  (1) Both an easy-to-find list of  the multiplicity of places where you should NOT put a CO detector--which in my smallish house reduces the options considerably--and a (much shorter) list of locations where it should work best, along with easy-to-understand explanations of the whys of all that. (2) That it makes the should-be-easy-to-remember suggestion that you replace its  three  AA batteries every time you reset the clocks and  recommends several brands--presumably ones that  should last at least that long between changes.  (3) That it provides a space on the side of the device to write in  the date, seven years from now, when the device itself needs replacing--a placement where you're most likely to notice it whenever you take it off the wall to change the batteries.

Now, if only monoxide and smoke detector makers could  find more forgiving  ways to call our attention to a shorter-than-expected battery life, or our occasional  maintenance tardiness, than sending us stumbling, bleary eyed and half awake, all over the house in the middle of the night, trying to figure out and silence whichever of our household's protective devices is not only NOT alarmed about anything, but just screaming  its decibels out that it needs a new battery.

In the meantime: 1. Read user guide re placement before picking a spot and drilling holes in the wall.  2. Figure out what this year's time change dates are for where you live and mark them on your calendar with note to replace all detector batteries. 3.

It turns out neither Reese not Eirik were expecting to fall so head over heals for each other.

Reese suffered at the hands of selfish boy friends previously and was expecting Jarl Eirik to be the same as all of the previous men in her life.

1630,"Pros: Stephenson has the ability to extend what we currently know about the world (social and technological), and extend it to some pretty startling conclusions.  Great dialog, great scenes, great inventiveness, good humor.  I will say that if you've read and enjoyed Stephenson's before, then you'll enjoy this book.  If you haven't read  Stephenson, then this is a good book to start with (this is shorter, some of his can be quite long).  If you enjoy this book, then you'll find the rest of Stephenson accessible.

Cons:  When you drop into a ""created"" world, its always a hassle to pick up the new rules, especially in Stephenson's case. I'm sure there's some people who take amusement at sorting out Stephenson's world, and I don't mind it too much, but since Stephenson blends his new terms directly into the story line without breaking away to explain them, it can cause some confusion and back-tracking.  The pace is a little bit annoying in this book.  Sometimes we're covering events on a day by day basis, then boom,  ""after a couple of years had passed...."".

All the people involved are having to face changes in their lives and how maybe nationwide changes can change them.  This book main story is about how each person faces the obstacles in their lives, from career to family to just everyday life.

3065,"Graham Norton has written an engaging first Novel in Holding. Set in a small town Duneen, Ireland, Norton paints an exquisite picture of the counterpoint between familiarity of small town life and the inability to achieve a sense of privacy and anonymity. The challenge of achieving this balance is richly portrayed via the introduction and development of the six main characters and how their lives and emotions are intertwined as big news rocks their small town.

Each chapter has readers periodically checking in on a different character and their emotions as the plot develops. Nortons transitions here are so well done as to be effortless. The flow and pace of his writing is very smooth and makes you want to keep reading to not break the rhythm. Each character is believable with their personalities and idiosyncrasies deftly revealed in a way that makes them increasingly familiar. This connected me in a way that made me feel that I too was a resident. Norton also uses his comedic talent to cleverly and enjoyably deliver a periodic turn of phrase, just enough to leave you longing for the next one.

My one criticism is the plot had little tension. There was no real suspense, sense of foreboding, or danger despite the story being built on the mysterious death of a well known inhabitant. For me, a little more tension or surprise would have made it that much more enjoyable. Upon reflection a few days later, however, I came to realize that the characters would stand up regardless of plot which to Nortons credit is precisely the point.

With more suspense or foreboding, Holding would be a full 4 star read rather than 3.5 stars.",3,"[-2.980075253969974, -1.492488582701852, -1.240460836996604, -0.9931989946728971, -1.3160522950722555]",-0.9931989946728971

After Stout died, an unknown writer named Robert Goldsborough was called upon to try and continue the series.

He did so brilliantly.

So much so, that it would probably be impossible for any but the most astute scholar to tell the difference between vintage Stout and ""upstart"" Goldsborough.

The main character is Hugh de Singleton, who is both a surgeon and bailiff. As I commented on an earlier book in this series, I find the methods of surgery and doctoring in that day fascinating.

This book, Trail of Ink, starts off a bit slowly, but then picked up and grabbed my interest. The story involves stolen books, and I figured it wasn't going to be a story involving murder and mayhem, but I was wrong. Thought it may have been slower getting to the suspenseful moments than the two books that preceded this one, it has a lot of suspense in it also, and even some romance thrown in - although that is also a lot different than modern day romances.

The author has studied medieval surgery and medieval English, and that comes across in the book. Reading his books are like stepping into medieval times. He paints a great picture of what life was like in that day, and adds mystery and suspense to make it even more enjoyable.

I have one complaint about the book. There is a glossary in the front of the book to define some of the unfamiliar words in the book, but there are still several used that are not in the glossary. I would have liked a definition of those also.

5999,"Once again, Alana Terry has created an unpredictable suspense novel that kept me up past my bedtime! Young Harvard student, Kennedy Stern is working hard to keep up with her heavy class schedule when her childhood pastor easily convinces her to do a bit of volunteer work for a new pregnancy center. Taking phone calls over the weekend didn't sound like much work, so Kennedy accepts the outdated phone and proceeds on her way.

Kennedy and her college friends are very well characterized, bringing this compelling story to life. Age appropriate activities are realistically represented as the characters throughout this drama take on their roles believably. One phone call tripped Kennedy's reactions to a very young girl and her unplanned pregnancy. Her concerns are convincing and her compassion for this youngster is commendable. Her actions reflect that of a young adult caught in a very upsetting position.

The hostility between pro-life advocates and pro-choice contenders is a heated conflict at the site of the new pregnancy center and hateful behavior affects a number of individuals. As Kennedy realizes that she doesn't have the time to concentrate on her studies and volunteer for the center, she returns the phone to her pastor and attempts to return to her college life, but that one phone call has changed her life, and she can't forget it.

Life has a way of affecting even our best intentions, and as this collegiate's life is transformed into a nightmare of events, the author builds upon the suspense that continues to escalate to unbelievable levels. There were long moments that I couldn't put this book down! Heartbreaking and unbelievable situations proceeded to a level of near panic.  I highly recommend this fast-paced suspense novel with a Christian perspective. This is the first in a new series for Alana Terry, and  I can hardly wait for the sequel.

611,"There is much of the familiar in Anne Tyler's latest novel, ""Digging to America""; endearing characters, the bustle and flow of family life, and the small wonders of the quotidian world, but much is new here as well. For one thing, the protagonist Maryam is a most unusual ""Tyler woman"". She is small, compact and spare, elegant and soft spoken. She holds herself in and thinks before she speaks. She doesn't trail scarves, tissues and hairpins the way many of Tyler's women do. She's not prescient Justine from ""Searching for Caleb"", nor scatter-brained Maggie from ""Breathing Lessons"", nor a caretaker like Rebecca from ""Back When We Were Grownups"". And Maryam's ""difference"" is purposefully apt, for she is a foreigner. This novel, about two families who become intertwined when they both adopt Korean girls, explores the notions of fitting in, what it means to be ""different"", of what it is to be an ""American"", of what must be lost of the self to join a community. (This last point is amusingly illustrated in an attempt to coerce a tiny Chinese girl into giving up her pacifier.)

Readers familiar with Tyler's work will not be surprised to find that September 11th is given but a glancing swipe. After all, Tyler skimmed past WWII and the Vietnam war in her last novel ""The Amateur Marriage""!  The outside world does not affect Tyler's landscape the way family does. Ever.

This insightful tale of culture clash and will delight all Tyler fans. One can't help but assume that much of this story is autobiographical given that Tyler's late husband was from Iran. That certainly adds credibility to the characters. Also, the candid conversation two characters have about losing a spouse rings very true.  I'm a huge Tyler fan, so she could publish her collected grocery lists and I would love it, but I can honestly offer my opinion that this novel will satisfy any reader interested in what it means to be a part of a whole; country, community or family.",4,"[-3.244551713151985, -1.2591192963295064, -1.0718536360504576, -0.9943370454607116, -1.3474243835842405]",-0.9943370454607116

Having now read the Borgias, I am much looking forward to picking up Meyer's earlier volume and plowing through it as well.  Meyer is a terrific popular historian.  Whether his historical judgements hold up to scrutiny I must leave to specialists to decide.  Assuming there are no glaring errors of fact in The Borgias (as opposed to glaring interpretations; historians will revisit, revise, and interpret after all), then this book seems to me as fine a starting point as any for any Borgia-curious readers out there.  I, myself, am not likely to delve much deeper into this particular chapter of history.

6166,"Tessa Bailey quickly became one of my favorite authors when I was introduced to her books about two years ago.  I have thoroughly enjoyed every single book of hers that I read.  But I have to be honest and say that this novella is probably by far my favorite from her.

Too Close To Call is part of the 1,001 Dark Nights stories and her book features Kyler, whom we met in the third book of Tessa' Romancing the Clarksons series.  He's a sweet, good ol' country boy with a huge future in football.  But none of that matters without his high school sweetheart, Bree; the high school sweetheart who broke his heart when she ended things right as he went away for college.

Tessa wrote these characters perfectly.  Their mannerisms, the way they talk, how they interact with in their hometown, it just makes the story all the more real.  I could so easily picture everything as if I was watching this book play out before.  That's what helped me love this book all the more.  When I met Kyler in Too Hard To Forget, I was praying that he would get some sort of story.  And Tessa melted my heart with this book.

Kyler and Bree's story is one that know has happened before in real life.  It's real, raw and natural and everything played out beautifully.  I love these two characters - they are strong individually but together, they are force to be reckoned with.  Oh and don't let me sweet and saccharine review fool you - these two get pretty damn hot and heavy.  And Kyler shocked me with his naughty mouth.

Instead, The Good Guy is Koontz at his finest:  likeable main characters (yet with tragic pasts), horrific villans, and page-turning conflict between the two.

Of course, Koontz still has some surprises up his sleeve, from revealing both Tim and Linda's secret pasts to finally admitting who Krait is working for.

While the romance between Lenore and Kolbein was nice, it felt too fast for me and they weren't able to spend much time together either.  I liked Lenore's friend, Abrianna, a lot as she and her aunts brought a lot of humor to the story.  She kept getting in trouble because she felt God wanted her to help the poor, even if that meant wandering the streets alone and in bad parts of town.  She talked a lot and both she and her aunts said some ridiculous things with complete seriousness, which just made them funnier.  It was also amusing to watch her try to learn the domestic arts, which she was both horrible at and also disliked.  I liked her deep faith in God and how she wasn't ashamed to share the Gospel; she talked the talk and walked the walk.  The characters had varying levels of faith, from none to a strong faith.  I also liked the hint of romance possibly beginning between her and her lifelong friend, Wade.

3860,"It has taken me way too long to get back to the simple world that Chris Philbrook has created for Adrian. By simple I mean pretty straight forward as far as a zombie apocalypse is concerned.

Beware that this is book 2 in a series, so it might do you some good to listen to the first book first. Even thought I believe that Alone No More can stand by itself if need be.

At first I was taken aback, because this book started in the past. With things that we did not know about from book one. I had to double check that I was listening to the correct audiobook. After this initial shock I found myself getting wrapped up in the added story lines.

If you thought that Dark Recollections was missing the back story of Adrian, you will be pleased to know that Alone No More will quench some of that thirst. Not only with Adrians story but the story of several other interesting characters.

I did find it quite oxymoronic that the title is Alone no More and Adrian was alone for the majority of this story. However when people started showing up in his life again the crap hits the fan. As we all know the most dangerous things in the zombie apocalypse are the other survivors.

Philbrook ended the book at the perfect point to make you need to listen to the next in the series, something that I will be doing soon.

James Foster is simply amazing in this series. There is something magical that happens with his performance when he is Adrian talking, I mean writing, in his journal. True chemistry, he creates a real conventionality, a sincere joviality at times and disparity at others.

Now I am not sure how these two got connected, more than likely random fate or coincidence. I will choose fate because an author needs a stellar narrator to bring his vision to light. Even though Foster is a relative newcomer to the narration world, I can not think of another that would give the listener the same experience.

Though parts of it didn't feel totally accurate--smaller details, mostly; overall it was fairly plausible historical fiction--the story was entertaining and the characters extremely likable. And though I shuddered slightly when Gabriella was hanging out with spiders and beetles (spiders! and beetles!) it was really easy to adore her character anyway. And Raphe...ah, Raphe. You've got to love a guy who's been taking care of his younger sisters since the age of eight and somehow managed to educate all three of them himself. (One of the aforementioned details--where on earth would they get books as penniless, parentless kids living in St. Giles? But still, it's hard not to love characters who get excited by libraries and bookstores, so I'll go with it :))

Also very interesting to note that though there's chemistry galore here and all kinds of lusting after each other, actual sexytimes are sparse. I actually didn't miss it--it was nice to focus on the relationship for a change...plus, chemistry and lust and hot and heavy dreams filled in the gap nicely ;)

Raphe's younger sister Amelia is clearly being set up as the heroine of the next book, and I am so there, people! Can't wait!

461,"On the one hand, Nietzsche must be given credit for pointing out that philosophers have been blind to follow many classic notions such as free will, truth and God. He shows how arbitrary the distinctions between good and evil really are. Needless to say, this is not the easiest work to fully grasp nor does it build a case for an alternative system. Nietzsche is aiming for a re-evaluation of moral values but must first tear down the old system. As such, he contradicts himself many times here and seemingly throws out statements for shock value in this raw and angry work. There are many things to ponder here. Some of these ideas have been stated more simply since this book was originally published. One of his ideas seems to be never to allow or encourage weakness in others (such as poverty, meekness, needing compliments, etc.) which he sees connected to mainstream religion, philosophy and society at large. He argues if we truly love we must honor beauty and strength as the pagans had done over 2,000 years ago. Nietzsche was the first philosopher to ask his questions so boldly and clearly without the trappings of metaphysics.

Beyond Good and Evil is such an important work but there is much more to know about Nietzsche and his ideas. The book has been accused to being ""soulless"" because there is only the individual will to power left after many conventional societal values have been torn down. I'm not disagreeing with the ideas or conclusion but Nietzsche may have been too optimistic in laying responsibility squarely on individuals themselves. We do not have a history of managing power particularly well. The book is full of unusual aphorisms and some hot commentary that still shocks people even today.

I have the Penguin Classic version where it is obvious Nietzsche's voice has been toned down by the editor. Some passages are left untranslated into English while others show obvious tampering where sexism is implied. That slows down the read and changes the feel of the work so check the version before you buy.

Cassanda Bainbridge is engaged to Geoffrey Giles, who ultimately becomes the Earl of Whittaker after the death of his brother. When Cassandra calls off her engagement due to an accident which causes her to have burns, she travels to the country where she focuses on her other love, ballooning. Even before her accident, she was more interested in reading about ballooning than doing the typical girl things, like sewing and attending a party. As could be imagined, her ex-fiancee Geoffrey would rather her keep her feet on the ground in order to stay safe.

Cassandra and Geoffrey were both characters I liked, although I think I liked Geoffrey more than the heroine. He really cared for Cassanda regardless of the scarring she experienced due to her accident. He was also a great boss with an interest in doing what was best for the factory workers. I read the first book in this series, but even if I had not read the book, I would have been able to follow the story of Cassandra and Geoffrey.

Box would bring her back so I was happy to find her here, in Badlands, accepting the job as an investigator with the Bakken County Sheriff's Department in Grimstad, North Dakota. And not only is Cassie back, so is the Lizard King, the biggest and baddest of the bad guys from The Highway, whose continuing story is relegated to the background while Cassie and her colleagues in Grimstad deal with a drug war.

Like all of C.J. Box's books, Badlands pulls you into the story with a great setting, compelling characters, and a fast-moving action-filled plot. I think Badlands, like The Highway, is a bit grittier and darker than most of Box's Joe Pickett novels, but Cassie has a lot in common with Joe. She is a persistent, determined, tough, heroine who is willing to take a risk to get the bad guy - all while remaining very human and less than perfect.

If you have enjoyed C.J. Box's other books, I think you will like Badlands. If you're a fan of fast-paced police procedurals, I recommend this one. It is not essential to have read The Highway in order to enjoy Badlands, but I suggest that you do, anyway.

4 stars
M/M Romance
Triggers: Accident involving death and coma, constant medical neurological condition
I was given this book for an honest review by Wicked Reads.

Hmmm, this was my first introduction to Aicher's style.  I liked it fairly well.

Grady is just all kinds of mysterious.  I like how he is loyal to his friends, family and job, however, he is so complicated at times that he almost seemed immature.  While I can understand why he was so upset by the accident, especially one that almost cost him his only family connection, he also was so back and forth about what he wanted, how he was feeling that I got whiplash at times.

Then you have Micah.  Yum.  While he has his own story, his own complicated history, he was my favorite character in this story.  He was the rock that the water rushed around, but he was never moving.

The two characters have pretty good chemistry - they have a kink that compliments each other and they also have the ability to just be friends too, which I think, strengthens their bond.

While I was somewhat annoyed at the back and forth of the characters' feelings and desires, in the end, the story resulted in a relatively well wrapped package.  I look forward to reading about the other members.",3,"[-2.4305377026748074, -1.7744516549704596, -1.17510261008049, -0.9971467883682036, -1.200672091889032]",-0.9971467883682036

Amy, who was prematurely unfrozen, is trying to come to terms with life aboard the ship and misses her family and being on Earth. When it looks like they might be closer to their destination than anyone thought, she becomes excited and will do anything to get off the ship. Meanwhile Elder tries to be the best leader he can be, but was he born to lead?

I absolutely loved the first book, Across the Universe. I seem to read a lot of YA fantasy but not a lot of YA science fiction and that's part of my strong affection for this series. The other part is that the idea of leaving earth in Godspeed for another planet, hopefully a better planet, is such a fantastic idea and I've loved watching this play out.

For me, A Million Suns was even better than the first book. Across the Universe  set up the story and it really developed into a fast-paced thrilling story in A Million Suns. Through Elder and Amy we learn more about the secrets behind Godspeed and some of the secrets were definitely edge-of-the-seat earth-shattering! There were quite a few ""Oh My"" moments as I read faster and faster to the thrilling end.

I liked Elder a little less in A Million Suns. He needs to stand up and be a leader and he has to make some tough decisions, but there was something that didn't quite connect with me. However, I continue to like Amy. She's so anxious to get off Godspeed at any cost and she faces some tough decisions in this book and comes out on top.

133,"TRAIL BY FIRE by J.A. Jance is the fourth book in the Ali Reynolds series and by far the best one. I had stopped reading Jance after trudging through the first three titles of this once favorite author, but with the current offering Jance lets her talent for characterization roam free. Hence, a much stronger suspense/thrill novel.
The plot is complex without digging around to create problems for Ali Reynolds to endure, which for the first three made the reader feel burdened.
Jance allows Ali to let go of self and focus her concerns on other characters in the story, which is a relief. This is a good read as Ali takes a temporary job as media consultant to the local sheriff's office and uses her talents to defuse situations from the other side of the media fence. Several threads extend Ali's story, but do not over power the mystery/suspense of the novel.
An excellent work in which to explore what puts Jance at the top of the game.

Two decades after the relationship becomes a missed opportunity, Adam receives an email that could potentially change his life.

Adam should have learned his lesson after Angelina slipped away from him the first time around.  The Best of Adam Sharp is the story of lost loves and second chances.

Adam is a guy who could never quite get over the fairy tale, but decades later, he was given the opportunity to explore what he lost.

In the case of A Marriage in Middlebury, I was in the mood for something light and frothy, yet as fragrant as the teas that Charlotte serves in her tearoom, and Anita Higman definitely delivers.

Charlotte Rose Hills tearoom is at the heart of Middlebury. Her gift of blending teas for specific people as well as making them feel at home in her establishment set the tone of the novel, really contributing to the small-town charm of Middlebury.

I really enjoyed the cast of characters in the story. Some were quirky, some were sweet and they all had a story to tell. These characters were flawed but remained endearing. I usually don't care for novels with lots of secondary characters, but their sub-plots became more engrossing to me than even Charlottes story  perhaps because I secretly believed there would be a happily-ever-after for her, and I wasn't disappointed!

1140,"The Enemy is Lee Child's eighth Jack Reacher novel, but the first that takes place during his time as an Army M.P. major.  The first seven books gave many hints about his time in the Army.  The Enemy features the same Jack Reacher we have come to know and love, who does what is right, even if he knows there will be consequences.  The Reacher who always seems to bed beautiful women, but never gets attached.  The Reacher who ""said nothing.""  The Reacher who puts the pieces of the puzzle together against the odds.

The differences are striking, and sometimes amusing.  This Reacher in The Enemy is under command.  He goes where he's told--except for those times when he doesn't go where he's told.  This Reacher will sometimes throw out clothes rather than wear them again, but, since he's serving in active duty and all, he actually carries luggage when he travels!  (Readers of other Reacher books will get that this is a big deal.)

In The Enemy, Reacher investigates the death of a general--until he is told not to.  But he does anyway.  Then a soldier is murdered on base, and he investigates that--until he's told to falsify the investigation.  But he doesn't.  His new superior officer tracks him down to have him arrested for going AWOL, even though he really wasn't.  But Jack, being Jack, manages to escape their clutches.

The Enemy shows Jack as the other books don't, as an official investigator, rather than a lone operator, vigilante type.  I won't be giving anything away when I tell you Jack figures it all out in the end, and is vindicated for his disobeying orders, for the most part.  Jack's conclusions lead him to a great deal of disillusionment with the Army.  Even though he's still in at the end, Child set him up for a break at some point.  I noticed the new Reacher novel, to be released in November, is set before Jack leaves the Army.

The story revolves around their growing relationship and the emerging problems with her friend's dad and his MC plus the Feds are pushing in. There's a rat and some think it's her. Her father double crossed them before he died and stole from them.

482,"I usually don't read romance novels but the description of this one intrigued me since it was about women across several countries during WW II. It's been a while since I read it so I don't remember all the names of characters, etc. and don't want to give a lot away anyway. I would describe this as a potboiler, for those of you who are old enough to know what that means. It's pretty well written although a bit hard to follow at first because Helen Bryan introduces so many characters in the first few chapters. There is a little mystery in it that is resolved at the end of the book. Bryan does give a good look into the lives of everyday people, especially the women, during the war, especially in rural England. Even though it's not a genre I typically care for, I did like the book - didn't love it, but liked it. The ending was worth reading the book for. If you'd like to learn more about what life was like for the women left behind by their soldier men, and don't want to find a text book approach to the topic, this book is for you. If you like soap opera/potboiler types of novels, this one's for you. If you like mysteries (my favorite genre) there is a small mystery in the plot (that isn't too hard to figure out early on) but it's not the focus of the plot so this may not be for you.

Rick, the main character, not only remembers a particular Christmas, but unearths repressed memories that make him realize just how much he had forgotten - about his mother, his father and especially his step-father, Art. When Rick has to go home to take care of his mother Leanne and Art's store, after Art suffers a brain aneurysm, he must confront these memories and truly remember what he owes to them.

There is also a sweet, romantic side-story that I thought was done well, especially considering the male author. I did not expect the big plot-twist at all, and though it could have come across as unrealistic or cheesy, it felt very natural in the progression of the story.

One thing I also have to touch on is the setting - who would have thought that a Florida setting of the fictitious town of Seabreeze would have been cozy, but it is! The setting really enriched the story. The Book Nook store that Rick's parents own felt so realistic to me, and I longed to visit it myself as well as the small, coastal town.

Hetty Deveraux is left a house located in Scotland's Outer Hebrides, which is a series of islands, after a distant relative dies. She has plans to renovate and turn the house into a hotel. Unbeknownst to her the house is a crumbling mess and will cost a fortune to rebuild.

Upon arriving at this house that can only be accessed when the tide is out, Hetty realizes just how difficult her intentions are. There has been a body found among the rubble that appears to have been there a long time. Not only will there need to be massive renovations but the locals do not want her to be there. They want things left as they are and let the sea claim the house. What is the identity of the body and what is the story?

Theo Blake brought his wife, Beatrice, to the house around 1910 as newlyweds. Theo is a painter who is famous for his work but is now chronicling the local bird population with paintings. He has a local man assisting him with this project. Beatrice is often left to her own devices as her husband is so wrapped up in what he is doing that he neglects and seems to push his bride away. She finds companionship with the local man.

Hetty slowly uncovers the secrets of the Blake's, the small community and its inhabitants all at the same time trying to figure out exactly what she should do with the property. Developers are pushing her one way but her heart is pulling her in another.

The House Between Tides reminds me of books written by Phyllis Whitney, Victoria Holt or Mary Stewart in that they all have the same style of writing, moody, dark and atmospheric stories that involve romance and mystery where the male characters are often brooding and the women are bound to fall in love them in spite of their moodiness and mystery.

709,"This book offers a fascinating look at the ways in which people have thought about autism, and how it came to be diagnosed. At over 500 pages, this book covers tremendous ground, but it is far more interesting than one might expect a history of a medical and psychological diagnosis to be. At the center of this book are a group of parental activists and scientists who have pushed for funding and research. Indeed, much of the agency in this book goes to the parents, who have tirelessly sought recognition, therapies, and funding for their children. As with most social movements, that for the recognition and research of autism has been riven with controversy and division, and these fractures are well-covered in the book, including the recent vaccine controversy. What I found most interesting, though, was the early material. Aside from the blaming of ""refrigerator mothers,"" I knew very little about early conceptions of autism.

While this book is quite long and covers a great deal of ground, it is important to understand its limitations. This is not a book about what it is like to have autism, or what it was like earlier in the twentieth century. Though we get some hints into the lives of children with autism, that is not the focus here. What is the focus is how a scientific field and a rights movement was created, as parents worked to secure basic rights for their children (most notably, the right to attend school), and tried to persuade scientists to study the syndrome. This is also a book focused heavily on cases at the more severe end of the autism spectrum. While there is discussion of how the spectrum concept came to be, and the recognition (and later de-recognition by the DSM) of Asperger's Syndrome, much of the work that this book chronicles was undertaken by the parents of children most severely affected.

The book is engagingly written, and the authors' style is inherently readable. Recommended for anyone interested in how the autism diagnosis came to be.",4,"[-3.048255734645813, -1.789838747263171, -1.2395760263441822, -0.9999890068506625, -1.3680206831625417]",-0.9999890068506625

1939,"I have never read any other books or articles or seen any television shows by Shawn Achor before reading this book. His ideas make a lot of sense to me but I almost feel like I need a seminar to take what I have read and really make it work in my life.  This is not a simple self-help book full of positive ideas on how to be happy, but rather an, at times, almost technical look at how happiness happens.

The author uses a five step approach to get a person to the point where they can experience happiness. For me the steps are as follows:

1. Have a willingness to look at things differently to open up more paths to being happy;
2. Define what matters most in life and what will bring you happiness and then have a plan to make these goals happen;
3. Find ways of moving more quickly to these goals;
4. Don't allow other happenings interfere with reaching these goals; and,
5. Help others around you see the importance of your goals so you are not experiencing them in a vacuum.

The author uses personal experiences and psychological studies to explain his views on happiness. His logic is sound and even the technical aspects of what he was saying was understandable.

I do think I was at a slight disadvantage having never read or seen anything by the author. I will  watch his show on PBS and will read more of what he has written.

I am glad I read this book and will attempt to use what I have learned in my life.

Matt is a bit lost just trying to figure things out, but what he does know is that once he accepts something he is all in, he doesn't care what other people think and he tells it like it is which is definitely one of my favorite features about him.

Alex is a sweetie with allot of patience. He deals with Matt and his mood swings and let's anything he says just roll off of him knowing that doesn't ever really mean it in a bad way. He's got secrets and it gave the story quite the twist when they came out.

Their reunion after twenty five years opens up a lot of baggage that contains items not in the clothing category.

Finding one's place in the world is hard enough for anyone, but it's especially challenging for Deming. Abandoned by his mother, an undocumented Chinese immigrant, at the age of 11, Deming is then adopted by a well-meaning older American couple who change his name to Daniel and lay out clear expectations about the path his life will follow.

Once Deming reaches young adulthood, he's understandably plagued by the circumstances of his life. Not only does he lack a true sense of identity and purpose, but he can't let go of the memories of his mother and why she left him.

After getting in touch with an old friend, Deming finds a lead on his mother's whereabouts, and this further disrupts his aimless life.

The Leavers is told from the perspective of both Deming and his mother, Polly, giving the reader the opportunity to understand both of these characters. Gradually, we learn the truth about why Polly left Demingand it turns out it's more complicated than it originally appeared.

One of the things I appreciate most about this novel is that there are no easy judgments or convictions to be reached about the characters. They are flawed, they make bad decisions, they hurt each other. And yet they are each deserving of empathy. Life is complicated, and not everything can be neatly categorized as right or wrong. Sometimes things just are what they are, and we do what we can to keep moving forward.

This is, for the most part, a compelling character-driven novel that ranks somewhere in the middle of the immigration literature from the past few years. There are times when the dialogue is stilted, the pacing off, and the transitions from Deming's to Polly's perspective too abrupt, but the themes of belonging and reckoning with one's past are handled with the complexity they deserve.",3,"[-2.0583416656308637, -1.1120674668478319, -1.257484053933366, -1.0009686854757986, -1.2851462624375696]",-1.0009686854757986

Lynn has raised Lucy as her own, and their affection for each other is evident. Unfortunately, their lives are soon torn about by an outbreak of polio and the sudden destruction it brings. Lucy may be a carrier, so they set out to California to escape what's left behind and in search of something new. Their journey takes them across the Midwest, through the Great Plains and over the mountains. In this book Lucy is the central figure, rather than Lynn and I do think it suffers a bit from that. Lucy's life has been easier than Lynn's at the same age, and I just didn't find her as compelling a character. That being said, this is still an excellent read. Both characters are very believable and it's refreshing to see a positive relationship between a young woman and her mother figure.

Our amateur sleuth, Pippa, runs Moorehaven.  She is determined to find the killer. Shes even more determined when the handsome stranger is accused of murder. It doesnt stop her attraction for the man, which only makes Pippa even more determined to prove his innocence.

Pippa gets help from her mystery writer guests who are more than happen to solve a real-life crime for a change. Perhaps even use their experience in their own work.

Pippa and her crew discover their small town has more secrets than they ever imagined possible. They need to sort through the myths and realities of Seacrest to get to the truth and find a killer before anyone else is hurt.

The story moves at a steady pace, for the most part. There were some spots that I felt moved a bit slowly when learning about the towns history, but it is all necessary to figure out what is going on with the current day mystery.

The author gives us a delightful cast of quirky characters. They are always up to something. Theres also a dash of romance thrown into the mix to make a captivating story. This is the first book in a new series. Its off to a great start.

3.5 stars
M/M Biker, Romance
I was given this book for an honest review by Inked Rainbow Reads.

This is the second book in this series and despite my enjoying the story, I did not like it as much as the first installation of this series.

Greg is a nerdy, computer genius who has developed a relationship with Snake.  (I use Snake, because the two MC names are too similar when read together.  Greg and Gene - when reading them so close together, they look too similar, so that was another sticking point for me.)  Greg's past relationships have not ended well - he is uncomfortable with who he is.  Despite his big brain and methodical way of working, he knows that he is not the most fit person.  His shell is cracked by Snake - a rough, tough biker, undercover who's only contact is with Greg.  I really liked watching Greg come out of his shell.  He seemed to almost blossom with Snake.

Snake is a character from the previous book.  I like him much more in this story - he's less grumpy.  He's still his crass self, but Greg softens him a lot.  His demeanor changes throughout this story, mainly because of the mystery that they are trying to solve.  He has a take charge personality, but doesn't impose on Greg too much - only when they are in the bedroom or on the phone.

I wish that we would have had more phone and dirty talk - it seemed that they hinted at it, but it was never full blown in the story.  Their chemistry was great - the sex was both necessary and entertaining.

The secondary characters were plentiful.  It was sometimes hard to keep track of who was who - which made the story somewhat cumbersome.  I didn't mind the timeline chapters in the first book, but in this one I found them kind of hard to follow.  I think this would have been more powerful and less confusing had it just been written without the dates.

The mystery was also somewhat strange and even though it was wrapped up nicely, it seemed a little anticlimactic.

This was a decent story, but not my favorite by Jessie.",3,"[-2.021885229464796, -1.7069786976911563, -1.0017297562583074, -1.0048854935683431, -1.0449187630361778]",-1.0017297562583074
2825,"I've read the Stage Dive series, loved it. I love Kylie Scott's funny but tugging-at-your-heart-strings style that's unique. A really good combination of funny and feels.

Dirty is a book with a lot of humor in it. Sometimes, it's laugh-out-loud, otherwise it's the embarrassing kind, but you're still chuckling and then there are the ones that make you groan and laugh.

But let's talk about the story and the characters. We met the hero, Vaughan, in Deep. He was in the band that opened up for Stage Dive on their tours. Thing is, the band's broken up and Vaughan heads home, to a house that's been sitting empty, for a while now, with a lot of memories.

Now the heroine... Lydia was about to make the biggest mistake of her life but she ran away, before she did it. Man, certain scenes pissed me off so much but she's awesome, she takes crap from no one and stands up for herself. Of course, she could have done way more but that would have landed her into a lot of trouble so, it's better she didn't.

The way they meet is both funny and sad. Well, the circumstances are. Their chemistry is something you can feel, I mean Vaughan cannot keep his eyes off of Lydia and her chest. I loved the side characters and I cannot wait for book two.

But I think I said enough and it would be best to read it, see for yourself.

I hesitated a little after first starting this book because I knew I had recently read a novel about an oil rigger in the North Atlantic which was a cover for something going on beneath and I thought maybe I had already read it. No, this was wonderfully different and so much better than the other book (can't remember its title offhand).  Peter Crane is led to believe one thing, then another and finally the truth about what is happening at the bottom of the ocean's floor.  There is so much security that the reader gets the feeling that it is not necessarily good but that there may be some kind of cover-up.  Peter is a Doctor who is brought in to help figured out what is causing the strange sicknesses taking place among the crew.  He is like a detective, hunting for the commonality to these illnesses which vary so much that there seems to be nothing in common.  Because of the security, at times his hands are tied and has to weigh his signed non-disclosure agreements against the danger that may be present.  He walks a fine line between being loyal to his own military allegiance and his desire to help save people.  I like all the twists in this book as the reader too is trying to figure out what is really going on in the ""facility"" under the drilling site.  Kept me on the edge of my seat and was brought to an understandable conclusion.

Changez, a Princeton graduate, had secured a coveted job at a prestigious firm, Underwood Samson, determining the value of other businesses and was in love with Erica, who was in love with her deceased boyfriend.
The conversation was essentially a monologue of how Changez realized the rage he felt against America's imperialistic foreign policies.  Following his joyful appreciation of 9/11, his life began to unravel, leading to his being fired from his job, and ultimately returning to his family in Lahore, Pakistan where he becomes a professor involved in anti-American rallies.
Changez' hold on reality is tenuous.  In his desperation to connect with Erica, he offers to have her pretend he is her deceased lover.  That is the second and last time they will make love.  It is very clear that no matter what he felt about America, he would have stayed here had been able to win Erica's love.  He couldn't and he turned his rage elsewhere.  It made a very intelligent character, too transparent.

The Blackhawk Boys are a group of friends playing on their university football team. Arrow and Brogan are best friends since childhood. When both of them fall for the same girl, Mia Mendez, their friendship is put to the test. Mia is a hard working girl from the wrong side of the tracks. Her life has not been easy, living in a trailer with her alcoholic father and a brother in prison for drug dealing.  But she is determined to make a better life for herself. Even if she is Brogans girlfriend, she is attracted to Arrow.

Arrow is the rich kid from the group. He has it all, the looks, the money and a promising football career. Brogan is the closest thing hes ever had to a brother. However he wants Mia more than anything else.

Misunderstandings, jealousy and bad choices will have tragic consequences and destroy lives after a hit-and-run accident.
Because of his feelings of guilt, Arrows life is spinning out of control. After a stay in a drug rehab center, he has to serve a house-arrest sentence.  Arrow and Mias life will never be the same but can Mia help him and identify the person responsible for the accident?

Overall, this story was intense, deeply emotional and tragic. So don't expect funny banter between students in this book. It ended rather abruptly, but on a note of hope for Arrow and Mia.

I like sports-centric inspirational kind of movies but I was a bit concerned that this might be a bit too preachy for my tastes.  But in reality the message has been toned down to the point so that it really doesnt try to push the concept of faith down your throat.  This movie is in the vein of other similar style of football movies but isn't quite as flashy as those and maybe not as strong overall but I really like the message that it tries to convey that sports is not the most important thing in life and whether you win or lose isn't what you will be remembered for but how you handle those situations in life.  Although this isn't my favorite football/sports type movie, the story is well done and based on real events and has a good message.

And so begins the story of Cyril Avery, whose life is full of humor and tragedy. At a young age, Cyril develops feelings for his best friend Julian. But growing up in the second half of the 20th century in conservative Ireland, he has no choice but to hide his sexuality during his formative years.

This 500+ page saga follows Cyril from when he's a little boy to an old man, taking us from Ireland to Amsterdam to New York City at the peak of the AIDS crisis and back to Ireland.

The plot relies heavily on serendipity, and I recommend accepting this about it early on. For example, Cyril has recurring run-ins with Catherine throughout his life, neither of them knowing who they are to each other. This sometimes borders on twee, but not distractingly so.

Cyril is such a fully realized character that it's a pleasure to spend so many pages with him, laughing and cryingoften at the same time.

207,"Alex Dryden is apparently the pseudonym of a journalist with long experience covering Russia--15 years in the country--and security matters. Though it's not clear what the point of the pen name is since his picture is posted online and a set of cover blurbs from Steven Fry, Hugh Laurie and Emma Thompson--all of whom were in Footlights Theater at Cambridge--suggests a certain commonality of background. At any rate, Whoever he is in real life, the author must have felt his non-fiction dispatches were being ignored, because Red to Black is essentially an anti-Putin polemic cast in the guise of a novel. And a pretty good one at that.

Finn is an MI6 agent in Russia with a very useful mole in the government. Anna, the youngest female colonel in the KGB, is offered up as a honey trap. But the two fall in love and over a period of years work to expose The Plan, a long term effort by members of the Russian security services to achieve by more capitalistic and acquisitive means the subversion of Europe that the USSR so spectacularly failed at. Dryden portrays a Russia on the march, using its energy resources to triumph over a recumbent Western Europe. Anyone familiar with Russia's own demographic crisis will find it even harder to take the bear seriously now than we did twenty years ago, but the analysis of why the USSR fell and what Putin and company would like to achieve is lucid and compelling. It's a fair warning, if perhaps an overblown one.",3,"[-2.0211705967993763, -1.6455443946536383, -1.0804546735801688, -1.0028856150225203, -1.326798605539295]",-1.0028856150225203

7064,"Robert Whitlow has become a go-to author for me with his reliably entertaining legal fiction.  Life Support did not disappoint with the elements that make Whitlow's books page turners: likable but complex characters, dramatic legal cases, detailed legal proceedings that drive the story without bogging it down, and a strong faith element.

In Life Support a young couple goes on a hike in a remote area.  The wife, Rena, who struggles with issues from her childhood, pushes her husband over a cliff.  Thinking he was dead, Rena calls the police to report his ""accidental"" fall.  To her horror, he survives, but is in a coma.  She finds a confidant and defender in Alexia Lindale, a lawyer for her husband's family.  Alexia is forced to choose between the firm and Rena.  She sides with Rena in a battle over maintaining her husband's life support, and becomes entangled in the whole family business.

Rena proves to be a difficult client who, Alex learns, tends to lie--a lot.  Whitlow sets Alex up as a smart, effective lawyer.  Her specialty is divorce, particularly uncovering husbands' lies as they try to cover up their activities and assets.  So she's predisposed to believe Rena, who pulls the wool over Alex's eyes, showing Alex not to be as smart as we may have thought.

As with his other novels, Whitlow allows the characters' Christian faith to be an element in the story without cheapening either the story or the gospel.  Alex meets a local music minister and, through his influence, finds faith.  Together they experience the healing power of prayer.  Not to give any spoilers, but before you read Life Support you should recognize that it's part 1 of 2.  It ends with a major cliffhanger.

Sarah Fairfax has been distanced from her former step-family for two years, cut off by her step-mother at the age of eighteen. Now Rebecca is summoning her back and she wants a little favor. Dimitri Brokov is Sarahs former step-brother, the object of her desires, and his company is a topic of interest to his mother. She wants Sarah to spy on Dimitris accounting practices, and thus Sarah and Dimitris lives become intertwined once again.

Dimitri is certainly alluring.  He curses in Russian during sex, is alpha in and out of the bedroom, and projects a devilishly flirtatious yet cocky attitude. Until taking this job from her step-mother, Sarah has walked the straight and narrow, but she knows the dark and dangerous side that Dimitri has played.

I loved how the story focused on just them, the drama coming from their dangerous ties.  The taboo step-sibling aspect isn't exaggerated for unnecessary angst as theres plenty of excitement with this action-adventure plot and steamy, dirty scenes. While Dimitri is obviously quite talented between the sheets as evident by the detailed times they spend there, hes thankfully never characterized as a manwhore, just a bad boy on the ruthless side. On top of their hot scenes together, theres a little swoon-worthy confession from him towards the end that was a pleasantly surprising plus.

While at first I thought the premise was a little shaky, there was an interesting twist that I didn't see coming that propelled the story on a bit of a mystery arc which added some intrigue to the seriously super sexy tale.  I wouldnt have minded a few more flashbacks from their past to see how it all starteda prologue would have been fitting. The story is told solely from Sarahs first person point of view, but a few chapters would have benefited from Dimitris narration.

But all in all, its a steamy read with danger and intrigue that should keep you turning pages as you root for Sarah and Dimitri to uncover the truths and conquer the true bad guys.",3,"[-2.6914289629185957, -1.1244899879852568, -1.0380983794681085, -1.0036696616064162, -1.1613865619172308]",-1.0036696616064162

Since the death of his parents, Cade Fournette lives with his younger brother and sister and their uncle in a trailer on the Louisiana side. His family is poor and he has to resort to poaching to feed them. One day, during his nightly activities, he meets Monroe Kirby, a young girl living with her mother on the Mississipi side of Cottonbloom. Terrified, she ran away from home after being molested by her mothers boyfriend. Cade doesnt hesitate to threaten the man to convince him to move out of town. Cade is a real knight in shining armor, protecting his younger siblings and his new friend Monroe. But Cade is forced to leave Cottonbloom, in search of a better future. Monroe has never forgotten him and still treasures the memory of their nights under the cottonwood tree.

Ten years later, Cade is finally back. A successful and ruthless entrepreneur owning an engine design company based in Seattle, his life is bigger and more exciting than anything Monroe could imagine. Cade has no intention of staying, but being around Monroe leaves him feeling off-balance. He is fascinated by her, she is honest, selfless and independent. During his absence, she has learned to protect herself and is a double black belt in jujitsu and karate!

Cade and Monroe complete each other perfectly. Circumstances have separated them, and they have been lonely for years. Now that they are reunited, their funny banter was delightful, their attraction intense. Both are confused about the storm of emotions they feel for each other. Their friendship is becoming so much more. But despite all his professional achievements, Cade still has feelings of inadequacy. Will he be brave enough to acknowledge that all he ever wanted or needed is still in Cottonbloom ?

Engaging characters, a beautiful story that kept me turning the pages, a perfect small town feel and flawless writing, this book has it all. So kudos to Laura Trentham for this new series and Im glad Sawyer and Tally, Cades siblings, will get their own stories, because I wanted to stay in Cottonbloom for a longer time !

Indeed one can understand why the US is losing this war and why it may never have really been winnable in the first place.

Let me explain the four stars though before going further. Though the writing was excellent and I felt that I was almost there in the dusty valleys of Afghanistan, there was something missing, some connection between the large scales and the small scales. There is a fair amount of effort expended in the book to make those connections, but they weren't always successful. I found myself looking at maps and photo essays (not included in the book) that I found online to really understand the text. I honestly think this would be a better book with a bunch of large and small scale maps, photos of the terrain, and shots of just what the villages look like. Failing that, and it would be a very different book with those additions, do read this alongside your computer so you can look up those photos and those maps. Most every location cited in the book brings up a huge batch of images with a quick online search.

With that out of the way, let me praise Junger's writing. There's an empathy with the soldiers with which he's traveling that is quite obvious (ignore the reviews that harp about liberals traveling around with the troops, there's no fawning here, but there's never a hint of either condemnation or condescension here) but the hard, factual story is also on the page.

The author explains her intricate plot weaving in a note at the end, and it is obvious that a lot of research and time went into bringing this book together. I was surprised at the connections between characters, and I must admit that I'm not quite sure what to think of the conclusions inferred about the biblical history of these characters. However, when looking at this story for what it is--biblical fiction--I think the author presents a powerful message in a clever way.

I also have to admit that this book almost reminded me of a combination of historical fiction and fantasy. That is not to say that the book presents unbelievable elements, but rather that the settings and situations were presented in a hard-to-picture and unusual way. The descriptions of the buildings, of the ""mountain"" of ashes and dung, etc. were a bit strange for me to imagine in my mind.

All in all, though, Love Amid the Ashes is an intricate story that reminds readers of the sovereignty and majesty of God, as well as the hope of His love and grace.

We meet Lyla Wilder, college chemist, who is anything but plain but she has her own style.  She does not show a lot of skin as a rule from growing up, she never out grew it, even though she is away at college.  But all of that changes when she realizes, she has never had a true college experience.  She has her best friend, sex as sin hockey player, Beck Davenport, to help her with this little list of hers.

Beck Davenport, lives and breathes hockey along with endless hit and run style nights with the ladies.  But that makes his life less complicated.  He has too much in his real life to handle once he gets done with college.  He will have so many people looking up to him to do the right thing.  All he wants to do is play hockey, have casual sex and hang with his best friend, Lyla, on Sunday for movie night.  She is the only one that Beck is truly just himself around.

But when Lyla brings Beck into making her list of things to do while in college, he knows that he will be there to hold her hand through them all.  As they start out on this journey, Beck realizes that there is so much more to Lyla that her smartness and brains.  She is smoking hot.  She brings feelings that he did not realize he had.

As they continue to check things off the list, Beck realizes that he wants to help Lyla with them all, including having a night of wild sex.  They can still be friends, right?

693,"It is Duncan's senior year at the Irving Academy, which means he will face the dreaded Tragedy Paper, the school equivalent of a senior thesis.  When Duncan moves into his room on the first day, he finds something interesting left behind by Tim, the albino student who lived in that room the year before.  Duncan soon becomes obsessed with the story of Tim's downfall the previous year, and learns for himself what tragedy really is.

This book had a very interesting concept.  You have one setting hosting two parallel stories, with two sets of characters.  You have Duncan's present day story, his relationships and struggles during his own senior year.  Then you have Tim's story from the prior year, which is presented around the context of Duncan's story.  At the end of the book, the two storylines merge into one.  I liked the two different points of view, I thought they played off of each other well.

I was really fascinated by Tim's character.  Albinism is a topic on which I know very little, so I actually learned a bit by reading a book where a main character is an albino.  Tim's albinism figures heavily into the story, but it is clear that he is more than just his albinism.  I thought both Tim and Duncan were very well developed as characters, but Tim was the stronger of the two for me.  I found the female characters in the book a tiny bit flat, and never really cared about their parts of the story.  There was a certain amount of literary symbolism in the book, and more than a slight nod towards Shakespeare.  However, one did not get bogged down by the symbolism, and I liked that subtlety.

I think this is a great book for young adult readers, and would make for an interesting lesson plan if paired with Macbeth.  The book has enough depth to appeal to adult readers as well.

I've read the first two in this series and really loved them. So I was very excited when I had the chance from the author to read and review this book before it was released! I'm a huge fan of romance novels and this one definitely fits. We catch a little glimpse of Erin and Troy's chemistry in the second novel when he takes care of her after a fire at a local restaurant/bar. However, it's really just a hint at something, and we don't get to see anything develop until their story starts in this novel. Troy is a paramedic and plays it very safe. He doesn't take risks and isn't impulsive. Erin, on the other hand, does take risks, and this is something Troy can't handle. He doesn't want to be in a relationship with a risk-taker like Erin, and would prefer to find someone a little more settled down. And Erin doesn't want to be with someone who is so safe and by-the-books. But the more time they spend together, the more they realize they can't fight their attraction.

This book is fun, sweet and so romantic. Erin and Troy are lovable characters and I enjoyed reading their story. Ms. Bielman definitely knows how to create a wonderful romance with her words. All of the characters are fun and I love that each character from the previous books are brought back into the stories. I love the setting of small-town Cascade and feel like I can picture everything! Ms. Bielman does such a wonderful job with her writing that I could feel the pain of the characters when certain subjects were brought up. She really has a way with words! I can't wait to read more by this author, and if you are looking for a romance, definitely check out this series! You won't be disappointed.

3122,"I never thought that I would rank any Nelson DeMille book just ""OK"", but here it is.  Evidently this was originally written in 1975 as his first stand- alone novel but it was not published until 2013 after a substantial rewrite.  Previously he had written six novels in the Joe Ryker series (1974-1975), none of which I have ever heard of or seen.  I was originally hooked on Mr. DeMille after reading ""Charm School"" (1989), a brilliant story that has always been one of my favorite books, and I have read most of his other novels since then.  So it was interesting for me to go back 40 years and see what his style and thoughts were as a budding author.

""The Quest"" is simply another story about the search for the Holy Grail, but it could have been about the search for any mythical relic.  The characters are somewhat shallow with minimal backstory supplied about them, leaving you guessing what their true motivations are.  The main female character professes to be religious yet is less than truthful and has affairs with two men whenever convenient for her. One of the male characters is an older war correspondent who has the crap scared out of him in Ethiopia (having come very close to dying at the hands of a psychopath) yet is willing to return to that same country knowing that meeting up with the same psycho is inevitable.  Not many people can wet themselves with fear and yet return to the scene of the crime.  Our main narrator, Frank Purcell, appears to be the first attempt at constructing the imperfect hero (John Corey) that Mr. DeMille portrays in future novels.  Frank is enjoyable but is only truly interested in a few basic needs.

The writing is a bit jumpy and uneven, most likely the result of trying to double the length of the original story (written 40 years ago in a much simpler style) by a rewrite using the advanced skills that he has developed with four decades of practice.  It's similar to comparing Stephen King's writing today with the original efforts he wrote under the pen name of Richard Bachman.  There is some good stuff here and there but it is lacking in cohesiveness.  Buy it and read it if you like, but there are many other Nelson DeMille novels that are far superior.",2,"[-2.206304153403588, -1.3190646440015272, -1.0056529856451406, -1.0346795544384482, -1.1073247599912872]",-1.0056529856451406

She brings this iconic figure to life.  You could very well forget that you are reading a novel rather than an actual autobiography and I appreciated the fact that the story is written directly towards the reader.  It's coming right at you, where you are identified as Reader.  To which each time I thought, oh yes I am here 100 percent!  Of course how else would a performer tell their story?  The author states, there is much information available as to Vinnie's performance life, touring and travels, her wedding to another ""perfect person in miniature"" General Tom Thumb.  Those points did hold interest for me, as I didn't know much about the history ahead of time.  What Melanie Benjamin has done with this creation however, is give us a colorful story to go with the stark facts. Vinnie may have been seen as a curiosity by the world but Benjamin gives her so much more depth than the limits of her size.  You are pulled in and you ""get to know"" this character and those close to her.  It shows her pride, frustrations, aspirations and disappointments.  Vinnie shares secrets with her Reader that nobody in her life is aware of.

2240,"Once upon a time, Richard North Patterson was one of my favorite authors. Early books such as Degree Of Guilt, Eyes Of A Child, The Final Witness and Silent Witness are top notch. Then, he went on a long downward spiral which, for me, only started to reverse itself somewhat with a few of his more recent books. However, Patterson has fallen again with his newest book, Fall From Grace.

I won't take your time by providing a summary of the book, which can be obtained in the Amazon Book Description above, as well as in many of the reader reviews. What I think might be of more value in helping to decide if this is a book you want to read is to provide my opinion of Fall From Grace.

Overall, while the plot concept has some merit (albeit one that is not very different from lots of other books), it's executed in such a way in that the investigation by the main character, Adam Blaine, into the death of his father takes wwwaaayyy too long before anything of real interest or excitement occurs.

289,"I love a good family drama, especially with Brits! Add a hefty dash of British humor and I'm all in.  ""The Past"", by Tessa Hadley, is a thoroughly entertaining and addicting story of a family of middle-aged siblings as they reunite for a three-week summer vacation in their grandparent's old and crumbling country manse. We have frivolous Alice and her ex-boyfriend's son, Kasim, orderly oldest daughter Harriet, solid Fran, the youngest and her two delightfully written children Ivy and Arthur. Then there is brother Roland and his new (third) wife Pilar, and his daughter Molly to round out the house party. At first I found Alice to be irritatingly scattered, but by the end I had an entirely different opinion of her. In fact, my feelings for all of the characters changed as the story unfolded.

I'm the oldest of five and so I  can easily identify with (and enjoy!) all the Sturm und Drang of sibling relationships, which just intensified my enjoyment of this novel. In addition, Hadley's prose is gorgeous; her luscious descriptions of the bucolic setting, and shambling old house, brought me right into the setting.

""The Past"" is the kind of novel that illustrates the importance of novels in our lives. There is real value in reading about a character's inner monologue. Hadley is extremely gifted at writing about what her characters are thinking about. The importance for us is that reading about what others think, and why, helps us to gain insight and understanding of the world and the people in it. In striving to understand our fellow human beings, we gain so much: sympathy, empathy, understanding, even sometimes disdain and revulsion.

Warning: unfortunately this publication does not use quotations marks. However, quotes are indicated with leading dashes...it's still difficult and distracting to read, but it's better than nothing (marginally). Despite that, I highly recommend this enthralling and well-paced tale.",4,"[-2.8898668987485645, -2.037787739423676, -1.4572623868101893, -1.0074505438525507, -1.0357599525957961]",-1.0074505438525507

5474,"It has been about three years since Edward's father died, and now Edward finds himself . . . adrift.  Craig Lancaster has followed up his first novel, 600 Hours of Edward, with Edward Adrift.  Edward isn't quite as fixed in his routines as he used to be.  Even though his father left him a nice trust fund (he's f---ing loaded), he has enjoyed working at the newspaper.  At least he did, until he was let go.  With time on his hands, he makes plans to go visit his former neighbors, who have moved to Boise, and then to Texas to spend Christmas with his mother.  He hits the road--and the adventure begins.

Equipped with his new ""bitchin' iPhone,"" loaded up with all of R.E.M.'s music, he heads west in his dad's Cadillac.  On the way he gets punched in the nose, nearly runs off the road due to texting while driving, and subsequently gets his first traffic ticket.  In Boise, things go poorly, and when he leaves earlier than expected he gets a stowaway--his troubled, teenage friend.  They continue the road trip together, venturing to a Colorado town he remembers visiting with his dad, years ago.

In Edward Adrift, Edward continues with his growth and increasing independence.  He gives up some of his routines, and improves his ability to develop relationships.  In fact, he may finally have found love. . . .  Lancaster's fans who loved 600 Hours will find the same type of humor and quirkiness in Edward Adrift that made them fall in love with Edward.  His perspectives on life, shaped by his OCD and Asperger's autism, might be different from those of neurotypical readers.

I thought the progression of the story is paced appropriately, and the choices made by the author makes sense with how Melissa West develops the characters, but I ultimately wanted more.

As individuals, Grace and Noah are developed well.  I am able to see what motivates them, and they had legitimate issues to overcome to be together.  I, however, would have liked more in terms of their relationship development.  I needed to see more of them together to really buy into them as a couple.  They have such great couple potential, really.  Their interactions in and out of the bedroom are fantastic and show the chemistry of the couple, but at the end of the book, I was still left needing more.

The secondary characters in the novel are great.  I love Crickets Creek and the people in it.  From the surly maid to Lindy and Savannah, they were just great.  Melissa West truly created a town I wish I could visit.  I adore Jonah.  He is a great kid, and his character is used well to develop Noahs characterization, but I wish I would have seen more, more of Jonah with Grace and Noah, separately and as a couple.

As I stated, I really enjoyed the plot of the story.  Everything makes sense with the characters, from the conflict to sequence of events.  However, I was left wanting more.  I needed more details, more events.  I want to see Grace struggle with her conflict with her parents.  I want more details showing how Grace is coming into her own and forging ahead.  I want to see more of Noahs struggle with what happened to his parents.  And, ultimately, I want to see more of Noah and Grace.

The fact that I want more should really speak to how well the story is written and how much I enjoyed the characters.  Melissa West is a very talented writer, and I will certainly pick up more books by her.

When I did get into the story, it moved along pretty well. It tells about an Italian immigrant who comes to America. The best part, to me, was the descriptions of Scilla in Italy. The story describes life there around 1900 and then weaves in the city's earthquake of 1908 when it was reduced to rubble.

The immigrant heroine went through a lot, as I'm sure most immigrants did. Like them, she persevered and had American children and grandchildren. Even great-grandchildren. There's supposedly a secret about a child's kidnapping, but it wasn't enough to make the story exciting.

Hoping for a new beginning, ex-DC cop Cameron Rafferty has returned to Emmitsboro following the death of his partner, and accepted the job of Sheriff. He doesn't expect to see anything more serious than a bar fight, which would probably initiated by his mean step-father. And he definitely didn't expect to find love (with the feisty Clare) or have to deal with murdered runaways, slaughtered cattle, satanic rituals or a murdered step-father.

In my opinion, Roberts has created the perfect story of betrayal, romance and sinister happenings. There were several things that made this story exciting and suspenseful ......like missing corpses; people wearing black robes & animal masks while performing sex fueled rituals; troubled teens; animal sacrifices; and a sense of impending doom. As the story unfolds, you find yourself captivated by all the evil in Emmitsboro and simply want to uncover the secrets long ago buried. Anyone who enjoys Nora Roberts will enjoy ""Divine Evil"".

I liked the main characters of Ben, Moody, and Abraham and admired their integrity and courage during horrible situations in post-Civil War Mississippi. While I was aware lynchings did occur, I didn't realize how widespread they were and that people were killed for the most trivial of offenses. ""Trial"" was very moving and informative and because of the subject matter, sometimes hard to read. However, the violence had to be a part of the book to show the horrors people in the town were facing.

The book was suspenseful and the short chapters keep the story moving. I was shocked right along with Ben when he learned who could be trusted and who couldn't in his old hometown. There was a strange scene at the end of the book when he and Abraham's granddaughter Moody are provoking a reaction out of the town's people that didn't seem to fit and that took away from the book somewhat.

Diana is a fire elemental who works for Mother Nature to keep balance in the supernatural realm. Upon occasion she must hunt in the human realm in order to bring justice. When a young human child has gone missing for the second time, her sources send her to a vampire coven. There she meets Alec, a vampire academic who has learned to day walk. He pretty much forces himself into her investigation and as the case builds she acknowledges that he makes a pretty good side-kick.

I loved the dynamic between Diana and Alec. Although Alec is not your typical alpha hero, I liked the fact that he appreciated the talent and abilities of the woman he came to recognize as his mate. What started out as a struggle for dominance in the relationship was eventually worked out to a place where they knew each others strengths and weaknesses and yielded when necessary.

This is a fast paced story that has so many twists and turns that I never knew what to expect next. Listening to the audiobook I found myself constantly having to rewind due to the wealth of action that was taking place. The narrator was pleasant to listen to although I did struggle a time or two to discern which male character might be talking due to no significant inflection at that point of the reading. It was only a small matter and one I was able to easily overlook.

It has great secondary characters who all bring valuable content, particularly Noah's daughter Sophie; she was a feisty little girl flitting between sweet and innocent to being a little monster and her cheeky and innocent comments lifted the story and made me smile.

386,"Margaret Thatcher had one simple insight which converted Britain from Socialism to Conservatism--people who own their own homes are conservative.  We see this property=conservatism maxim playing itself out today, in 401k's.  The fact that the great bulk of the population is invested and doing well has served to insulate President Clinton from virtually every degenerate or incompetent thing he's done.  As long as the market's cranking, everyone just wants to leave things as they are--no change, please.
What does this have to do with Mr. Biswas?
Well, V.S. Naipaul's novel is profoundly conservative in just this way.  At a time when many in the Third World, & the First & Second for that matter, were demanding that wealth be redistributed and the West pay them reparations for colonialism, he gives us Mr. Biswas a decent hard-working Trinidadian of Indian decent, whose sole motivating dream in life is to own his own home.  His simple virtues and noble aspiration stand in stark contrast to the lazy, the tradition bound, the politically myopic and the morally dubious characters around him.
I'm not sure the story warrants it's enormous length, but it's a pleasant enough diversion and has a salutory message.

2765,"Pretending to Dance is my first Diane Chamberlain book, and it grabbed me right away. In the first chapter, we meet Aidan and Molly, a married couple hoping to adopt through an open adoption. As they meet with a social worker to go through the process, Chamberlain manages to reveal a great deal, including the general characters of the couple and a great deal of tantalizing plot information, including a pretty important line at the end of the chapter: I [Molly] try to imagine telling him [Aidan]: My mother murdered my father. It seems she has not been fully honest with either her husband or the social worker. Aidan has accepted her story that her mother died of breast cancer and that her relatives are cold to her, so as far as he is concerned, she is simply in love with him and free of familial entanglements. Half of that is true.

The rest of the book, which I won't spoil, lives up to the promise of the first chapter. In a story reminiscent of those by Jodi Picoult, we learn a fair amount about multiple sclerosis (which afflicts fourteen-year-old Mollys father), open adoption, and pretend therapy (hence the title). A good portion of the book details the time when Molly is fourteen and coming of age, expanding her set of experiences through boys and more and savoring her extremely close relationship with her father. The events of that year significantly shape the events of present day.

Pretending to Dance is eminently readable, quickly engaging, and definitely emotionally involving. There are bits of nostalgia (in the story of the past) that no doubt tug on many readers memories of their own childhoods, sections of suspense, and portions of sincere emotion. For the most part, the story is well told, well written, and engaging.",3,"[-2.102739659644783, -1.1016070174285086, -1.165215436535244, -1.0107839603137974, -1.1848454962270525]",-1.0107839603137974

Milne (The Red House Mystery)
A.A. Milne is, of course, best remembered for his series of Winnie the Pooh tales.  In addition, he wrote for the famous British humor magazine Punch, was a fine playwright and, though he served in WWI, became an outspoken pacifist.  In the midst of all this, he wrote one of the classic English drawing room mysteries--The Red House Mystery.  The book ends on a note which seems to imply that further adventures will follow, but sadly none did.
The Red House is a British manor, home to Mark Ablett, and gathering place for his fun loving friends.  But the bucolic setting is disrupted when Ablett's long lost brother, black sheep of the family, is murdered and Mark goes missing.  Two guests, Antony Gillingham, a sort of Holmsian jack of all trades, and Bill Beverley, a mildly dense Watson-like sidekick, take it upon themselves to solve the crime.  What follows is a reasonably dated but still amusing ""intuitive"" mystery.  Raymond Chandler apparently went out of his way to attack the story as one of the worst examples of the genre, wholly lacking in genuine criminological methodology and requiring enormous intuitive leaps on the part of the ""detectives"".  Still, take it for what it is and it offers a pleasant enough reading experience.

700,"Years ago, I read in a book that President James Garfield was killed by a disgruntled civil servant. No, that's not really the truth.
In ""Destiny of the Republic"" the author writes an incredible historical account of James Garfield who becomes President only to
have his term shortened by a madman with a pistol and a medical community without a clue.

Millard's book is like reading a mystery/thriller. Garfield, a man who was raised in poverty and rose to be a President of a college by age 26, was a man
who spent his life reading, learning and becoming a brilliant man and an astute politician as well as a Civil War General. Everything he does seems to
work out and his life is painted as a man destined to become President of the United States even if he had his doubts that he could really
be the President of our nation.

Meanwhile, a crazed man, Charles Guiteau is lurking in the shadows. Millard does a brilliant job explaining their lives and how their lives
will cross as Guiteau is convinced he deserves a promininent government position. In the book, the underlying issue in politics was the idea
of a merit system versus a spoils system of putting people into government jobs which had split the Republican Party into two distinct camps. Garfield
refuses to deal with Republicans who believe in a spoils system and Guiteau has his own ideas about Garfield and his destiny.

Does Guiteau kill Garfield? I will let you read the book to find out if he was the real killer. Bad medicine, egotistical doctors, and one of our
great inventors are all involved in dealing with Garfield as he tried to recover from the attempted assassination.

This is the type of history book that people need to read. It is just outstanding and paints a picture of this nation during that time that is vivid, somewhat scary, and reminds us how different we were in so many ways just over a century ago and how politics was as ugly then as it is now.",4,"[-1.3812555150175427, -1.3929741618945362, -1.0385928538790847, -1.011673970333771, -1.098946637594594]",-1.011673970333771

She is a young lady who was on a back packing trip through Europe when she found herself in need of a job. Adriana was not ashamed of being a stripper. She only did it as a means of putting a roof over her head. She had morals and a huge dose of self esteem. Milos is a man born into royalty who recently lost is father and is expected to take the throne shortly. He has been resisting it and has developed a habit of drinking and going to strip clubs. That is where they meet when Milos walks into the club Adriana works at. He is completely taken by her and sees that she is not like the other girls. He decides that if he must fulfill his fathers last wishes and marry, he will find a way to convince Adriana to be his bride. There is definitely chemistry between them. The problem that arises is that Milos is not use to feeling so much for a woman and has a hard time with it. This leads to him leaving Adriana for stretches of time. Can they find a way to make it work? Will he finally admit his feelings for her? At one point Adriana is tired of the way she is being treated and goes home to England for a bit. When Milos comes to terms about how he really feels about her, can he convince her to take him back? This was such a great read.

She introduces her primary and secondary characters with detailed description but without the risk of boxing them in with no room to grow. Clark leads us through the legal mechanics for the preparation and conduct of a Hollywood celebrity murder trial with national media attention. It is real world legal drama coming from one of the best prosecutorsturned writerin the business. The how and why of court filings, preliminary hearings, and jury selection is laid out in enlightening detail. The reader is then treated to an authentic full-blown jury trial backed by Marcia Clarks years of lawyering and trial experience. Clark continues her legal series with the exciting and compatible team of ADA, Rachel Knight, homicide detective, Bailey Keller, and the new addition, Declan Shackner. The three team members compliment each other while covering each others back. Clarks writing magic leads the reader through a maze of legal twists and turns, never letting up on the intrigue and excitement of how the drama might end.

In ""If You Lived Here, I'd Know Your Name"" (281 pages) author Heather Lende brings us everyday stories of what life is like in Haines, Alaska. There is no story line in the book, just observations of what life is like in a place that is reachable only by ferry or by plane (no McDonald's!). Surprise, but even in a close-knit community like that, it turns out that there is trouble in the high school (less than 100 kids in total) with kids being picked on etc. Hende writes the obituaries for the local weekly, and that allows her to get even closer to the people in the community, and it comes across in the book. Her love for Haines is obvious, and affectuous. It makes me want to visit the place myself.

The extreme ideas put forth by Laurel and Travis to help Laurel ""hate"" Sapphire Falls plus the reason she wanted to hate the small town didn't leave me with a lot of sympathy for the couple.

As she settles into her rented cottage, she begins to become acquainted with the colorful residents of Virginia Point Cove, each with his or her own set of eccentricities and foibles. No sooner does she move in than Beth finds herself with a strange new friend, which she at first takes to be a firefly but then realizes its a strange little orb of light that can zip around a great speed and travel through solid windows and walls. The orb leads her to a secluded beach, where she discovers a diary hidden away amongst the rocks of the cliff face. Soon Beth is intent upon finding the girl, a woman now, who hid the book away before she disappeared from town. She will not be able to settle comfortably into her new life until that happens. It seems likely that there will be a sequel, since when Beth and the handsome craftsman living in town team up to solve the mystery together, a deeper relationship seems afoot.

When a series of accidents at the theatre threaten the production and the author starts to say the play should not be put on Libby gets curious.  The disappearance and murder of one of the cast members makes everything much more serious and past history seems to be coming to the fore again.

This is an entertaining, though relatively slow moving mystery with some interesting characters and situations.

The relationships between the characters are well done and I especially liked Libby's own budding romance with Ben.  I liked Libby as a character as well as her cat, Sidney, and I thought Fran was good too.  I found the insight into the lives of the hop pickers in the mid twentieth century of interest as my aunt was also one of the many hop pickers during the nineteen forties.

Bailor has very expensive tastes for his lifestyle. Along with local Chicago agent Andrews the team never seems to get any answers out of Bailor. Bailor routinely leave his company for the day and just disappears. Rookie Rawlings and Harper make a pretty good team despite the large gap in their ages. A very quick reading story, this one had some good intrigue as well. The characters were well developed and were provided with hard hitting dialog. This is the first book I've read by author E. H.

Payton believes she has a dark cloud following and refuses to get close to anyone for fear of losing them.  She knows what it feels like to lose the ones you love and never wants to feel that again.  With only 1 close friend, Chloe, Payton starts having adventures with guys in Vegas.  This is her answer to not losing anyone.  You can not lose what you truly never had.  A night is all she ever gives the guys that she meets there.

Ryder works as a publisher at a big time publishing company.  He has been down on his lucky with finding new talent to introduce to the reading world until he comes across an indie author by the name of Reese Edwards.  Her story about her sexual experiences with men she meets in Vegas has Ryder more than ready to sign this author.

They seem to both have secrets from their past that makes then wary of opening up to love and happiness.

Will Payton and Ryder finally come to the conclusion that they are meant for each other?  What happens when they realize that they have been corresponding to each other but without knowing?  And what will happen when a stalker from Paytons life comes into the picture?

The two schemes are related, and Blade soon finds himself alone and on the run until he meets up with Whistler's daughter Abigail (Biel) and a former vampire named Hannibal (Reynolds).  Together, they will try to stop the vampires once and for all.  But, their plan could also spell the end for Blade because of his mixed heritage.

""Blade: Trinity"", while entertaining, is certainly a step down after Guillermo Del Toro's ""Blade II"".  That movie was stylish and well made.  ""Trinity"" is filled with the choppy editing and loud music that has become popular in movies as of late.  And while Del Toro had established himself as a good director, Goyer is in the director's seat for the first time - and it shows.  Jessica Biel is good as the tough chick who enjoys hunting vampires, and Ryan Reynolds adds humor to the movie with almost everything he says and does.  Wesley Snipes slips easily back into the role of Blade, the vampire hunting bad-ass.  While not as good as ""II"", ""Trinity"" will appeal to fans of the series, or anyone who likes action movies.

What was the first thing that connected me to Ruby McCoy? It was not the setting, as that is during the year 1879. Perhaps it was because she was thrust into a position of executor of her fathers will which she did not want. Or because she and her mother lived together, or that she was fatherless. Ruby has a heart as big as Canada, though the majority of the story takes place in Colorado. Sometimes I find it hard to accept that I really do not have to earn love or forgiveness, but I think that it might be a universal feeling to us humans. Following Ruby on her journey was a treat.

Luca is a pyromaniac and I don't feel it was fully explained how or why that came to be.  I found their relationship to be very intense and although he was always brooding, you could tell that he wanted to help her.  When he finally finds out what happened to her and why shes there, the desire to right the wrong done to her causes him to make a deal that will turn on him.
Allison is very reserved and doesnt trust easily.  After she gives her heart to Luca, a betrayal causes her insecurities and self-doubt to root deeply in her soul.
Part Two brings us to years later when they meet again and the hurt comes back to the surface.  I wanted Luca and Allison to find themselves face to face again.  I was rooting for them to get together, and although they finally do, I wasn't satisfied with the way it happened.  We are made to understand that Luca explains the reason for his departure from the institution all those years ago, but it is never explained to the reader.  I wanted to know what happened and was disappointed that it wasn't shown.
There are misunderstanding adding to drama and characters that want to see them separated.  The secondary characters, like Ollie and Archer added so much interest to the story and I found myself wanting to know much more about them.

I struggled with this one a little bit, and it took me some time to figure out why. The other books in the series are in Boston, and they take place in the underground/Crime setting. This one, for obvious reasons, moves the action to another location, so the switch from Oregon to events in Boston seems a little jarring at times. I understand the reasoning for the way it was written, and overall it does work, but it took me a second to switch from Oregon to Boston as I was reading. It's possible this is just me, but I think the juxtaposition of Boston events and how hard Sloan was working to get away from Boston conflicted a bit for me, if that makes sense.

That said, I really enjoyed the parts that were Sloan and Jude, and I think we can all relate to wanting to make our own lives away from our families and on our own, although most of us don't have reasons that are as compelling as hers.

I liked the evolution not only of the story but of the attachment with Jude and Sloan, and I believed their reactions to the events that took place. Again, I have a book in which to totally discuss the events, I will have to spoil a plot point, so I am going to have to be vague and just say that I believed both of them, and their reactions.

Charley, Amy and Vincent go against Dandridge.  Of course, you know how it has to end.  This film combines comedy with horror to make a fine hybrid.  Roddy McDowell was a great character actor in early days of MGM (best as Liz Taylor's sidekick.)  This was a comeback for McDowell.

1484,"I have to give credit to the author here. Unlike some other books on poverty in America, he does more than give us glurge in the form of one sad sack story after another. He at least acknowledges that the landlord is a human (well, a two humans) and at the start, I thought wed get a two sided tale. In the end though, we just get an empathetic view of the tenants with the owners being shown as hard hearted exploiters on their way to great wealth.

The core of the issue here is that poor people pay such a disproportional share of their income in rent that they have little left for existence.  This also leaves them utterly no reserve (except in one case of SSI) so any surprise leaves them unable to pay the rent and then either eviction or penalties which often lead to an eviction.

In the case of SSI, the disabled person thinks she cant accrue more than $1,000 (its really $2,000 as the author points out) so whenever shes about to go over that savings amount, she goes on a layaway shopping spree. No surprise that people will game any system you put them in.

The author also, at the end of the book, does some analysis rather than just leave us drowning in the glurge. Hes a bit light on solutions other than declaring shelter a right and so anybody with a hand out will get a handout in the form of a voucher for free housing. Why not cut right to the chase and institute a Star Trek Economy where everything is free for everyone?

He says that the liberal analysis that poverty is caused by institutional oppression and conservative analysis that poverty is the result of culture are both wrong but he doesnt say whats right.

Id have preferred a good deal less sad story content, although I have to admit they were well presented, sympathetic and interesting,  and a great deal more thought as to why and what if anything to do. My thought is that we have betrayed many of our fellow citizens by making it almost impossible for them to achieve a decent living. We did it by moving the bar to a decent job so high that many cant jump over it.

 4.5 for me.  After recently reading one of N.D. other novels, I put this on hold at my local library.  I usually don't purchase something that is under 200 pages unless it is on sale or free.  I think this book changed my mind on that.
  Georgia and Weston's story, too sweet, too poignant, too lovely, was a beautiful read.  Georgia, who seems pull-together and successful as a screen-writer of Christmas made-for TV movies, returns home to help with a fundraiser for a little girl who is ill.
  Georgia's past comes crashing into her present, and she has to reconcile her past with her present, and make some decisions to love and trust beyond her Grandmother.
  Georgia's wounds, her hurts, her insecurities, her thoughts as she realizes what her present and future can be, were a lovely story of hope, of caring, of compassion that was interwoven with herself, Weston, Nan, and Willa and Savannah, and of course the other characters in this small town.  Of course it helps that the attraction she and Weston feel for each other was magically described, Georgia fights it, not trusting him, or herself.  She gradually learns to trust her heart, and not let others determine how she faces her future.  Letting go of the reservations, and uncertainties she feels in light of the understanding, love, and hope she feels with him.  The play, the students and their insecurities, Georgia's insecurities, her hopes, her dreams that come alive in this small town were beautifully told.

2172,"Stung is a thrilling, sometimes horrific, yet romantic tale that captivated me from the very beginning. When Fiona Tarsis, the main character, wakes up on her own bed, everything is different. Her home seems to have been in a state of neglect and abandonment for a very long time, the outside world is a desolate wasteland populated by beasts, and she is no longer a thirteen-year-old girl.

This is the kind of start to a book that is bound to grab my attention and hold it until answers to the mystery are found. The author fortunately does not provide the answers right away but keeps the reader guessing throughout the story, only supplying all the pieces of the puzzle towards the end.

Stung presents a new and refreshing take on the futuristic, changed world theme. In this case the world isn't overrun by zombies, but by beasts. I, however, thought the raiders who roam the part of the city outside the wall, to be just as dangerous as the tattoo-marked beasts. Then there is the militia, supposed to be the good, law-keeping guys, whose loyalties are so doubtful that I wondered who the true beasts in this story were. As in all chaotic societies, there are those who will exploit the circumstances for personal gain.

Fiona is a strong, realistic female lead. Dreyden Bowen, as the other main character, is a bit of an enigma in the beginning. Because of some genetic tampering with the natural order of things, siblings are forced to fight to the death, middle aged people are terminated when they get to the age of fifty-five, and families are split because of a simple tattoo.

For those who love a bit of romance in a book, Stung will more than satisfy you. As impossibly difficult and often heart breaking choices and sacrifices need to be made, you may need to keep the Kleenex close at hand.

For a never-a-dull moment read full of suspense and romance, I highly recommend Stung as a more than worthwhile read. (Ellen Fritz)",4,"[-2.843616811085341, -2.2021691948485094, -1.125424329451993, -1.019158239482638, -1.3389089337460183]",-1.019158239482638

While visiting the property with her friend, she is startled by a bearded stranger, Jack, who not only remembers her but has been staying on the property and helping with the upkeep. Returning to her hotel, she receives a call from George Burris, a former reporter from the local newspaper, wanting to meet with her and discuss further details of her grandparents' disappearance.but when she goes to meet him, she is stopped by Jack and before they can enter the house they hear a shot and then find the dead body of George. Does his death have anything to do with the disappearance? As Sarah tries to move forward with the property sale, she finds herself becoming nostalgic, remembering pleasant times on the farm and reconnecting with former childhood friends, one of which was Jack. Will she finally sell the farm and leave Mystic River forever or will Jack convince her to stay and redevelop the farm? When another murder occurs on the farm, this decision could mean life or death for Sarah. This is the first book in a new series and I really enjoyed it.

5663,"How could I explain the sheer intensity of Lisa's narrative? Every chapter is like a musical note that is played in a non-stop fashion. You can't just stop because the characters draw you into their lives like a magnet.

In this novel, first it's the provocative dialogues between this wild ex-SEAL and this kick-ass woman on the fun from an evil danger. The, it's the tug-of-war they engage in because he's mesmerized and she's cautious to trust a stranger, or put him in the line of fire. Gloriously, they reach that powerful moment where that magnetic pull between them is materialized into suggestive words and emotion-filled lust, pledges of honour, and remarkably planned suspense.

The Walker brothers and their security firm are handling a particularly evasive subject which gets more complicated by adding in Sierra's own burden. The two cases collide in a tense, convoluted plot that involves thrilling suspense, calculated surveillance, smart planning, a little over-the-top resolution.

I loved the dynamics among all the characters, men and women, couples and alpha loners, both their unique attitudes and their incredible expertise. As to Sierra and Asher, they make a fine example of struggle for trust, survival, and hard-earned love. Amazing read, once more. I'm surely reading the next novel in this series!

The Billionaires Christmas Proposal is a stand alone read, however both the hero and heroine were introduced in The Billionaires Christmas Baby.

Ethan Dane has been fawning after Allison Barrington for years, in fact, since the day he met her at their best friends wedding. The two come from totally different backgrounds and for that, Allison is always turning Ethan down. But when Allisons apartment burns down, Ethan is the first person she thinks of to help her and her sixteen-year-old sister out.

For Ethan, Allison's apartment fire couldn't come at a better or worst time. He has a secret that makes the beginning of December a little hard for him. Having Allison stay with him could uplift his mood bigtime. Unfortunately, Ethan has something to prove to his family, and in doing so, hell have to rip apart Allisons heart.

What did I like? Without question, the characters. Ethan and Allison are both people I would love to have as friends. The are both caring and compassionate people who truly love those they care about. They also both have secrets they keep from those they are close to. There's also Allisons sixteen-year-old sister, Dani. Dani provides the comic relief to the story and at times provides words of wisdom.

What didn't I like? While I liked the storyline and the ultimate outcome, the story was predictable. I didn't like the way Allison, her sister, and friends reacted to Ethan when they found out his business deal had to do with the shelter she worked at. Without getting his side of things, they immediately attack him, not realizing he was trying to come up with the best possible solution.

However, Miss Quested is overwhelmed by the caves & accuses Aziz of attacking her & for all their good intentions, they are shown to be just as incapable of understanding Indians as the worst of their fellow Brits.
This is certainly the best of Forster's novels.  The clash of cultures makes for interesting reading.  However, after a century of decolonization and independence, it's legitimate to ask whether places like India are better off today, as independent nations, than they were in 1900, as colonies.  Forster  makes the point that the English will never understand the Indians & can never be friends with them, but will Hindus ever understand Moslems & can they ever be friends?  More importantly, even if the English never could befriend the Indians, wasn't their governance, at least, enlightened & constructive?  Whereas, the Hindus who feel actual hatred towards the Moslems (& vice versa) have governed in a backward and destructive manner?  Should ethnicity be the deciding factor in who governs a country or are governing principles (democracy, capitalism, religious tolerance) more important to the welfare of the population?
It seems to me that Forster & his ilk bet on ethnicity & events have shown them to be catastrophically mistaken.

After the unexpected death of her husband, Joanne Huist Smith had no idea how she would keep herself together and be strong for her three children--especially with the holiday season approaching. But 12 days before Christmas, presents begin appearing on her doorstep with notes from their ""True Friends."" As the Smiths came together to solve the mystery of who the gifts were from, they began to thaw out from their grief and come together again as a family. This true story about the power of random acts of kindness will warm the heart, a beautiful reminder of the miracles of Christmas and the gift of family during the holiday season.

About Author:

Joanne Huist Smith is a native of Dayton, OH. She earned a bachelor's degree in English at Wright State University and worked as a reporter for the Dayton Daily News. She is the mother of three and grandmother of two.

My Review:

  Such a precious story that is perfect for the holidays. A family of five loses the father of the family and is instantly grief stricken and understandably so. Christmas seems like a desrt land in the wake of it all. But as a very generous family starts to help the grief stricken family by leaving anonymous gifts on their door step. Before long this gives the family some hope to cling to that gradually gets them through such a devastating time.

 The author has set her memories to page so that she is able to share with everyone the Secret Santa tradition. The world and those around us could really use some cheering up, especially during the holidays. What a great story and how awesome would it be to be able to provide this to a family in need.

1481,"On a dark night in early August 1812, a young village girl heads to Camlet Moat to offer a sacrifice to the woman who lives in the sacred well. While there, she stumbles upon a body - the body of a young woman who has been stabbed. When the authorities arrive, they find that the woman, Gabrielle Tennyson, was helping to excavate the site; Camlet Moat was believed to be the location of Camelot. But who would want to kill Gabrielle? And what happened to her two young cousins, George and Alfred, who were staying with her?

When Bow Street needs help, they turn to amateur detective Sebastian St. Cyr, a member of the aristocracy with the uncanny ability to see in the dark, hear faint sounds, and a knack for sniffing out murderers. Along with his new wife, Hero (the daughter of Lord Jarvis, one of the prince's most trusted aides), his surgeon/coroner friend Paul Gibson, and his tiger, Tom, Sebastian is determined to find not only who killed Gabrielle but what happened to the two young boys she was caring for.

Before he realizes what is happening, Sebastian finds himself in a web involving Arthurian legend, the Napoleonic wars, a publicity stunt to embarrass the prince, a possible forgery, an unsavory scholar with sick tendencies, a family with a dark secret, and a tavern owner who could be his twin - and that's not counting his wife's involvement. For the deeper Sebastian investigates, the more murky the case becomes. Was Gabrielle killed for something she knew or discovered? Or were her young cousins the target?

Like the previous six Sebastian St. Cyr novels, ""When Maidens Mourn"" is a delightful mix of historical mystery and unforgettable characters.

9496,"""Hysteria"" (95 min.) brings the highly unlikely (but we are reminded at the beginning of the film that ""This movie is based on true events. Really."") story of a young doctor Dr. Mortimer Granville (played by Hugh Dancy) in London, 1880, who is struggling but eventually finds a job with Dr. Robert Dalrymple (played brillantly by Jonathan Pryce) who is treating women for the so-called hysteria disease, really a catch-all for any and all things supposedly wrong with women in those days. The treatment is nothing else but to touch these women's private parts until they reach ""paroxysmal convulsions"" (wink, wink). The young doctor along with his buddy eventually come up with a mechanical device, which became the vibrator (still the number one sex toy in the world today, we are reminded at the end of the movie).

But the movie in fact is much more about Granville's romantic interplay with the 2 daughters of Dalrymple, Emily (played by Felicity Jones), who is ""daddy's girl"" and to whom Granville gets engaged, and Charlotte (played by  Maggie Gyllenhaal), the ""rebel"" daughter who has set up a social center to help the poor. I don't want to give away much more from the plot, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Maggie Gyllenhall really shines in this movie. I couldn't help but think how much she reminded me of Diane Keaton in her late 70s performances (think Annie Hall).

This book and Hammett's other Continental Op stories are based on his real life experience working for the Pinkertons. Red Harvest and the Continental Op, along with Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe series are the ""fathers"" of hard-boiled private-eye fiction.

Attempting to outline, let alone explain the plot of this book, is difficult and describing it as convoluted is an understatement. When our hero arrives in Personville, aka Poisonville, for a case, he finds the mining town a cesspool of corruption, embroiled in a life and death struggle with rival gangs, hoodlums, grifters and crooked cops all vying for the top of this squalid, but lucrative heap and their piece of the financial pie.

Our nameless hero insinuates himself into the middle of this mess playing the warring factions against each other with double crosses, misinformation and manipulation. (This storyline of the lone gunman in a corrupt town the precursor/basis for Kurosawa's Yojimbo, Clint Eastwood's A Fistful of Dollars and Bruce Willis' Last Man Standing.)

When Marcus meets his fated female, Anne, his life changes for ever. For a Vampire, that is a long time!

8873,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The opening chapter immediately drew me into the story with a scene describing Micah being tied to a chair and threatened by a low-life drug dealer. Luckily, Micah is resourceful and Im glad he lived to see another day. Yes, he did have problems in the past, he is a recovering alcoholic and made many mistakes, but he tries really hard now to do right by his sister and you can't help but sympathize with him. The writing was fluent and that niggling feeling that something was indeed wrong with Lilah and the house they live in kept growing stronger page by page. All the residents of the house on Caribou Road seem deep under Lilahs control, which was rather unsettling, but there are also a lot of things at play in the house and more secrets than it seems at first sight. To add to all that, Lilah is extremely volatile the last days and shes counting off the days for Cyrus to come home because apparently Cyrus alone has the key to understanding the words in the book. His release falls together with the chapter countdown and Mr. Heskett plays it just right in selling us this suspenseful foreboding feeling that something is going to happen after 21 days. Time is running out for Micah to get his sister out of there. He was not wrong, secrets are revealed, plotlines come together and at the end of the book Micah gets himself, again, in a pretty dire situation, being chased after by all of his enemies and he gets a real adrenaline rush. Well I felt it too as I raced through these last pages and could only hope for the best in what seems an impossible and dangerous situation to get out of. I can only say that it ends with a grand finale with a big bang.

I received a copy of The Bluebonnet Betrayal from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for my honest review.

Description From the Publisher:

Pru's life in England is coming full circle. A Texas transplant, she's married to the love of her life, thriving in the plum gardening position she shares with her long-lost brother, and prepping a Chelsea Flower Show exhibit featuring the beloved bluebonnets of the Texas hill country. Technically, Twyla Woodford, the president of a gardening club in the Lone Star State, is in charge of the London event, but Pru seems to be the one getting her hands dirty. When they finally do meet, Pru senses a kindred spirituntil Twyla turns up dead.

Although Twyla's body was half buried under a wall in their display, Pru remains determined to mount a spectacular show. Twyla would have insisted. So Pru recruits her husband, former Detective Chief Inspector Christopher Pearse, to go undercover and do a bit of unofficial digging into Twyla's final hours. If Pru has anything to say about it, this killer is going to learn the hard way not to mess with Texas.

My Review:

The characters continue to grow with this series.  Each new book brings more depth to Pru and her relationships with the other characters, both old and new.  As always Marty Wingate writes a plot that even thought it moves quickly from scene to scene it is not rushed like the rapids on a river, but rather like a gentle bubbling book that soothes.  Readers will quickly fall in love with the Potting Shed Mysteries.  The series is memorable and fun to read.

3459,"This is an extraordinarily well written mystery thriller about a family's secret. It's hard to believe that this is the author's first novel. The abundant descriptions of the characters and the locale make the reader feel like they are on location. The intricate plot revolves around the courageous efforts of the protagonist Mackenzie to untangle the riddle of her dying husband's last wish.
  That quest brings her to Chestnut Hill and the prestigious old moneyed Monroe mansion, the home of Mac's former mother-in-law. The author carefully and thoughtfully creates a foreboding mood between the mansion's many tunnels, locked doors, and the openly hostile behavior of Cora. The tale is intricate but the reader is never confused. Instead the reader is confident they know the secret: until they're repeatedly found to be wrong.
  The last 25% of the story will have the reader screaming at Mac to get the hell out of there. You need to read it to see if she does. This is a fabulous novel especially for a first time novelist.",4,"[-2.3656860318665136, -1.121244911860809, -1.1062199858194648, -1.0372518255530025, -1.0218679298971414]",-1.0218679298971414

649,"Unger reintroduces familiar characters from The Hollows as they face the unresolved issues of the past and attempt to move forward. Most familiar is ex-detective Jones Cooper and his psychologist wife, Maggie. At loose ends since retirement, Jones hasn't yet made peace with his tangled emotional history with his mother, but he has thrown himself into a new role as the neighborhood go-to guy, recently hired by a woman to locate her husband's ex-wife, the woman unavailable since her son came for a visit with his dad. A simple computer search becomes instead a race against time and a violent man with a hidden agenda. Concurrently, psychic Elise Montgomery is compelled to reveal a troubling presentiment to Jones; the long-unresolved abandonment of a husband and son by a mother still haunts Michael Holt after his father's death, the family home filled with the memories and detritus of years; and an unhappy teenager, Willow Graves, provides the catalyst in a drama that marries the secrets of the past to the threat of the present, two women at grace risk as a heartbreaking truth is about to be revealed.

Unger handles the disparate plot threads with her usual dexterity, although the psychological burdens of some previously-met characters become a bit overwhelming. The Hollows is a reservoir of generational memories, families burdened by past mistakes and a population skewed to an older demographic. Often predictable, ungovernable passions rend the fabric of troubled marriages, sowing the seeds of discontent and, sometimes, violence. I found the psychic touch a bit overwrought, but Unger is solid in her writing, if not always riveting.

In his 20th appearance, narrator Delaware teams up again with longtime friend, police detective Milo Sturgis. Their investigation centers on the Playhouse where Michaela and Dylan studied. Run by wealthy Nora Dowd who never succeeded in an acting career of her own, the Playhouse offers free and freeform classes for young hopefuls with no money. Dylan was a particular teacher's pet, though Nora's real-estate mogul brother claims the relationship was over.

The Dowd family and its employees offer up several suspects as at least one old murder turns up ties to the Playhouse. Secretive rich people and twisted, murky motives provide a fairly compelling read, but the repetitive rehashing between Milo and Alex has long grown old, as has Alex's difficulties with women. And the LA minutiae of description in every one of Alex and Milo's comings and goings - right down to the volume of traffic on various streets - lends way more atmosphere than we need. Ditto for the stereotypical descriptions of air headed, plastic would-be actors. Readable, but fans of Kellerman's writing skills may wish he'd come up with something new.

361,"I received an e-ARC of this novel through NetGalley and Bonnier Publishing, Zaffre.

Whoa, this was a really good book. I've been a Christopher Farnsworth fan since I read The President's Vampire and loved the way he constructed his plot and built his characters. This book goes in a different direction but the plot and the main character both have that classic Farnsworth touch and the talent John Smith has is so well developed it was amazing. John Smith is a psychic; he is a reader of minds trained by the CIA to fully develop his gift. Loner doesn't even begin to describe how isolated he keeps himself.

This story starts off with Smith taking on a job in his profession as a private investigator for hire to take on the really tough jobs for only the richest of clients. Smith specializes in those clients listed in the Forbes 500 to be sure they can afford his services. This time he's hired to recover some computer coding stolen from the client, his intellectual property. Naturally the whole situation goes sideways in a hurry and Smith and his helper have to run for their lives to keep from being killed.

Now you might say that the story in this novel is larger than life and you would be absolutely correct. But what would be the fun of reading something you know would stand the chance of being boring? There are an almost equal number of chapters which take place in the present with Smith and Kelsey Foster trying to stay alive after John is rumbled by that big secret government agency and chapters which tell the John Smith backstory. Sometimes backstory just makes me itchy to move ahead with the current problem, but in this case I can see why we had to find out exactly what John's gift is and how he had used it in the past. And speaking of his talent, I can tell you that you will have better concentration than I do if you can resist stopping every once in a while to think about what ramifications that talent would present if it really did exist. I finally came to the decision that I would rather not know what thoughts are swirling around in somebody's head.

I thoroughly enjoyed this first in a new series by Christopher Farnsworth and look forward to reading the next book due out in 2017.",3,"[-1.7585240605141195, -2.0219869600047056, -1.1391157635279654, -1.023855090949595, -1.493991117616922]",-1.023855090949595
1115,"We tend to view the ancient Greeks and Romans as marble statues, cold, noble, and remote.  Anthony Everitt's biography of Marcus Tullius Cicero brings the world of the late Roman Republic to life in all its excess, wealth, violence, and glory.  The central figure is Cicero himself, who strove to maintain the traditional Roman governmental structure in the face of heavy opposition from both the populares or reformers and the optimates or conservatives. Everitt uses modern terminology to help us understand the issues and personalities and complexities of Cicero's life and times.  I recommend this book to Roman scholars and to general readers who, for example, enjoyed the ""I, Claudius"" miniseries on Masterpiece Theater in the 1970s or Steven Saylor's ""Roma Sub Rosa"" mysteries (which feature Cicero as a major character).",4,"[-3.17614605003085, -1.6940665390173888, -1.1680992046617225, -1.0240345446175587, -1.0973031917395186]",-1.0240345446175587

The letters between Tristan Lawson and Lemon McCoy are funny, sarcastic and sometimes even sweet giving us an idea of their ""friendship.""

After an injury that sends him home he heads straight to Lemon's house, where he is turned away by Apple, Lemon's sister, telling him lies to ""protect her sister."" Lemon never learns about this encounter. A few years go by, Tristan is now the head librarian in their struggling library, Lemon owns her own business and is still living at home. She delivers some papers from her father to Tristan, and the old sparks combust. For one amazing night, all their bickering is pushed aside. But in the morning, it's back. But, something happened that night that can't be swept aside. Lemon is pregnant, she wants the baby and she wants to marry Tristan.

This novel can be read as a stand alone, but characters from previous books are a large part of the story. I found myself wanting to shake Apple for her cruelty to both Tristan and Lemon. Their growing love is sweet and touching, and they find out they can handle just about anything together even with interference and bumps in the road. An enjoyable story with a very satisfying ending.

1668,"Annabelle Granger has been on the run since age 7 when her MIT professor father suddenly uprooted the family from its Boston suburb. He changed their names, gave up his career. It was the first of many moves, many identities.

""It seemed, for my mother and me at least, the more we took on other names the more we gave away of ourselves. Until we became silent, ethereal shadows following in my father's blustery wake.""

No explanation was ever given. Now, age 32, Annabelle is an orphan. She lives a paranoid, self-sufficient existence in Boston, her door festooned with locks, her only friends the UPS man and her dog. Then one day she opens the morning paper to discover she has been found dead.

Meanwhile homicide cop Bobby Dodge catches a particularly horrific murder case. Six mummified bodies of young girls have been found in an underground bunker near a derelict Boston insane asylum. One appears to be Annabelle Granger.

New Hampshire author Gardner's latest thriller (after ""Gone"") starts off with multiple mysterious and/or grisly scenarios. She tantalizes the reader with partial answers that serve to open paths to new mysteries. Connections and baffling intersections abound.

Annabelle's first-person narration dovetails nicely with the third-person view of the investigation. There's the possibility of romance and more than a whiff of danger. There's eerie coincidence and explosive, devastating revelations.

Almost inevitably, after so many nail-biting twists and surprises, the solution is a bit of a let down. But it ends with a satisfying bang and Gardner has herself another riveting bestseller.

Marcus and Hannah are mature enough that they made logical decisions regarding their marriage.  Hannah actually tried to leave and go away when she found that David had signed his brother's name in the parish registry.  She had no place to go but her conscience would not allow her to stay and let the Duke be responsible for her.  The author was able to convince me that she really would have left and wasn't just giving lip service to the things she was saying.  Marcus was willing to make great sacrificies in order to protect the honour of his family.  By having the counterfieting plot woven into the story Ms Linden provided a bridge for these two characters to get to know each other and fall in love.  Very, very cleverly done.

Marcus seems to be a cold, unfeeling member of the English aristocracy.  Hannah seems to be a provincal, plain widow.  It was wonderful to watch this author move these characters toward the outcome we wanted to happen.  I might have liked for Hannah to have been a widow for more that six months.  That short time period bothered me a little.  Wonder why the author didn't give her more time to get over the death of a husband she is portrayed as really loving?

929,"When Christ and His Saints Slept is the first of a trilogy of historical fiction planned by Sharon Kay Penman. The journey through history extends from 1120 to 1154. In 1120 on the fateful voyage of the White Ship Henry I's heir apparent William is drowned with the rest of the passengers. Without a legitimate male heir to the throne Henry I named his daughter Maude to be his successor.  This decision proved to have dire consequences for  England.  Penman deftly describes the resulting times of struggle and turbulence.
Maude's cousin Stephen sized the throne before she was crowned empress thereby plunging England into a period of unrest, war and crime.  Stephen is portrayed as a great warrior, but uncertain king. He is easily swayed by advisors who jockeyed for influence and prestige. He lacked the ruthlessness which was necessary for a leader of those times, because of his reluctance to mete out punishment  called for by medieval standards.
While Maude has the resolution to be empress, she lacks the compassion and flexibility to rule with authority. Maude was unable to see that she had to win support, rather than demand it as a her right as a ruler.  She eventually understands that the struggle is not against Steven, but for her son Henry.
Penman introduces us to an intriguing cast of characters during an intriguing period of history.  Ranulf, a bastard son of Henry I, is a loyal and sensitive supporter of his sister Maude.  Penman involves us in his friendships, loves and battles. Ranulf is a complex character who is strongly loyal, while searching for his place in a dangerous time.
Penman is commended for bringing to life medieval England.  Fans of these times should not miss this book.",4,"[-1.1112932402516542, -1.3401910674632576, -1.1687737962359575, -1.0434642665866252, -1.0248537017830102]",-1.0248537017830102

From the back cover:  Where Legend and History Collide,
One Young Woman Will Fight for the Innocent

Born a barons daughter, Lady Merry Ellison is now an enemy of the throne after her fathers failed assassination attempt upon the king. Bold and uniquely skilled, she is willing to go to any lengths to protect the orphaned children of her former villagea group that becomes known as The Ghosts of Farthingale Forest. Merry finds her charge more difficult as their growing notoriety brings increasing trouble their way.

Timothy Grey, ninth child of the Baron of Greyham, longs to perform some feat so legendary that he will rise from obscurity and earn a title of his own. When the Ghosts of Farthingale Forest are spotted in Wyndeshire, where he serves as assistant to the local earl, he might have found his chance. But when he comes face-to-face with the leader of the thieves, hes forced to reexamine everything hes known.

Dina L. Sleiman has written an exciting book. Dauntless is filled with daring rescues, skilful exploits, deadly death traps and very evil enemies. All Merry is trying to do is keep the orphans feed, clothed and housed. It does take money so Merry steals it from the Prince. This action puts a price on her head. Medieval swords and gallantry that I haven't read in quite a while and it is nice to have it back. Get ready for an exciting suspense ride as Dauntless is a thriller, which simply means that everyones lives are in danger from practically page one.  The lead characters are terrific and you root for them as you live through their various heart-throbbing encounters flipping the pages as fast as you can read.  Ms. Sleiman does  a truly remarkable job in this book while exciting us with this story that everyone will enjoy. I am so looking forward to the next book in this series.

3740,"I loved this fascinating Paranormal romance. It held all the usual aspects of a PN romance, but had that extra combined spark of intrigue and humor that had me in stitches a few times. I fell in love with Emma right away.  She's just an average, everyday girl working an average job in San Francisco.  She's genuine, spunky, sassy and somewhat quirky.  And when she literally run's into Teren Adams, spilling coffee all over him....she apologizes, quickly gives him info. to send his dry cleaning bill to her, and rushes off.  I love it...she has no ulterior motives...she's simply ""real"".  And when he call's her for a date, she's stunned that he wants to hook up with her.  She's modest and doesn't harbor false hope with relationships.

Teren Adams is part vampire.  He's more human than he is vampire.  For now.  His conversion to being completely undead will be happening soon.  His heart beating days are numbered and his human side will completely die.  He can exist on blood as well as human food.  His eyes glow in the dark and he has super hearing, speed and strength but he's warm to the touch.  He loves being in the sun.  And when he accidentally runs into Emma Taylor, she catches his attention.  He's intrigued.

I loved this story.  I love how genuine Emma is and how quickly she accepts exactly what Teren is.  She accepts his vampirism with utter fascination and falls for him in little time.  She's a bit disappointed that he doesn't exhibit MORE vampire traits.  To her, he's too normal!  I absolutely adored Teren...(who wouldn't?).  He's such a gentleman....so caring and so in love with Emma.  He would do anything for her.....just about.

 The plot to this story isn't very complex yet it's completely captivating and consuming - - and I was emotionally invested right from the beginning.

5581,"Maggie Crozat has returned to the bayou of Pelican, Louisiana to help her family run their bed-and-breakfast. The Crozat family plantation makes a beautiful place for guests to stay, but its barely turning a profit, and thats before the family are suspected in the murder of one of their guests! Its up to Maggie to prove to the police chief, who happens to hold a serious grudge against the Crozats, that someone outside her family is guilty of murder.

I really enjoyed this Southern mystery. The book has an interesting mix of characters, both the natives of Pelican and the guests of the bed and breakfast. Most of the characters are unique and some a bit quirky, but still realistic. Only Rufus Durand, the police chief, is a bit over-the-top in the animosity he has against Maggie and her family. The mystery provides plenty of possible suspects and Maggie is a likeable amateur sleuth. She has plenty of chemistry with detective Bo Durant, in spite of the fact that hes Rufus Durands first cousin. As rude and narrow-minded Rufus is, thats how pleasant and kind Bo is and hes a great match for Maggie.

This is a wonderful debut in what is hopefully only the first Cajun Country Mystery.

420,"Brilliant. That's one of the best words I can find to describe Julian Barnes' latest book, The Sense of an Ending, for which he was awarded the Man Booker Prize. This is a book that is fairly straightforward, yet its impact sneaks up on you.

When we first meet Tony Webster he is a high school student; he and his friends want nothing more than to be thought of as smart, witty, and successful with the opposite sex. Into their clique comes Adrian Finn, a new student who actually is smart and witty, and while Tony and his friends envy Adrian a bit, they all vow to remain friends even as they go their separate ways. Their lives proceed in this regard until Adrian's life takes a tragic turn. But many years later, when Tony becomes aware of information regarding this tragedy, and his role in it, he begins to look back at his past while trying to figure out how to make sense of this sudden discovery.

The Sense of an Ending is a book about memory--how it aids and how it fails us, and how our memories of events in our past are shaped by what we want to believe. Reading this book I discovered, much as Tony did, that nothing is quite what it seemed, and acceptance that you cannot change past actions is often hard to come by. Julian Barnes let the story unfold little by little, and it isn't until the end of the book that I was able to put all of the pieces together. This is a very short book but it packs a powerful punch, and it conveys the realities we learn as we age and as we analyze the directions our lives have taken. This is a beautifully written book and easily one of the best I've read this year.",4,"[-1.8293903902403288, -1.2780640970020898, -1.1849292020769242, -1.0270247079558088, -1.0419591897358857]",-1.0270247079558088
712,"The Columbus Affair is an interesting, but somewhat unsatisfying non-Cotton Malone thriller done in the Steve Berry style of adding a few novel twists to the myths and mysteries surrounding actual historical figures and events. In this case, Christopher Columbus, whose origins are vague has been recast as a closet Jew in search of a New Jerusalem in order to hide ancient and long missing Israeli artifacts. The modern day segment involves a disgraced journalist and his estranged daughter, a Jamaican crime boss, and a fanatical rich Jewish megalomaniac intent on recovering the artifacts and willing to take out anyone in his way.

The plot itself is a bit convoluted and devolves into an adventure escapade with clues that only our ""hero"" can decipher. With multiple players each coming at the mystery from their own limited perspective the story drags a bit. Berry attempts a tenuous connection to the Cotton Malone universe with a different Magellan billet stand-in that was largely unnecessary to drive the plot forward. As is typical with these historical treasure hunts, a long line of ""keepers"" has maintained this secret for centuries, but the actions of the last couple of keepers was inscrutable to say the least (relying on someone to make it to hundred is never a good strategy). None of the characters were even minimally endearing and the father-daughter relationship was only annoying.

The most enjoyable aspect is the creative license Berry takes with the mysteries surrounding Christopher Columbus to craft a plausible alternate history.",2,"[-3.6126259327264068, -1.2205641847580546, -1.1370770526103604, -1.0270260509154594, -1.197907499269374]",-1.0270260509154594

The Commander is hoping for the return of all of his enhanced fighting machines and the Gray Brothers continue to allude their captor. This is Matt and Laney's story.

The focus of the series follows the `Gray' brothers as they try to find the code that will unlock the mechanism that will end their lives. With only six weeks on the clock, Matt `Gray' Dean believes he has found the doctor responsible for implanting the `death sentence' that awaits his brothers and himself.  Heading to the small town of Charmed, Idaho Matt stumbles into the path of a serial killer that is somehow connected to his past. When he meets bar owner Laney Jacobs, the attraction is immediate and the sexual heat is volatile.

The relationship between Laney and Matt is both seductive and sensual. Matt holds himself back knowing his enhanced powers may reveal more about himself than he wants anyone to know, but Laney soon discovers that Matt is someone she has known for a very long time.

I uncovered the twist to the storyline early on but it did not deter me from the suspense and mystery surrounding the events in Charmed, Idaho and the connections to the Gray Brothers and the `Commander'.

Old prejudices still lingered in many people from  both the North and the South. New businesses are welcomed.
Leah had lost her mother when she was a young girl and had spent the last six years helping then caring for her father. Now he was gone as well. She was more than eager to accept her cousin's invitation to move to Colorado with them. Leah needed to escape so many painful memories of the past several years.

Eli had served in the Civil War and suffered the physical and emotional scars that so many did.. One of his war ""buddies"" urged him to come to Colorado where a doctor was badly needed in this sparsely populated western town. The timing was perfect..

Even though I probably would have never chosen this book if it hadn't been a daily deal, I usually don't read books taking place in the 1600's, I completely enjoyed it.

It is the story of Slecna Marketa Pichlerova a bathmaid and the bloodletter's daughter.  I didn't even know that there was such a thing as a bathmaid, which is basically a girl who helps others (mostly men, it seems) bathe.  She prepares their water and washes them, providing other *duties*.  But Marketa is not your everyday average bathmaid, she is the daughter of Zigmund Pichler the barber-surgeon.  She is fascinated by the bloodletting and the science of bloodletting.

When Don Julius, the King's mad bastard son is imprisoned in a castle that overlooks her baths, he falls madly in love with Marketa.

I totally fell into the story.  Loved all the characters, from Annabella, the witch healer, to Jakub Horicicky de Tenepec - the rosy chemist born and raised in Cesky Krumlov.

Sometimes reading these types of stories I feel skeptical of how much it was the child, but he pretty clearly shows her personality and her spirit shining through.

I also thought he did an excellent job of maintaining focus and being vulnerable enough to make it real.  I lost my 10 year old to a terminal, untreatable condition and I could relate to a lot of the emotions he had and the things he did to try to save her, and how the timing of her death surprised them.  I could also relate to the issue of miraculous healing and surrendering to the eternal nature of God's promises.  It was very real and in many ways therapeutic for me to read about other people who walked a similar road.

That was just an outstanding series except I did not like the last book as well as the previous ones.  Now on to Elemental World.  I loved Carwyn in the first series but this book just didn't do it for me.  It had a decent story line but I could not connect to some of the characters like I did in the Elemental Mysteries Series.  The good - it was so great the way that Elizabeth Hunter, with her skillful writing, managed to tell the same past story but from a completely different perspective - from Carwyn's perspective - and it did not come off as repetitive. Plus, I loved that previous characters were brought into this one.  Some authors attempt that but it doesn't come off too well.  This was well done.  A decent read but you will definitely want to read the Elemental Mysteries books first to have a good understanding of all the characters and the story line.",2,"[-2.9800079194200624, -1.2849496259925488, -1.0497695421363893, -1.0284842264858678, -1.1523812685019696]",-1.0284842264858678
9747,"The cats only liked the feather toy.  Unfortunately I did not start my cats out with a designated cat scratching toy when they were young.  My older cat is declawed and it had been my intention to have the younger cat declawed as well, but I never got around to it.  Not having had a cat with claws before, I didn't realize the importance of teaching her that she could only scratch on certain places.  So she has been using some of my furniture.

I was hoping this would prove interesting enough that she would adopt it as her new scratching place but so far that doesn't seem to be the case.  My older cat discovered the feather toy within minutes of setting this out on the living room floor.  He loves feather toys and went at it with a gusto.  By the next morning the feather toy was no more so he completely lost interest in this.

I have tried showing my younger cat how it feels on her paws/claws but I have not seen her use it at all.  Both of them would much rather sit on any piece of upholstered furniture than on this and she doesn't feel the need the use it for scratching.

So I would recommend getting this for a new kitten and making it the designated scratching place.  It is small enough that a kitten might find it more interesting than my fully grown cats.  And a kitten might like to hide in the ""tunnel"" under it.  It seems on the small side for a fully grown cat.",2,"[-2.3411137533730244, -1.5571268073023876, -1.0380194155085878, -1.0287082040502051, -1.2770104859754312]",-1.0287082040502051

Lia, discharged for the second time from the clinic, must deal with her life: parents, school, step-sister, and the ghosts that Cassie has left behind. Anderson's poetic, semi-fairy tale prose perfectly and tragically captures Lia's emotional state, a tortured soul trapped in a tortured body. A subject not tackled enough in teen literature, Anderson writes strongly, painfully about eating disorders and cutting, capturing a lost voice trapped in addiction. Anderson provides no easy answers or adult didactic lectures, but just the voice of a tragic, flawed and broken character.

I thoroughly enjoyed it, although some of its books are SUPER good and some just GOOD.  I approached this series cautiously, as I much prefer romance/historical romance to dark paranormal stories.  For me, this book was just okay.  While understanding Mac's motivation and determination to find justice for her sister, she seemed unduly reckless and impulsive much of the time.  I came away with the feeling that blind luck saved her much of the time because she so often showed such poor judgment.  That being said, I will read further into the series to see if I come to like it better and if I come to agree with my sister's high recommendation of the series.  The first book in the Highlander series was just okay for me, but the rest I really enjoyed, so maybe this series will improve also.  I just hope that a romance does develop along the way between Barrons and Mac.  I also hope that the author does not abandon her Highlander series.

While the prologue of eye of the god opens in 1653 India, retracing the folklore of the Hope Diamond, the first chapter transports the reader to contemporary Rio de Janeiro. Alex, a museum curator from the Smithsonian, witnesses the theft of priceless paintings by artists such as Picasso and Monet. During the terrifying robbery, one of the thieves sets his eyes on Alex for the first time, a meeting that comes to haunt them both.

Back at the Smithsonian, Alex is responsible to oversee the showing of the Hope Diamond. Fascination with its bloody history has made it ""...the most viewed museum object in the world, boasting more visitors each year than the Mona Lisa."" (p. 29)

The villainous plans of the thieves carry suspense while the story ventures into past legends. Alternating chapters parallel the past with the present. I found the involvement of King Louis XIV particularly intersting in light of having just read A Prisoner of Versailles by Golden Keyes Parsons.

The storyline is entertaining and grabs your attention from the first chapter. The characters are very well matched, which results in hilarious banter and captivating scenes. I could definitely see the two individual author styles, since I am a fan of both their work, but they blended together smoothly to provide quite a romantic treat.

The first half of this novel focuses on a life changing experience for two strangers. What started out as a necessary escape for Aubrey turns into an exciting road trip she will never forget. With an innocent glance at a Harley motorcycle and a mishap with a Barrack Obama bobblehead, her quick getaway gets a lot more crowded but tons more fun. Chance is the type of guy you can't resist, even if you try, and Aubrey does her best to keep him at a lengthy distance. He's so vibrant and impulsive that I know any time spent with him would be an amazing adventure.

While the car is eating up miles and California is getting closer with each hour, Chance and Aubrey build an indestructible bond. The stops along the way give them extra opportunities to really get to know one another and find hysterical ways to pass the time. I loved all of the cute details and sweet tokens that were special just between them. Detours are meant to be taken and rules are meant to be broken! It's glaringly obvious that Chance has an enormous secret that he's not planning to share. Eventually time runs out and there is so much left unsaid.

I was definitely not expecting that big twist!

The second half of the story is centered on redemption. I won't ruin the anything for you but know it is well worth the slow burn. I appreciated the change in narration and was happy I got to witness the journey through Chance's perspective too. Chance and Aubrey have fantastic chemistry and are clearly compatible but has too much happened? You gotta find out!

The Rain was heavy now and the hem of her dress was splattered with mud. She'd have to hide it afterward; no one could know that she'd been out.""

Thus begins this epic novel of 512 pages by bestselling author Kate Morton. Alice Edevane lives on the family estate in Cornwall, England. A very precocious and talented 16-year-old, she aspires to be an author so carries around a journal so she can record her thoughts. On the eve of Midsummer's Eve, Alice's young brother Theo disappears, never to be found. Was he kidnapped, murdered or did he get lost? No one knows, but there is a lot of speculation. This is a tragedy that all families fear especially families in the Edevane's position, moneyed and titled. Waiting for the ransom that they are sure that will come, but it does not.

Fast forward decades later, Alice lives in London as a successful author. Her brother's case was never solved but a detective Sadie Sparrow who is on an leave pending an investigation regarding a case that she was involved in. Staying with her grandfather in Cornwall, Sadie comes across an old abandoned estate that is in disrepair. It appears that the owners just up and left, everything left as if they still lived there. She finds out that the estate is the home of Alice Edevane when she was a child. At the same time, Sadie is battling her own issues with a case that involved a grandmother, daughter, and her child. Sadie made some decisions that

Through flashbacks, we learn about the Edevane family from Theo to Anthony, the father. Family secrets are uncovered, even though Alice wishes they were not. With Sadie's help the mysteries surrounding Loeanneth, Alice's siblings, Deborah and Clementine and parents, Eleanor and Anthony  and grandmother Constance are eventually brought to light for an enjoyable novel of destinies that are linked.

This articulate essayist has produced a milestone book which addresses the frightening and ever-increasing economic disparity that marks modern-day capitalism. (If Karl Marx had her gift for apt descriptions and gripping journalism, ""Das Kapital"" would be far more widely read!)
She writes, ""The 'working poor', as they are approvingly termed, are in fact the major philanthropists of our society.  They neglect their own children so that the children of others will be cared for; they live in substandard housing so that other homes will be shiny and perfect; they endure privation so that inflation will be low and stocks high.  To be a member of the working poor is to be an anonymous donor, a nameless benefactor, to everyone else.""
  Even the vassal-workers of medieval times may have had better lives and working conditions; there is no buffer, no benefits of ""noblesse oblige"", under world market capitalism.  Ehrenreich hauntingly depicts the day to day struggles of the marginated working poor. Her book is a stunning indictment of  soulless corporations devoted to accumulating wealth while paying their workers subsistence wages.
  ""Nickel and Dimed"" will give new heart to members of the ""old left"": Capitalism may yet crumble from within, falling victim to its own heritage of injustice and greed.  The system is creaking now, and present conditions cannot be sustained.

1724,"When I saw this book was a zombie western romance, I was a little bit wary. I love zombies, but romance isn't my thing and I don't think I've ever read a western in my life. But I'm nothing if not adventurous, so I decided to give it a try, and I'm really glad that I did.

Told in alternating POVs of Red, a beautiful loner with a tragic past, and Trace (also known as Cowboy), who first encounters her in a wild west saloon, Wanted: Dead or Undead tells their story as they move through the country, looking for a safe haven from the zombie hordes. As their relationship moves from unwilling on Red's part, to friendship and finally love, picking up Wen and two children on their travels, Trace gradually discovers more about Red, and the secret she works so hard to hide.

I liked all the characters in this book, all are well drawn and likable, and it's impossible not to cheer for them as they make their way through some pretty hairy situations. And it's a very well written story - Angela Scott has a knack for making her words come alive on the page.

Probably my favourite part of the book, however, is Red and her secret. It's something I've seen only a few times before in zombie books and it's done exceedingly well here - but if you want to know more, you're going to have to read the book!

Although romance is really not big on my list of favourites, the romance between Trace and Red feels very natural and unforced - there's limited cheesiness and some pretty tender moments. I also enjoyed the Wild West setting - as I said earlier it's not something I've read before, but it does bring a whole new facet to zombie killing! Wanted: Dead or Undead is an enjoyable read, with some unique points, and I'll be definitely checking out the next book in the series!",3,"[-1.423254354729154, -2.035181299136215, -1.1014663433146246, -1.0333807504033716, -1.0791974365187433]",-1.0333807504033716
308,"Pete Snow is a social worker for the Division of Family and Youth Services in Tenmile, Montana, a rural area that abuts the Bitterroot mountains and is several hours from Missoula.  He and his wife Beth have recently split up and their daughter, Rachel, is staying with Beth in Missoula.  Their family is in dire straits and Beth takes Rachel with her to live in Texas with a trucker she recently met.  Beth, though not happy with her mother, does not want to speak to Pete.

Pete drinks too much and he knows this.  He has a brother who is wanted by the law for beating up his parole officer and a father who he is virtually estranged from.  Other than Rachel, he is without family.

Pete abhors paperwork and likes to focus on the most difficult cases.  There is Cecil, the boy who runs out of options for foster care.  Even the most generous of homes has kicked him out.  Pete tries to teach him that there is no fairness in life and that he is headed towards a bad outcome in a facility that shows no kindness.  There is also Benjamin Pearl, a near feral child who appears one day in the local school yard.  His father is a disturbed survivalist who punches holes in metal currency and sculpts them in shapes that are bound to evoke strong feelings.  Benjamin and his father are living in a remote camp in the woods and Pete often leaves them vitamins, food, and clothing.

Pete's life is messed up, at least as much as many of his clients.  Each chapter ends with a short clip about Rachel and what is happening in her life.  The reader gets to see things from her perspective.

This is a dark, dark book.  It reaches into the bowels of human darkness and grabs the reader into this space without light.  While beautifully written, it is not a book for everyone.  It is only for those who can tolerate the pain, dysfunction, and horror of what life can bring.",3,"[-2.4133510898830752, -1.3609154727173012, -1.1941321664760267, -1.0334370312315022, -1.0787012641210922]",-1.0334370312315022

James and Byron are best chums with parents who live proper lives in proper communities and attend proper private schools.  What's missing is loving parents, and in fact, James confesses to Byron that he's not even sure his mother wants him.

They both adore Byron's beautiful mother Diana, the trophy wife of a successful businessman, who sets up his family in a beautiful country estate that he comes to visit on weekends.  Diana doesn't share the proper background with the other mums of Byron's school chums but tries hard to fit in.  She only mentions her mother to Byron once when she confesses that she was ""a mistake.""  Byron worked hard to earn his mother's approval and to make her happy without receiving any display of affection in return.  I couldn't help think it paralleled Donna Tartt's book Goldfinch where a boy's privileged life was also gutted by the loss of his mother and the absence of loving caregivers.

When I realized where the paired chapters were heading I wondered if I wanted to keep reading, but I loved Joyce's previous two books and I trusted her.  The selfish ""proper"" people are balanced by the kind and unique friends that Jim meets who help him rise above his circumstances which is all he ever needed.

Unfortunately, the return of a serial killer who is targeting beautiful red-heads (such as Christina), Christina's hidden-until-now predilection to see ghosts and some messing with a Ouija board at her housewarming party opens the door for Christina to become haunted by the cop who was originally accused of the killings and who wants Christina to clear his name.

Jed Braden, former cop turned novel-writer and private investigator, is a distant relation of Christina's.  He's looking into the murders, concerned because one of his books was a fictionalized account that went along with everyone's belief that the cop did it--only the cop was killed and now the murders have started again.  If it's not a copy-cat, Jed wants to help clear the dead cop and his own conscience for adding to the family's pain.  And he's romantically interested in Christina--who with her red hair, is in danger until the killer is caught.

The tale is quite readable and suspenseful.  Graham is an old and sure hand at these things.  I'm not sure this is one of her best, though, since there was sparks but not much of a relationship, otherwise, between Jed and Christina.

4566,"For the second book in this series, the author tells the story of Callum, a rough, young, homeless man that is known for his street art, and Sophie, the estate manager from an extremely wealthy family. The two could not have come from more different worlds, but are drawn to each other. This is a X-rated, opposites attract love story.

Sophie is drawn to Callum because of his tough, savage nature. As a girl that gets off on pain, she craves the danger that Callum emanates. She's playing with fire when she hires him to be her ""security"" during her hotel room trysts with a Dom that she met online. All the while, she's really just trying to raise his interest.

Finally, her antics work. From that point forward, Callum and Sophie are consumed with one another. Their sex life was hot and  definitely dirty.

Meanwhile, their relationship was growing increasingly intimate. What started out as just sex and physical attraction, quickly morphed into something far more emotional in nature. In no time, the two are playing house and all seems perfect.

Of course, just when things seem to be going perfect, something will happen to mess it all up. Sophie's fear of her overbearing, and highly judgmental, family drives a wedge between them. She does something that opens up old wounds for Callum and nearly ruins everything they built together.

Ultimately, things work out the way I wanted. There is a HEA in store for these two. It all works out nicely in the end.

I really enjoyed this dirty tale. It was surprisingly sentimental. Yes, it was definitely dirty, in an ""eating from garbage cans"", gritty sort of way.

Now that he's married to the lovely Donata, I enjoy the books even more because he doesn't have to be so concerned about some of the smaller things in life.  He's worthy of having a few servants, great home cooked meals and a sweet and lovely wife.  He's also deserving of being able to spend time with his daughter with whom he had lost touch with so many years previously and then was able to locate through the help of his erstwhile helpful foe, Mr. Denis.

Yep, things are looking up for Lacey, although I must confess the mystery in this book was a particularly difficult one to read about since it dealt with the Derwent family and some horrendous happenings that touched their lives.  Without giving anything away, one character from past books is murdered, another one beaten and the nice Derwent family undergoes quite a bit of misery.

In the end, Captain Lacey solves the mystery and we get to see a bit of Mr. Denis and his cronies as well as a fair amount of Grenville and Marianne - hopefully that relationship makes some satisfactory progress in future books.  We did have a bit of progress in this one.  I must confess that Grenville is a favorite character and I love reading about him.

I give this book four stars for the writing and the fact the book held my interest, but personally the topic of this book was difficult for me to enjoy.

Nothing about this book is predictable. From the fact that Cat was kidnapped by a vampire when she was sixteen and Mencheres erased her memory when he helped her. Whoa, didn't see that one coming.

Well, from what she remembered later, I was sure that she wouldn't want to be with him.

I liked the idea of seeing the future. Gregor kidnapped Cat to prevent what he saw in his vision. If he didn't see it, he wouldn't kidnap Cat to prevent his death. Kidnapping her just catalysed it all to happen.

I didn't expect Cat to turn into a full vampire at all. So I was surprised when she decided to do it. Even more surprised that her mother was turned as well.

This was a cute friends to lovers story with a twist. The characters meet in college and become best friends. I loved their friendship with one another. Their banter back and forth was effortless and you could really feel the friendship/ love they had for one another. As the years progress they both start to have stronger feelings for one another but both are afraid to admit it for different reasons.

One deal and one night later changes everything for both of these characters and circumstances take them away from one another for an extended period of time. However when they reconnect their friendship will be put to the test and secrets will be revealed.

I liked the realness of this story, it wasn't rushed. It wasn't insta love. They met and formed a true friendship over years and I felt they both knew one another really well. When things transpire and secrets came out later I felt like the characters were able to be adults and handle the situation as such.

There's enough in that mystery to provide a satisfying detective novel, but there's also a romance, a complex family drama, and a paranormal story that brings up interesting points about alternative forms of healing, religious diversity, and different ways of understanding history.

He doesn't want a relationship, or anything similar, as distractions are against his own personal rules. So, to avoid telling her this, and dealing with any potential attempts, he informs his mom he has a girlfriend. Unfortunately, he now has to make his fib a reality and bring her to Christmas dinner. And when the opportunity to ""coerce"" a beautiful tenant in his apartment building arises, he takes it.

It was good as a standalone so don't be afraid to jump in but I will definitely go back and read 1 through 6 because apparently Phillip has his own story which is next and I found him quiet intriguing and mysterious.

Sweet is Rose & Drews story.  Rose, our ballerina comes out the protective, controlling wing of her brother Phillip.  Drew, our sexy attorney is just waiting in the wings for Rose to come to him.  After years of longing his patience pays off.

Not a lot of drama in this story which was alright.  They both knew what they wanted and went after it without miscommunication or lack of trust.  There were a few areas that I would have liked a little more detail  such as Phillips encounter with Drew when he found out he was dating Rose.",3,"[-2.545725022331342, -1.471540498943287, -1.0596802832181216, -1.0465200183227437, -1.0958597234256497]",-1.0465200183227437

1631,"Eve Duncan is a renowned forensic sculptor who can recreate a realistic likeness from a human skull. Her daughter, Bonnie, was murdered by a serial killer 10 years earlier and the body was never recovered. Her good friend from the Atlanta PD, Joe Quinn, is involved in a case where many bodies are unearthed near the Talladega Falls. One of the bodies is from a young girl who might have been Eve's daughter. Joe asks Eve if she would like to reconstruct the head from the skull and she jumps at the chance, because she still wants to bring Bonnie home and put her to rest.
The killer, who calls himself Dom, has become jaded and complacent and no longer feels any lasting thrill or excitement from his kills. He contacts Eve and reveals to her that he has another victim planned and gives her enough clues to track down Jane, a 10-year old girl in a foster home in Atlanta.
Thus begins a cat and mouse game that increases in intensity throughout the book. Eve knows that she is the bait for Dom, and tries desperately to locate Jane before he kills her. Once she has found Jane, Dom lures them to Phoenix where he claims his most recent victim is buried. They team up with a cadaver searching dog and his owner to try to locate the body in hopes that Dom has left some clues that will bring them closer to finding him and ending the spree of killing.
The suspense continues to build until the end of this well-paced thriller, and when the killer is finally exposed it's a shocking revelation. You'll be cheering for Eve and Jane and their newfound friends Monty, the search dog and Sarah, his owner. Joe Quinn and John Logan are competing for Eve's affections throughout the novel, and you can only hope that the best man wins, because she's a prize worth having.",4,"[-2.190915306141092, -1.1604406852743692, -1.0779584376731761, -1.049703217312765, -1.0846800506353722]",-1.049703217312765

But the money is illegal,  so what would happen if it was stolen?  I found the criminals less interesting this time,  but I love the dialogue,  that always rings true for me,  and I love how smart Davenport is,  and how the women in his life still ring circles around him.  I'm glad that Sandford brought back Letty and found something to do with her. The Letty/ Randy/ Juliet side story was very intense. I felt that he didn't quite know what to do with a faithful Lucas so he just kept Weather out of the way.  Indeed she wasn't very present here,  but the routine of Lucas's life felt true.
