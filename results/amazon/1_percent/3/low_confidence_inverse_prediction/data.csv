This book had a lot of excitement, danger and mystery going in it. But at times I seemed lost and had to go back and re read and choose for myself what was happening.  Maybe the Irish thing

I genuinely enjoyed W. Ferraro's newest release! I enjoyed the story between Hunter and Molly.

Hunter Dennsion only had eyes for the beautiful Molly. Waiting for her to become of age he leaves for college. Just when he thinks its time to play his hand and let Molly know his feelings and intentions, he is told ugly lies. Being young and naive, he believes everything he is told and walks away without ever trying to win her affections.

Growing up, Molly had the biggest crush on Hunter Dennison. Never believing she was enough to catch his attention other than to be his buddy, she never realizes his feelings.

Fast forward twenty years, life happens. Molly is now single, divorced and mom of two girls running the popular diner in Clearwater Falls. Hunter is a single dad of a very special little girl and a very sexy doctor.

Friendship sparks into more with these two in very sweet moments. Ferraro is amazing as she guides you through Hunter and Molly's journey of finally finding true love and atonement.

A great addition to Ferraro's Dennison Series! I can not wait what her genius mind will come up with next!",4,"[-1.9227398117096013, -1.2128337805972857, -0.6123826830735986, -1.047104646013292, -0.7368599939037459]",-0.6123826830735986

6356,"Wild Irish is book 3 in the Wild Irish series. Shane Hayes story is full of Feels , full of that sexy Irish action that I have come to love by author CM Seabrook. All of the Wild Irish books can be read as standalones but I do recommend if you read them all, that they are read in order.
Shane and Makena's story brought out the tears, the tissues, the feels. These are two fabulous characters that end up meeting one another and when they meet, instantly click. Their journey on the path to love isn't smooth, is rocky yet they are both what each other need- him a cocky Irishman and she a vulnerable American lass. This story took me on an emotional roller coaster ride with some great characters. I cannot believe this series has come to a close. What a wild and exhilarating ride it was.  CM Seabrook has brought amazing characters to life along with painted vivid , realistic portraits of Ireland and of the scenes in this book. I was able to lose myself in this awesome story because of  the plot, characters and scenes. What a perfect ending to an absolutely wonderful series.

5728,"I have loved every single one of the Heroes for Hire books but this one is my favorite so far. Harrison and Zoe are a match made in heaven, Zoe is ex military and doesn't take anyone's bull, she stands up for herself and knows how to care of herself as well. She's a fighter and very capable but when her father is shot and her mom badly beaten, she ends up being a suspect. There are many many secrets in her family and she went into the military to basically escape but then another incident happened while she was there which led her to leave and start seeking justice on her own. Harrison is called in to look for her after the shooting by her mom's doctor and when he finds her he also finds a feisty woman who he can't resist and she finally drops her guard with him and starts to trust, having her help him in solving the mystery as to who done it and why.
A great great story with action, mystery, some suspense, lust/love and the main reason I really really enjoy these books is because there isn't any extra drama between the couples and this one is no exception and Zoe is my favorite so far of the females, they are all strong women in each of the books but Zoe has endured a lot and still came out stronger.

Kate's father is killed by a group of bandits and she vows to avenge his death. Seeking justice, in the form of revenge, she sets off disguised as a boy. Meeting up with the Colton brothers, she (reluctantly) let's them join her in her quest. However, things are not as straightforward as they seem and the road to vengeance is paved with untamed lands and unsavory characters.

Vengeance Road is fast paced and action packed. Whether there are shootouts or Kate and her gang were running from and chasing down outlaws, I couldn't turn the pages fast enough.

Furthermore, each character was completely unique and well developed. Kate's obsession with retaliation drives her for much, if not all, of the novel. Yet, she is much more than just a bundle of anger. And I loved each of her companions- Jesse and Will, and later Liluye. Their personalities contrast with Kate's unwavering focus on vengeance, creating a dynamic that is both humorous and heartfelt. As for The Rose Riders: their surly, ruthless, criminal ways could not have been depicted better.

Bowman does an excellent job at creating a world and characters that make you feel as if you really are in the West.

That is, she thought she was at the top but her boss calls her in to tell her that ratings for her show on GNN are slipping, a fact that restores her fears from the past and a life she wishes would never appear in memory.  Add to that she knows shes neglecting her daughter Jennie for the job and they are beginning to drift apart.  The first problem will change and the second demands some immediate action but certainly not what Erica envisioned for their family.
Erica is covering the appearance of the candidates, Senator Mike Ortiz and Fred Buchanan, when a bomb rips through the crowd outside the venue for the appearance.  Fred and Judy Buchanan, among numerous others, are instantly killed.  But Erica is not only struck by the horrendous tragedy.  She notices that before Senator Mike Ortiz makes any comment, he seems to look at his wife, Celeste Pierce Ortiz, for approval before continuing.  Worse yet, he seems to smile at inappropriate times and otherwise has no affect regarding the circumstance that is tragic to say the least. As times goes by, including a personal interview with Ortiz, Erica begins to delve further into his background, believing something is very wrong with this man.
This then is the story of Ericas tendency to be in the right place at the right (or wrong depending on ones point of view) time and a powerful intuitive skill in being able to sniff out a potentially explosive story.
Add to that the too perfect image of Celeste Pierce Ortiz and her association with Lily Lau.  But readers will never be able to figure out whats going on behind the scenes that has pathologically dangerous elements that Erica is investigating, actions that will put her own life at risk.
Add to that a choice Erika makes for her daughter will turn out to be very dangerous for Erika and Jenny.  Even the savviest of journalists cant always be sharp about all looming dangers.

Andrew (Ender) Wiggins is one of those selected.  He is singled out early on and ostracized from the rest of the group.  He must learn to defend himself and rely only on himself to win a battle.  That is the true mark of the hero the government needs, the hero they need Ender to become.

As tensions get higher at the Battle School, and Ender becomes a bigger target, he feels more alone and isolated then ever before.  He wonders if he is becoming as cruel as his brother, the one person he hopes never to be like.  The pressure of the Battle School continues to get tougher as the teachers push Ender to his limits.  Will Ender break, or will he become the general that is needed to save Earth?

What an intriguing book.  I typically don't enjoy war room game books, but this one kept me interested.  The strategies involved in the various games were great and the manipulations, though extreme, seemed to fit to hone their soldiers and form them into what was needed to defeat the enemy.  The interplay between Ender and his siblings was interesting as well.  They're all highly gifted individuals and all have different abilities and attitudes towards the world.  I look forward to seeing if those are delved into more deeply in the rest of the quartet.

Some quotes:
""I think we're going to screw him up.""  ""Of course we are.  It's our job.  We're the wicked witch.  We promise gingerbread, but we eat the little bastards alive.""

""...the seed of doubt was there, and it stayed, and every now and then sent out a little root.  It changed everything, to have that seed growing.  It made Ender listen more carefully to what people meant, instead of what they said.  It made him wise.""

""For now that they could not be together, they must be infinitely apart, and what had been sure and unshakeable was now fragile and insubstantial...""

The Escape is the best one of Balogh's Survivor's Club series so far! The MCs are smart, sexy, and likeable. Samantha may be a damsel in distress but she is not weak. Ben is a wounded veteran but not handicapped nor does he become a victim. Beautiful scenery and a good rhythm to the story. This series keeps getting better. For romance fans, especially readers who love historical romance.

7950,"I'll start this off with I really don't like playing Scrabble in the real life board game - I get impatient waiting for folks to hurry up and make a decision, they block me at every turn, etc.

Now that I have that off of my chest, I highly recommend this electronic version of the game, as it is fun, super-addictive, and in a week's worth of ownership I've more than recouped my investment in entertainment value.  I think one of the more helpful features is there is a button to allow the computer to help you which, after all, is only fair because the computer is using the official Scrabble word guide.

The multi-player mode is not too bad - you make your selection / take your turn, then when your turn is complete the Kindle will blank out th eplayer's tiles as you hand the Kindle to your opponent, then they will push a button to reveal their tiles: your opponent can't see your letter tiles unless you let them.

As I said, i think it is super-addictive so let that serve as a warning.

My Review:

The Hook Up kept a gleeful smirk on my face for the duration and provided a fun read filled with clever and saucy humor and an adorable couple.  I have savored each and every book in this cleverly written series and relished their unique and highly amusing meet cute introductions.  Ms. Fenske excels at naughty euphemisms, crisp banter, and salty wit, and I cant seem to get enough of her crafty wordplay.  I giggle-snorted several times during this couples initial meeting, which involved a mistaken identity and confused subject matter.  He believed they were discussing bowling products rather than her adult sales line of personal pleasure enhancing products; so when he used terms such as angle of entry, proper hole drilling, and ball cleaning, well, I may have barked aloud.",1,"[-1.6817662678292549, -0.8957970761455949, -0.6172440351494497, -1.0353751095532373, -0.9307997615521388]",-0.6172440351494497
9355,"This movie proves that some remakes can actually be very good. It's smart, scary, has some dark humor and the zombies are lively and scary. The zombies don't just walk around like dull dead-heads like in Resident Evil for example. Hell this move is everything that Resident Evil could've been.

  Sarah Polly (Go!) plays a women who wakes up one morning with her husband and they both get attacked by the little girl nextdoor who became a zombie. Her husband gets bit and becomes one, so she flees her her house not knowing what is going on. After seeing the madness going on in the streets, she panicks and gets into a car accident. Then she meets a badass cop played by the...badass Vin Rhames (Pulp Fiction). They meet Mekhi Phifer (8-Mile, E.R.) and his pregnant g/f along with Jake Weber (The Cell). At the mall they meet some security guards head by C.J. (Mchael Kelly) who have claimed the mall there's and are relucant to let them stay there.

  The cast is really good but surprisingly Michael  Kelly I think has the best part. . He handles the action scenes just as good as Rhames. Plus since his character has some screws loose and actually enjoys splattering zombie brains all over, it makes his character the most interesting and fun. This movie has some the best action since Aliens dare I say. I thought I've seen enough zombie movies of late but this makes me want to see a sequel get made. The movie is also smart and strange. Is clever how Vin Rhames communicates and becomes friends with a guy on top of a store roof by flashing signs back at each other and then use binoculars to see what each other say. Plus Mikhi Phifer's g/f giving birth has to be one of the strangest and unusual scenes you'll ever see. If anything is disapointing about the movie, it's how it just suddenly ends after so much action, thrills and blood splatter. However is some action during the credits but that  makes you want to see what happens next even more.",0,"[-0.6181231527125396, -1.0864267469583848, -0.6172550254224513, -1.0186014865191246, -1.3129918004617984]",-0.6172550254224513

I read the reviews prior to reading so I did have somewhat of an idea how this was going to go.  I admit I was surprised that even knowing somewhat what I was in store for I was still emotionally caught off guard at how real the words flowed through me.  I really felt for all the character, especially Bailey.  I don't want to go into detail and give any spoilers.

Her step father makes inappropriate advances, and then sells her to some brutal men once her mother has passed away.  These brutal men treat her with kindness, call her beautiful and two of them claim her as theirs.

Steamy, captivating read that will melt your heart and inflame your senses!!

Given to the Berserkers; (5 stars)
This is the first book I read in the series  and I was never confused, and was quickly pulled completely into the story.  The only side-effect is now I feel compelled to read all the previous stories as this was a thoroughly entertaining and high-heat read!!

A competition between and Highland Pack and the Lowland Pack will result in Muriel being claimed by the winning Berserker.  Her sisters have each mated the alphas of these packs creating a mated trio.  The suspense builds as each berserker falls and a victor is closer to being chosen.  .

Muriel has much to learn, as a Berserker is kept in check by having his mate obey  and there are consequences for not doing so.  Suspense, Magic, betrayal and scintillating relationships create an exciting story.

Claimed by the Berserkers; (5 stars)
Fleur is the last of the four sisters who must chose a Berserker mate (or more).  Fleur has been consistently ill, and has had a vision that she will not survive the year, so does not want to select a mate only to then die.  The main Berserkers who are guarding her take matters into their own hands  or paws as Gunnr is stuck in wolf form.
There is a reason Fleur has been ill; and dangerous magic in the area.  Our Berserkers must heal Fleur and entice her to become their mate before the angry pack catches up with them.
Filled with danger, suspense, romance and sensuality; thank heavens Ms. Savino has created an opportunity for many more Berserker stories!!!

As a big fan of Author Nicole Edwards books, I was curious when she wrote a mafia based book.  But I was blown away by it.  She did not disappoint.  The story had plenty of twist and turns along with a beautiful love story of forbidden love.  The type of love that when good and bad are made to chose sides, Love always wins.

Max Adorite was born into the Southern Boys Mafia family.  He has been groomed to take over the family business when his father steps down.  Max has done some things that he knows are not within the law but that is just the way it has to be done.  But nothing had prepared him for Courtney Kogan.  She will throw him off his game in a beautifully brutal way.

Courtney Kogan was born into a family that fights crime and brings down the bad guys.  She has always dreamed of helping other and making the world a better place.  As her father assigns her to a new assignment, her perfect world of hunting the bad guys is about to change.  Max Adorite is going to change the game for her.

As their relationship blooms into friends, they learn to hate and love each other.  They will take each other anyway they can.  But in the end is it enough?  They are from two different worlds.  She is good while he is bad.  Max will do anything to protect Courtney even letting her go.  But can he live without her touch or smile in his life?  And Courtney will she continue to deny that she needs Max as much as she needs to breathe?  Truly in the end is love enough?

I look forward to more in the Southern Boys Mafia series.  The characters were all interesting.  Courtney was a strong heroine that gave Max a run for his money.  But the love that they shared was perfect.",3,"[-1.0458834413326938, -1.5233785249926668, -0.6205554947482879, -1.0042129320023567, -1.0139569987382613]",-0.6205554947482879

3003,"This was a fascinating story that I did not want to put down!  I loved the character of Erin, a follower of God but very attracted to Adam, an unbeliever.  She was strong and sassy and gave Adam a run for his money.  I liked Adam, too, but it was a little frustrating to see some of the choices he made, especially when he was felt he could run his own life better than God could.  Faith and the power of prayer were very important elements in the story and they were done very well.  I liked the discussions Erin and Adam would have about God and I especially liked Erin's struggle to be obedient, no matter the cost.  It was fascinating to learn about the Navajo culture and so sad to read about what many of them endured at the hands of the government, especially taking away their children to go to mission schools.  This fact was what led Erin there in the first place and I loved the sections that focused on the woman Erin's trying to track down.  I like stories with a mix of contemporary and historical elements.  I appreciated a look into a culture I'm not very familiar with and I'm glad to see more stories being published about Native Americans in the Christian market.  I really liked the other characters, too, and felt they added much to the story.  The romance was fun and their banter amusing.

Annabelle is very beautiful but poor and has no dowry and she of course loaths the one man who can give her everything but whats she wants and that is to marry a titled gentleman with a great fortunes. Simone Hunt is not titles but has a great great fortune and he is in love with Annabelle. They have a wirlwind sexy passsionate romance that lead to a beautiful marraige and this is what I like so much about reading Lisa Klepas's books; is she includes the sensual passion through out her entire books and not just on the last page.

5108,"I really enjoyed this book!  The storyline and this concept of a rehab for love addicts and sex addicts is very different and I am totally enjoying it. Kade is gorgeous, rich, sexy and very funny. He is also a sex addict. Vicky is beautiful, sweet and sort of quiet; pretty much the opposite of Kade. She is a love addict. They are also roommates at rehab which I am sure will make for some interesting interactions as it already has. Kade is so funny and the banter between them has drawn me into their story and I am already hooked.
Kade is often a bit cocky for my tastes and a bit too much of a man-whore with is 365 plan, but his sense of humor and apparent sweetness that I see and I know there is more of in him,  is winning me over. I am really hoping he has met his match with Vicky though and that he falls head over heels for her but that he has to really work at it to get her to love him.
I actually feel really bad for Vicky after we find out more details to her story about Bruce, who she is in love with, and why she is in rehab. I am hoping her character comes to a realization and becomes stronger and learns she is worth much more than how she is being treated by Bruce.
I am really looking forward to the next two books and the rest of Kade and Vicky's story!!",3,"[-1.60254996454989, -1.3298731639074322, -0.625912374987691, -1.0064110681502878, -1.2188546801955247]",-0.625912374987691

Diamond grea up around MC Clubs, she knows how the men are, has no desire to get back into the life style. But when Viper offers her the money she needs to save her law firm, she jumps at the opportunity - even if it means having to deal with Knox.

Knox is one of my favorites. I know I said that about Razer and Viper, but Hey! Who said I could only have one favorite??

In Knox's Stand we get a lot of surprises that are related to the entireity of the series. We find there's more, a lot more, than meets the eye with Knox. While in the first 2 books, a lot of the guys pasts were hidden from us, in this one, it's imperative to understanding Knox as a person. We also find some people aren't quite who they seem. We find that even the most unlikely people will offer a helping hand and that even those you don't suspect like a little kink in their lives.

Tom Hanks, Tawny Kitaen (who has to be one of the most GORGEOUS women of all time/no exaggeration!!!), and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.
The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful!

2133,"Shelby Kincaid has suffered the loss of her husband and is left feeling devastated, lonely and forlorn. She is at the stage of her life, where she feels that she is ready to move on and hopes for a brighter future. To improve her life with her two young daughters and herself, she longs to purchase her family's homestead, Misty Willow, the only place that she ever truly belonged. Although the house is at present, abandoned, Shelby has plans to transform it into the perfect home of her memories. This becomes a very big challenge!

AJ Sullivan never wanted Shelby's homestead! He became the owner, only as a punishment!! Yes, a punishment!! His grandfather left it to him because he did not follow the elderly man's wishes!! AJ, not caring about this house, has let it fall into a state of complete disrepair. His greatest wish is to unload this eyesore to this spitfire of a woman. But  even after many angry outbursts from her, he just cannot get her out of his mind.

My Opinions:

Johnnie Alexander is a new author to me, so I really did not know what to expect when I opened this book! I was pleasantly surprised!! It was a fantastic read!

The characters were realistic and so well described that I felt immediately their every challenge, hurt and joy. I easily pictured Shelby in my mind as a spunky young mom who was facing a world of worries and heartaches!! AJ was also suffering from a family past that wasn't full of pleasure. Both of these individuals had disappointments and heartache that make an impact on the reader.

The plot moves along at a steady pace with just enough twists and turns to keep the reader glued to the page. What you expect is not always the outcome!

The setting is described in a way that it portrays a vivid picture of this old home. I really wanted to jump into the story to be there to enjoy this wonderful place.

This book is truly one that keeps you thinking long after you have read the book. Family grudges, unhappy pasts, life's surprises, all influence your life in the present and the future. The past can be overcome but it takes will power and help from above.

I will eagerly be awaiting this author's next book!!

5226,"NORSE JEWEL by Gina Conkle is an exciting Viking/Medieval Historical  Romance set in AD 1022. A quick read with engaging characters and an interesting plot. A Fresh look at the Vikings marauders and their captives. Filled with adventure,betrayal,healing,forgiveness, and the power of love with sweet romance. Join Hakan,a Viking marauder and Norse Chieftain and his Frankish captive(Thrall), Helena, on a journey of love and secrets. Some long secrets finally come to life. What happens when a heathen and a God fearing captive/maid find each other,watch out for the sparks. Very limited sexual conquest,but they do have powerful sensual tension between them,that did not bother me in the least. I thought Hakan a bit to lenient with his captive slave,Helena,considering he was reputed to be a ruthless and cold hearted raider,as compared to other slave owners. Helena basically ruled the roost,sorta of speaking. An overall good read and an author I will follow,for I would love to see what happens next in Hakan and Helena's lives and the lives of the other Norse raiders. Hakan's ,best friend,and second in command betrays him and his family. While I enjoyed this story you are left with many unanswered questions about Hakan's family,his King, and his country. I see another installment coming,or I hope so anyway. I felt the ending was a bit rushed,but an overall great read! Received for an honest review from the publisher.

3187,"What an amazing, psychotic , thrilling, chilling, erotic, dangerous read of a book that you will have. KINGPIN is not a book that has romance with a HEA at this junction, NO, it is not lovey dovey hearts with a hero NO, there is really none of that here. There is blood, and dangerous people with raw, emotional pain that comes thru. Nothing is set in stone. Everything is up in the air, everything is fluid hearts get broken and loyalties are tested to the point of being broken. The only thing you need to know is survival is the key.
Kingpin picks off where it last left off in Cartel and I DO recommend reading Cartel first before reading Kingpin. Part of me had hoped there was a HEA for Mariana and Dornan. As a reader, I know that Mariana loves Dornan because that comes across clearly yet in this book, we get to see this character of John Portland. He is Dornans best friend and he nothing like Doranahe is nothing like him, where Dornan is brutal at times, Portland can be kind and understanding. Mariana is torn and trying to figure out where her heart now lies. Now her heart is torn and she needs to decide what to doshe is a prisoner and yet does she stay or does she take a risk and run with John? The cliffhanger at the end was great and I cannot wait for the next book to answer the shocking end that this book left us hanging on. And OMG what a crazy, sick, and thrilling end to stopI cannot wait  for book 3

Sawyer and Grace have the sweetest relationship and the sweetest children.  Love them!  Even though this is listed as a novella, it was still a great length and told a ""full"" story.  Character development and build up were spot on.  Sex scenes were hot and steamy, as usual.  Glad to see some more great things happen for Grace.  She is the sweetest character out of all of them in the MOH series and deserves it.  Love the hint at the end of the book about Hope.

I still think about it and that is a good sign for me. Meaning I liked it. I do recommend it. Just so you know I really enjoy most of Christy Hayes books. My favorites so far are: #1. Dodge the Bullet- really enjoyed. #2. Shoe Strings- liked it and the characters. #3. Heart of Glass

 In this book we follow Charlotte and Matt. I love these two together and yes I say this about  a lot of books that I love , but I think in this case I was a bit obsessed with these two characters . Charlotte was a wonderful character she was  smart, honest ,relatable ,genuine and passionate about her beliefs . Matt was just as wonderful he was compelling, genuine, smart and let's not forget ridiculously attractive. Literally by the end of this book I wanted to be friendly with Charlotte and Matt was my new book boyfriend lol . The romance between Charlotte and Matt was HOT HOT HOT ! every moment we got to spend with them made me more and more invested in their relationship. Despite anything that happened , no matter what obstacle came up in there way I was rooting for them. Katy Evans did a phenomenal job creating the sexy swoon worthy romance in this book. We get to see Matt and Charlotte on the campaign trail for Matt who is running for president. I will be honest here if Matt was an actually a presidential candidate in the real world I would vote for him and its not  just because he's ridiculously hot, you can see that he loves his country and would do an amazing job as president. I love this story I could gush about this book forever Mr. President was one of the best books I have read this year this book, this story held on to me and did not let go.

 Mr. President was  sexy , addictive story and after reading the end of this book I cannot wait to get my hands on the next book. Katy Evan if you're reading this and you want to give me this book the next book right now that would be wonderful.

1645,"Jackson Steele is back baby, and I couldn't be happier! We were left on a cliffy at the end of book 2, and there is still so much I need to know.

Thankfully, Ms Kenner does not leave us hanging in this final installment of Jackson and Sylvia's story. They were so close but so far from their HEA at the end of On My Knees, I just didn't know how she was going to bring it all together.

But I should not have been worried at all about it, as Under My Skin was amazing. Our lover's story was never, ever going to be an easy journey to a happily ever after, but the twists and turns this final installment took blew me away.

We have suspense, love, laughter, and of course sexy times. Ms Kenner gives good sexy times! But most of all, I loved how through it all, Jackson and Sylvia loved. Love each other, loved their friends, loved family (that deserved their love).

And I adored that we got more of the man that got me into reading J. Kenner books, Damien Stark. There were a couple of parallels between Damien and Jackson's story that I feel tied them and their stories a little closer together.

It is always a sad day when I get to the end of a J. Kenner series - it just makes me very impatient for more.

So Julie, I hope we don't have too long to wait for your next series.

7588,"We live in a three story home with concrete floors -- which is the reason why we continue to survive hurricanes in Southwest Florida.  However the concrete slabs really limit our wifi to just our main floor.  I had tried two different ""range extenders"" with only minimal success, having to struggle to get a strong enough signal to be able to efficiently use my laptop downstairs.

The last time that Comcast came to our home to solve a repetitive problem I convinced the tech to run a second line into the lower level of our home.  That second line would provide service to two TVs and hopefully provide a stronger signal for our wifi on that first floor.  Rather than connect another Comcast router to this new line, I decided (with my usually faulty tech knowledge) to order this Asus router to use instead.  My son took a look at it and told me that it wouldn't work like I wanted it to.  However he proposed that we plug the Asus router into the Comcast router located on the second floor and hopefully get an improvement in our wifi coverage.

It worked!  It provided a much stronger signal for my downstairs laptop, reliable and fast access to the internet, with (so far) no issues as far as drop off or spotty reception.  Now I can expect a good connection anytime I need it while downstairs.  It helped of course that I was already familiar with Asus, having bought my youngest daughter an Asus laptop when she started med school.  That laptop really punched above its weight class!  SoI had no qualms about ordering this router.

Considering that I managed to solve my problem with this unit, even though it wasn't intended to address this issue, shows how far technology has come.  Now if I can only figure out why when I turn on the lights in the hallway that our toilet flushes.

4030,"One thing that Tessa knows how to do, besides write scorching hot scenes, is create a captivating storyline with engaging characters. Staking His Claim is no different. Matt and Lucys story is a bit more carnal and not as emotionally in-depth as the others, in my opinion, but I still loved every minute of it.

I will say that Matt is the darkest of all the men Ive met so far from Tessa, but still, not as dark as other men in romance Ive met. Hes pretty tame, in my opinion. Hes still a pretty stand-up guy, a little closed off and aloof, but fiercely protective and genuine. His history fits with his personality now, but I kind of wished that was explored and resolved a bit more than what was given. It felt a bit too easy for Lucy to break through his hard exterior, especially when hes been closed off for so long. Either way, hes also right up there with the best of them, that dirty-talker! Tessa sure knows how to walk the line of sexy dirty-talking. Yum!

Lucy was a decent female lead and, yet again, although not my favorite Bailey girl, I think she complimented Matt well. I felt like Matt and his problems stole the show and while Lucy had her moments, I didn't get much development and such from her. The romance was great, as always, Tessa delivered a stand-out performance there, but the rest of it was just good. That is probably me being too critical, but its hard for me not to be when the other 4 books in the series has been fantastic from start to finish.

Regardless of my nit-picking, Staking His Claim was still pretty awesome and Queen Tessa did a great job with their story. Oh, and I loved seeing Brent and Hayden throughout the book as well. It always warms my heart to see other characters Ive come to love and see how they're doing. Im so sad to see this series end. Please, Tessa!

Annabelle has just lost her grandmother, the only parental figure she has known, and now has a farm to take care of on her own. She is known as the 'weird' one but her heart and love for all people and animals is not weird. She has such a big kind loving heart and its just what Wyatt needs. She calms him.

Instead of starting his own novel, however, Michael discovers an unpublished manuscript his grandfather left behind and as he reads it, Michael learns secrets about his grandfather and his family.

A beautiful story about love, family and country.  Michael learns his grandfather's history, how he met Michael's grandmother during World War 2 and secrets he never dreamed of.  I love that this is a WW2 story set in America.  Because that war was fought away from mainland America, there are few stories from this perspective.  It was, quite simply, fascinating.

Two hours ago wed never met and less than two hours from now would be the last hes ever see of me.  This was perhaps a shame because he was one hot guy; built with muscles that screamed to be touched, ink that begged to be traced and a face that any woman would kill to kiss.  But I didn't do relationships, not anymore.

By the end of it, I was ready to stab myself in the eyes and cut my ears off; anything not to have to see or hear either of them.

Some people showed their love with gentle and tender moments; Madison and I only knew one speed in everything we did in life.  And doing it together, we fit together perfectly in our imperfect love.

My Review:

I was slow to discover the MC genre, and have to admit, seeing a grouping of Hells Angels barreling down the freeway has yet to provide a thrill - as the ones I generally see in real life tend to have massive beer bellies, deeply textured faces, and appear to have been rode hard and put away wet.  Not at all like the hotties detailed in this book.  But then, Ive never met a Christian Grey type to have offered me an interesting contract in real life either.  This is my first Nina Levine read and I LIKE IT  a lot!  So much so that I plan to make my way through this entire series as this was an excellent start.  Two strong willed and difficult personalities with lots of chemistry, pain and history behind and between them, yet they want to make it work.  So far, there has been a fair amount of steam and a steady diet of plot twists.  I have a downloaded them all and my kindle is fully changed...

1069,"Whenever you have an ongoing series, you always run the risk that it will grow stale. Or even worse, jump the shark.  I'm happy to say that this fourth installment in the Lords of the Underworld series, does neither. In fact, I didn't just like Sabin's story, I loved it.

Sabin, like all the Lords, shares his body with a demon.  His demon is Doubt. And compared to some of the other guys, he got off easy. But Doubt has done its fair share of making Sabin's life difficult. The biggest problem is that Doubt manages to destroy every woman Sabin gets close to. Of course, our heroine is no ordinary woman.

Gwen is a Harpy. She and some other supernatural women were kidnapped by Hunters to become part of a breeding program. The Lords stumble across them one day while fighting Hunters and rescue the women.  Gwen and Sabin have an instant connection.

One of the things I love about this series, besides the uber-hot-sex, is that no two heroes or heroines are alike. Gwen manages to be both vulnerable and strong. I loved watching her grow into her Harpy-abilities as she falls harder and harder for Sabin. Perhaps even more captivating is watching him try to fight his feelings, and failing miserably.

The love story here is both sweet and sexy. And it develops as the ongoing story arc of the Lords' battle with Galen and the Hunters continue. I hope we end up with a book for each Lord. Poor Paris needs a happy ending. 5 stars.",3,"[-1.4530943322083316, -1.7559759244596629, -0.6378269795249569, -1.0165325800320513, -1.0915161856255882]",-0.6378269795249569

A nice, sweet story. I'm sure this book will stay on my keeper shelf along side all Me. Long 's other books.",4,"[-2.9904680151749505, -2.5338858884105346, -0.6391893105052183, -1.0220635519295964, -0.8149763721050055]",-0.6391893105052183
1587,"Avery is on her way home for the Thanksgiving holiday when her plane crashes somewhere in the Rockies. She, one of her fellow swim team members, and three young boys are the only ones who survive. But with winter storms rolling in and few resources on hand, the longer the rescue takes the worse things get.

This is an incredible and emotional read! We know from the outset that Avery survives: her story plays out in alternating chapters, opening with the crash and leading into her waking in the hospital on December 10. The fate of the other survivors is eventually revealed as Avery struggles with the aftermath of the ordeal. And it is a harrowing ordeal!

Avery and Colin, two of the three college teammates who were on the flight from California to Boston (the third we find out pretty immediately is killed in the crash) are surprisingly - but believably - resourceful. Avery's father, an ER doctor, taught her all kinds of basic survival skills useful in the wilderness. But two teenagers against mother nature means they do have very little time if they can survive. And it's not until the end of the book that we find out the whole story about their time out there in the woods.

Meanwhile, Avery is understandably having a hard time transitioning back into regular life. She's closemouthed about what happened after the crash - for multiple reasons - and that's not just with the reporters who are hounding her from the moment she wakes up. Nope, Avery doesn't want to talk about what happened with anyone including her family, her boyfriend, or her teammates.

Kells's portrayal of the teen is truly heart wrenching at times, but the depth of emotion she injects into Avery's character was definitely a big draw for me in the reading. Girl Underwater unfolds quickly with the reader alongside Avery every step of her horrific adventure.

This is Claire Kells's debut release, and it's a solid favorite of mine for 2015! (Which means I'll have my eye out for more from Kells down the line as well.)",3,"[-2.1032948479872338, -1.6810348340955024, -0.6392454586962066, -1.0198822289972889, -1.2149880098075827]",-0.6392454586962066

5 stars
M/F Romance
Triggers: Alcoholism
I was given this book for an honest review by Wicked Reads.

Brad is your typical good old boy.  He has lived his whole life in a small community and even took over his dad's branch of work.  He is sweet and gentle with all of the people he comes in contact with and his empathy is beyond for those he loves.

Hannah is a workaholic.  She loves what she does, but knows that it also takes a toll on her personal life.  She has made some great friends and has come to love her community.  Despite her past, which continues to create anxiety for her, she has found a way to love her life and live it.

Brad has always found Hannah attractive, but thought that she was seeing someone.  When they bump in to each other again, he knows that he has to take his chance.  I loved watching these two figure out themselves in the beginning and then grow together once they were a couple.  It was great to see how Brad was able to ground Hannah and how Hannah was able to be an ear for Brad.

These two had a beautiful dynamic and despite having some reservations about Hannah's maturity, she seemed a little young, I really enjoyed these characters.  I can't wait to see who is getting book #2!",3,"[-1.190629638920747, -2.172710650411029, -0.6407080938377194, -1.0054083647984404, -1.4003002188535645]",-0.6407080938377194

1780,"After reading the blurb for this book, I expected this book to be more emotional - and frankly, depressing - than it ended up being. There were definitely some sad, sentimental moments, but the overall climate of the book was sweet and uplifting. I found this to be a great, heartwarming, second-chance romance.

The story centers on Alexa Sullivan Tate, who tragically loses her husband at a young age. When she is reunited with her first love at her older sister's class reunion, she is again reminded of the love that they shared...and how he walked away from her all those years ago.

Jace McAllister has spent years yearning for Alexa. He regrets the way things ended all of those years ago and has never been able to find anyone that came close to measuring up to his first, and only, love. When he heard that she had married another man he was crushed, but he was glad to know that she had found happiness, even if it was with another man.

When these two are reunited ten years later, their lives have been changed irrevocably. Despite all the time and distance between them, their feelings remain strong. They begin to rebuild a relationship, but with Jace's dangerous job, Alexa fears losing another man that she loves.

Overall, this was a fantastic story. I loved the way that Jace was so open-minded and accepting of Alexa's past. This was a beautiful, touching story. Despite being predictable, I enjoyed every minute. I listened to the Audible version, and the narration was great also.

6055,"As much as I liked Bittersweet, the first book of this series, I was completely taken aback by the rawness and the beauty that is Steadfast.

When we first met Jude in Bittersweet we knew a bit of his background, what we we never imagined was  the extent of the emotions he was holding back, the regret, the loss he suffered. Sarina wrote a character that in the eyes of most is a complete screwed up, a man who paid a high price for a crime he committed while under the influence of drugs. The absolute honesty in which the author approached his disease and his fight to stay clean is one of the things that impressed me the most about this story. It felt so real, so painful, I felt like I was there fighting with Jude every second of every day.

His desire for the drugs that destroyed his life was there, but he wanted to show himself and the world that he was a fighter, that he was going to make it through the hurdle without feeding his body with the poison that had brought so much torment into his life.

Enter Sophie, Jude's ex, who haven't spoken to him in a few years. There's a world of hurt between them, but the love they have for each other is pure, intense, everlasting.

Little by little we see Jude start to walk on the right path, and despite a set back, he's a fighter, he shows the world how strong he really is body and soul. And through it all Sophie is there, encouraging him to be a better man not only for himself but also for her and their future. Aside from having the Shipley family helping Jude, there are also other characters that add such depth to this story.

This is truly one of the most beautiful books I've read this year, from the storyline to the well crafted characters, Sarina Bowen takes the reader on a heartfelt journey of loss, real struggles to survive the horrible disease that is addiction, forgiveness, and hope.

6264,"WOW!!!!  Thats truly the only word that comes to mind after reading Exp1re by Erin Noelle.

I didn't know what to expect going into this book, but what Erin gave us is out of this world!!!  This is an unique and captivating story.  It sent chills down my back throughout most of the story.  For many different reasons, but I cant explain any of them.  I don't want to spoil this book for any readers.

This story was unlike anything I have read before.  The storyline was gripping and held my attention all the way through.  This book is NOT a standalone novel.  It is the first book in this duet and does have a cliffhanger ending.  So if you aren't a fan of cliffhangers I would wait for the second book to come out.  Because goodness knows I am dying for the second book.  I cant wait to see where she takes this story and these characters.  But trust me you WILL want to read this duet!!

I truly could ramble on and on about how great this book is, but I am afraid I am going to slip something and ruin the book.  So this review is going to be on the short side.  Just know this, this book will take you by surprise when you read it.no one can predict what will happen.

As I said the storyline is phenomenal, but so were the characters we got to meet in this book.  This story really focuses on Lyra and Tavian.  There are some other people in this story but they are truly in the background.  I will say that this book touched on one of my hard limits in books, but because the story and characters were so great I was able to overlook it and it didn't diminish my enjoyment of the book.

I truly don't think I have the correct words to do this book justicejust READ THIS BOOK!!!  you won't be sorry.",4,"[-1.4835469445033618, -1.500125530454755, -0.6439324709356533, -1.0161945510668156, -0.7115102880503681]",-0.6439324709356533

She was stricken as an eighteen month old baby with Bell's palsy and never recovered from it. She grew up having to get used to ""the look"" that people would give her (and continue to give her today) because of the paralysis of her face. She has also has been through other very serious medical issues, but she always came through it all with determination and faith in God. I love how after one particularly frightening medical incident, she shares how Romans 8:31 - ""If God be for us, who can be against us"" became her adopted verse.

She shares how she came to start ""Nancy's Notions"", her TV series, ""Sewing With Nancy"", and all the many difficulties along the way. She also shares her family life with us and we feel like she's a dear friend by the end of the book.

I especially enjoyed the little boxes throughout the book where friend and family share their own thoughts about Nancy. This gives you a glimpse into how they see her and how really special she is to them.

This book is so inspiring and also so enjoyable to read. I found it hard to put down and just found myself really admiring someone that I have watched on TV, sewing wonderful projects, so many times. She's just a very strong, yet sweet, woman that you'll really love getting to know better! I highly recommend you getting this book!!

227,"Liesl & Po is an adorable, magical ghost story perfect for reading with your kids at bedtime or to read aloud to your upper elementary/middle grade students. It's got a fairy tale-like quality to it, which I absolutely loved. It's lyrical in the way that it's written, as if the author is taking you by the hand and leading you into a dark forest -- and you're happy to go, even though there are evil stepmothers who lock little girls in the attic and mean alchemists who force their apprentices to sleep in the cold muck with the sheep. Even though there is no sunshine and only potatoes to eat. Even though there's a hideous woman who wraps herself in furs who will not stop until she has what she wants.

But there is good in this dark, sunless world. A guard who only wants to give a scraggly boy a hat so he won't be cold. A girl who draws pictures that call to ghosts. A ghost and its pet who help out girls trapped in attics.

Absolutely wonderful characters! I loved Liesl, Po and its companion, Will, the friendly guard, and even the ""evil"" characters.

In true Marie Skye fashion, she writes a story that will pull on your heart strings and keep you praying that it never ends. This author is so incredibility talented and I always look forward to reading her stories. This one is no different, the characters were very relatable and make you feel a wide range of emotions. I would definitely read the other books in the series first before starting this book, just because it will give a great background and show how much this couple has actually been through. Another amazing 5 star read!

Gavin and Savannah, Filthy and Sweet, have a super hot, steamy, romantic story. Gavin is a writer who moves to Outer Banks to get away from his dark past, and Savannah is the sweet, reserved, girl-next-door, but that all ends when Gavin enters her world. The chemistry between them is so explosive, that it's just awesome. Gavin finds himself climbing out of the dark hole which is his past, Savannah comes out of her shell and they fall in love. Everything seems too good to be true when they come across a tough test to their relationship. Obviously, I don't want to spoil it, but the I loved the story.

I am not a scientist, and when a friend tells me so and so is a great doctor, I translate that to myself to mean my friend likes his/her doctor.  How do we judge?  Clearly, 50% of all doctors graduated in the bottom half of their medical schools.  Not that that, in and of itself is a necessary determinant of whether or not someone is a good physician.  But what is?
Dr. Gawande uses many anecdotes to show how the nascent science of improving performance amongst medical professionals is the key to longer, healthier lives.
Gawande asks hard questions of his profession, as well as of himself: if he's an average surgeon, should he be trusted with someone's life, or their child's life?  Shouldn't we have a right to know how our doctors rate, when there are objective standards that can be applied to performance?
Fairview Children's Hospital in Missouri treats patients with Cystic Fibrosis.  The patients who are seen at that hospital, consistently outlive patients seen at other hospitals who have the same condition.
Gawande argues that data, such as that, should be readily available both to patients and their families, so they can make informed choices about their care, but also for doctors so they can improve their own performance.

For Baylor Moore it was the moment her mother abandoned her and her father, for Jayden Sinclair was the moment he found out his father was not who they all thought he was.

Baylor is  kind of awkward, she's afraid to give her heart to someone, but she's one hell of a fighter and an exceptional hockey player. She's been trying to prove herself all her life to people around her, not only because she's a woman in a man's world and her father is her trainer, but because he's also respected coach in the college circuit.

Jayden has been going through some hard personal times. His father left his mother to fend for herself, and although his older brother and NHL player, Jude, is helping, it's Jayden who's in the home front taking care of things.

Baylor and Jayden meet while on vacation in Florida but things didn't go too well for them, but when things are meant to be nothing will stop them. As luck will have it Baylor's dad is assigned as the new head coach for the Bellevue Bullies and that's when things start getting interesting and Baylor and Jayden reunite. They have the same goals in life, Jayden wants to prove he's as good as his older brother and he can get in the NHL through his own merits, for Baylor is to show the world that the hockey world is ready for a female to be playing with the big boys.

I absolutely LOVED this book, these two fantastic characters along bring this beautiful story to life and  keep the reader glued to their journies until the last word has been written.

And did I mention that Mrs Aleo is the queen of sexual tension? Yeah, she's pretty damn good at that and it's one of the things that keeps me coming back to her books.

I've never been disappointed by one, and the only one I ever had give out on me was the first Series III ... after more than 10 years of service. Even then it would have probably been a simple repair (it stopped feeding paper) but by then I was ready to move up to a better DPI model.

I've had another HP Color Laserjet for about 8 or 9 years now, and it's still going strong. I took this newer model simply for the more advanced features: wireless connection, support for mobile devices, and scanning/copying that I've previously only had on ink-jets.

This M277 was easy to set up (as are virtually all printers these days) and delivers beautiful quality printing. Be warned that replacing toner cartridges for color laser printers is not cheap. However, I only print color on occasion, so for me there is quite a bit of time before having to bite off those cartridge costs.

Who will Heavenly choose? Gosh, that is such a tough decision to make. These three authors did an amazing job with this book and I am very excited to get more on this trio.

This is a good card for that someone you are just not sure what kind of card to get them.
Not a card for a dear friend or family member but more for maybe office or casual person in your life that you still want to say Happy Birthday to just to let them know you are thinking of them.
Could even be a card for a piano teacher for your child or someone like that.
If you do mail it will require extra postage.
The colors are a little more muted to me in real life than what I saw online. Thought it would be very bright but is more subtle.
We like all the white blank space that is in it so we were able to write up a special note to my child's piano teacher.

Ive read other books by this author so I have come to expect the way he manages to write with the true emotion of the scene and produce dialogue as if it were transcribed from recordings of private conversations. Hes a wonderful storyteller and this touching tale of two brothers has an authentic feel to it, as I have four brothers and recognize the tension, love, competiveness and understanding that occurs between them (or often doesnt). The other thing I like about Fischers work is that he always creates a cast of characters that are unique and yet its as if I know them, recognize them from real life. This is a truly enjoyable book.

2271,"Go Away Home is a story that takes the reader back to just before, during and at the very end of World War II in the American Midwest. Liddie Treadwell is a young girl at the beginning of the story and has dreams to leave the farm she lives on with her parents and sister Amelia. She just may be able to get away and move to a close town to apprentice with a seamstress. Her parents of course want her to settle down, marry and have children, which she does want someday but not for awhile. She is growing up in a time of the suffragette and with the help of her spinster aunt, they convince Liddie's parents to let her go and do the apprenticeship. In an unforseen tragedy in the Treadwell household, Liddie's father dies as a result of an accident on the farm. Liddie sees her dreams go out the window because she knows she will be needed at home on the farm.

Liddie's mother does eventually relent and Liddie is off to her apprenticeship. She learns a lot about making clothes and loves what she is doing until she meets a young man, Thomas Littman, who is a photographer. Liddie finds a passion she never knew she had and when Thomas proposes marriage to her she says yes and is eager to go to Paris to live with Thomas. There had been a young man, Joe, who had lived with the Treadwell's for most of his life and helped out on the farm and became one of the family. Joe decides to move to Canada and take up farming on his own. Liddie keeps up a relationship with Joe by letters over a period of years. Joe comes home for a visit and Liddie is forced to rethink what she really wants out of life.

This is a story that will grab at your heartstrings, through tragedy and loss comes love and hopes for the future. Heartbreak for her and her family seem to break the family but ultimately in the end Liddie realizes that what she most wanted to do when a young girl is not what she wants in her heart. Come Away Home is written abut the daily struggles within a family during a tough time in our American history. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I am not sure if there is to be a sequel, but I think it would be interesting to see what happens to Liddie in the future. I highly recommend this book!

But as fate would have it, Lily's past follows stirring up more trouble and then Gavin's past steps up, testing just how strong the bond is between Lily and Gavin.

It's hard to write this review and not giveaway vital pieces of information that must be discovered by the reader as they get to it.  But if you read WHEN FATES COLLIDE, than you know Isabelle Richards is about to take you on one hell of a ride.  I

Gavin and Lily are truly a great couple.  When things are going right for them, they're fun, sexy, and can burning up the pages.  But they spend too much time fighting each other.  Gavin is over-protective with Lily, so she ends up sneaking behind Gavin's back because she knows he'd flip.  In the end, Gavin flips anyway and they have to do the whole fight, apologize and make up thing.  But we expect this, because Lily was the loose cannon.  But in WHEN FATE ISN'T ENOUGH, Gavin also becomes a bit of a loose cannon.  He's moody, hiding things and spend more time trying to make it up to Lily.  He explains why and I could understand his temporary mood swings.  But there can only be one loose cannon in this series and I think Lily firmly owns that.

I'm on pins and needles waiting for the next book.  Fate can't be as cruel as it appears to be, so I'll put my faith in Isabelle Richards that there will be a happily ever after.

6218,"Wow.....
This book had me on the edge of my seat from the very start. I was consumed by this story and these characters long after I was finished! Ms. Laine expertly weaved a unique tale that was suspenseful, mysterious and at some points horrifying, yet also sweet, hopeful and heartwarming. Each facet of this story was cleverly unfolded in past and present sequence to keep you guessing on what was either in store or what had happened in the past. Tade and Reagan are a perfect match, giving each other what they need to be whole. They struggle to find their place in a world that took away many of their choices. Their secrets are their own, or so they thought, and could destroy them both.
This story took me on a roller coaster of emotions that were raw, yet hopeful, horrifying yet sweet. It also had intriguing secondary characters and several surprising plot twists, that make this an unforgettable journey.

8484,"Time travel romance is not my usual book genre.  However, since historical Scottish romance is, I took a chance on Ms. Greysons Highland Hearts series and have been pleasantly surprised.  In fact, after reading the first book, My Highland Lover, I have been hoping to come across more.  The second book, My Highland Bride, did not disappoint.  In fact, it was even better than the first.  The writing style, likeable characters, and plot seemed to flow effortlessly and were engaging.  I especially liked the grandmothers direct, sharp wit, and take charge attitude.  Kept picturing her role being played by the same actress that stars as Violet Crawley, the grandmother, in Downton Abbey.

Fans of Kristen Ashleys  Fantasyland series will likely enjoy this one as it has strong, spirited heroines and possessively protective alpha male heroes.  Heres to hoping Ronan gets his HEA in book #3.  Fortunately, each book is a stand-alone, but I definitely suggest you read them in order to experience the full effect of the series.

Some much joy and sadness!
My joy:
As will all of the Dare to Love series, this edition takes right into the story, like you are actually a part of it. Carly Phillips storytelling is Romantic, Funny, Emotional and Sexy as hell.
Tyler, like all the Dare siblings, has a few residual emotions scars due to Daddy's betrayal of the entire family. Tyler sees things as a teenager and well as an adult that would scar anyone. He is closed off, cautious, emotionally distant and feel he makes all the wrong decisions. All legitimate feelings.
Ella is alone. Has been alone since her mother die of a stroke when she was very young. Having a father that emotional checked out on her, she practically raises herself and learns to depend on no one. One one person has been there for her Avery and her brother, whom she has loved forever, contributes to her insecurities, albeit unwittingly.  When Tyler is asked to go rescue Ella, they finally have a chance to clear the air.
Tyler and Ella are now one of my Favorite H/h in this series.
My Sadness:
That this is the last book in the series. And while I understand the need for new things for an Author to be able to grow at their craft, just know if you ever write the illegitimate Dare Sisters stories, I will be the first to Pre-Order.

725,"For a sweet falling-in-love, following-your-dreams story, this first book in the ""Seven Brides for Seven Bachelors"" series captures it all. While one section of the plot conveys some intrigue and suspense (on a hiking trip in the mountains), most of The Memory Jar is gently paced, often detouring into the past and focusing on internal struggles. And yet Goyer writes in an engaging way with some meaningful lines. So even though this isn't an exciting, edge-of-your-seat book, I was impressed by the sweetness that snuck up on me and the themes that resonated with me.

Sarah Shelter learned a lot from her friendship with Patty - another free-spirited Amish girl - and Patty's sudden death deeply affected Sarah. But when Jathan finally catches her attention by his heroic and gentlemanly actions, his friendship helps Sarah come to terms with her past. She examines her memories, cherishing the ways that Patty blessed her life, and finds the courage to look toward the future - a future that might just have a lot to do with a certain Amish bachelor and their shared dreams (and cupcakes!).

There are quite a few inspiring quotes in this story that stood out to me, and I loved the emphasis on following God's will for one's life and not giving up on the unique passions and purposes He gives each person. The Memory Jar seems to be one of those stories that one reader (like me) will really enjoy, and another reader will find to be ""OK."" Depending on where you are in life and what you're in the mood for, this book may or may not charm you. But if you like a well-written story with open-hearted Amish characters and some really sweet romance, I think you'll agree that The Memory Jar is a great start to Goyer's new series.

The author describes the battle by listing a time, location and often an individual and then explains what happened at that location in defense of Fire Base Illingworth. The book is based on the recollections of individual soldiers as well as the overall history of the event.

In most cases Individual soldiers only know what is going on in the battle that is immediately around them (as opposed to soldiers in a command position or observer position).  The book does a great job at letting you see the event though a soldiers eyes and then placing the event in the context of the battle.

The book then looks at the battle in the context of the Vietnam War as a whole. It tells what happened to the soldiers mentioned in the book. It includes a glossary of terms.

9301,"""Catch me if you can"" is, maybe, Spielberg's first movie not featuring any special effects since Duel. That's good, because the viewer can concentrate in the actors' performance. And that's this movie's main feature.
The story, as everyone may already know, is about Frank W. Abagnale Jr., who left home as a sixteen-year-old and became one of the most successful criminal of all times. What is most interesting, Abagnale was an intelligent felon, his crimes were related to fraudulent checks, identities, etc; he didn't have to murder or kidnapp anyone to be part of FBI's top 10 wanted list.
Abagnale Jr is played by Leonardo diCaprio, acting in a very loose and comfortable way, at times serious, at other times charming, according to the script. Tom Hanks proves his capacity at playing another different character: Carl Hanratty is boring, fatty, charmless, lonely and yet you like him anyway. The duo's relationship is very well portraied in screen. Another good thing is that Christopher Walken's back to a good role as Leonardo diCaprio's father.
This is nice entertainment, and the best part is that it was reportedly an easy and fast film to make, and based on a true story. There are some obvious fictious parts in the movie, but that's for script's sake, so it doesn't ruin the story.

Positives:
+ Light but has good torque. Lightness is so important as I can barely hold up a heavy Dewalt drill if I am working on something half way up a ladder and I am afraid of dropping it. A heavy drill can sometimes also go too far and damage the walls.
+ 3 Position handle - Can be straightened like a screw driver or the handle moved down to take a drill shape. There is a locking button on the side that allows the handle to move up or down
+ Rotary dial allows use as a manual screwdriver vs. power screwdriver.
+ Lithium battery, holds charge for a long time. Comes with a charging cord that is pretty small and does not need a base or take up counter space.
+ Has the button to drive in or out. Also, easy drop in and pull out mechanism for drill bits. Only hexagonal bits will fit.
+ The only product of this type in this price range, so it offers good value for lighter jobs around house to fix shelves, putting together furniture etc.
Negatives:
- The button on the top is not very convenient in the drill position of the handle. I kept looking for the trigger type button found on a regular drill. This is a big minus as it is very cumbersome to use in the angle position due to this problem.
- Only 3.6 V of power, it's not much especially if you're trying to drive in a screw in heavy furniture. A drill with 18V of power shines in those cases.

I had a previous Black and Decker screwdriver suddenly die after a year of light use, so we will see how long this one lasts.",3,"[-2.048155916703377, -1.6546939599668038, -0.6745811668698631, -1.0040300209332025, -1.4109089252714058]",-0.6745811668698631

That sounds like a very difficult task, however Jen has done in with masterful skill. As I read this novel, at times, my heartbeat quickened, then in the next moment I would have a giggle attack!!

The characters are realistically and so well described that the reader easily identifies with them, feeling their every fear, challenge and joy. Margo became my best friend as the story progressed. Her fears became mine!

The plot moves quickly, with the perfect number of  twists and turns unexpectedly occurring that keep one glued to the page. I must admit that I finished reading this book in one day.

Loved this book and the crazy rollercoaster ride that was Ryker and Justine's relationship. The up and downs and all the drama in between!!",2,"[-0.6759535844960897, -1.4633464479777705, -0.7389376661435026, -1.0265550273392798, -0.8464879915280947]",-0.6759535844960897

Charlie and Whiskey have been through more than anyone should. Charlie fled from an abusive relationship. She has softball to make her happy. Whiskey is a member of a MC, tasked to help look after her.

Sparks, emotions, and the power of friendships.

5927,"First, just let me say that I am in LOVE with John Parker McGuiness. When you finish this book, you will be too! For me, this touching story was about the rebirth of a woman (Tammy Hollins) who had never had a chance to know who she was. She came from privilege, but this book proved that money doesnt buy happiness, nor does it stop abuseboth mental AND physical. It is also about the healing power of love and trust and acceptance. Tammy found these things in the embrace of her family and John Parker  and the divorce from her husband Sterling, and her mother  her abusers.

I enjoyed watching Tammy opening uplike one of her flowerspetal by petal, day by day. The development of her relationship with John Parker was much the same. As she learned to trust, she opened more and more to allow the love of a wonderful man into her life  and the life of her children, Annabelle and Rory. THE CHOCOLATE GARDEN is the second book in the Dare River series. It is preceded by Country Heaven, which I recommend that you read first. It too, is an awesome book.

It was fun to catch up with Rye and Tory in this book. Tammy is a lucky girl to have Rye for a brother.  We also get to see the other characters in the series develop. You just want to get in the car and drive to Tennessee so that you can meet these people! Youll also want to grab a shovel and start digging up your back yard to plant your own chocolate garden!

The thing I love most about Ava Miles books is that they are so well written. The characters are multidimensional and well developed. Her voice is down to earth. The characters speak to you. You live the moments, they are not told to you. Romance fans and lovers of women's fiction will devour this poignant and tender novel.  It had me laughing, relating, sympathizing with, and outright loving Tammy, John Parker and the entire cast of supporting characters. With details, funny moments and interesting plot twists Ava Miles scores big with this novel. I highly recommend.

In this movie a young man Matthew vandalizes a church. As soon as you see the parents you know why he did what he did. The parents are constantly fighting and complaining. To the boy things seem impossible. He has no one to turn to.
  The good thing of this movie is Matthew has to help fix up the mess he made. He soon comes to understand and learn many things. When Matthew starts working with the woodcarver he sees the beauty of the wood, sees how he should do things through the saying WWJD {What would Jesus Do}.  Things start to make sense to him and he figures out that he's not alone in life.
 The DVD is very uplifting and heartwarming, but also sad at the same time.
 This DVD is a very worthy DVD to watch and keep. I highly recommend it.

Harley and Clay have been married for one year, they have added a baby to their family  since we last saw them. Will is now two months old and his older brother Jasper is eight. They have decided it was time to visit Harley's sister Hannah and her husband Jackson for a month on the island. If you read the series then you would know this reunion could be very, very awkward. Hannah and Jackson want to give Harley and Clay one night. One perfect and romantic night to be together after the birth of Will so they are going to watch the kids while they go to the Midsummer Luau. But, this one night away can change their lives forever...

It was suppose to be a night to remember. The night to bring them close again and it will be but not in the way they expected. Harley and Clay both have their secrets. Secrets that are just that for the other one's safety. It will all come to a head tonight. All they ever wanted was a normal life. When their secrets are exposed, will they make their lives normal or the cause of more craziness?

I was extremely excited that Lili decided to write a fourth book for Harley and Clay! I can't get enough of this couple. The series is sexy, intense, suspenseful, and twisted. I am really hoping for another spin-off. I won't say with who but I know it would be just as amazing as all of Lili's other series'.

1273,"Every year Debbie Macomber gives us a beautiful Christmas story.
This year I was more than delighted with Merry and Bright.
The story conveys an emotion as I had not felt for a long time.

Merry, who was born on December 26, has an envious inner positive energy.
She works as a temporary employee at a company while saving money to pay for her senior year of college. She wants to be a teacher.
She comes from a solid and loving family.
Her mother suffers from multiple sclerosis and her 18-year-old brother, Patrick, has down syndrome. The family is beautiful.

The Christmas party is a long-awaited tradition. It is at this time that they take the time to thank all the people for their help and support throughout the year by giving them time to cook for these people.

With such a love-filled life story, Merry has clashes with her boss, Jayson Bright.
A handsome man, but always serious, he never smiles.

Jayson carries the responsibility of the VP of his uncle's company on his shoulders. With deadlines and all reports to do, he has no time for social life or smiling.

So when he knows that his cousin, Cooper, was in love and marrying soon, Jayson is astonished. More so to know that the meeting of Cooper and his fianc&eacute;e was through a dating website.

Determined to risk his luck, Jayson signs up, but doesn't put his picture on the profile, but a dog he had in his teens.
Jayson is interested in the profile of a woman whose photo was also a dog.

They exchange messages for some time until they decide to meet each other.
From there everything changes because the woman didn't appear. But, she did. She saw him. She freaked out.

Merry is surprised to discover that the man she had been talking to online was her boss.
Company policy didn't allow for loving relationships between employees.

Always His is the first book in a new series called Crazed Devotion and it starts with a BANG!  We meet Nicole and Ryker and when Ryker leaves to follow his dream of being a Marine, Nicole is left in their small town heartbroken.  Five years past and during that time both of them have had to deal with the decision and the heartbreak Ryker leaving caused.  Ryker comes back to town for a second chance, but may be too late.  Nicole has more than just her own heart on the line this time and isn't sure she can risk it, even though Ryker promises he is back for good and will prove his love.  This book is terrific!  I loved the characters and the thought of second chance romance is one that seems to be one that almost everyone can relate to.....the one that got away.  You need to pick this one up and see if Ryker and Nicole can move forward together or if there is too much to move past.  You will love Ryker, Nicole, Tori, Liz, Elle, Ben, and Luke and may even feel a little something for Tyler.

5 out of 5stars
This is the third book in the Twisted Hearts Love series and I simply love it. Ms. Sands is amazing writer and she defiantly has me as a loyal read. I read this book in one sitting I just couldn't put it down I was so intrigued by the first page to the last. The characters are well developed and the story line is a dark romance read. We also get to see some of our favorite characters and what they are up too.
We met Brenda and Magnum in Mayhem book two of this series. These two pulled at my strings but I really wanted to jump Magnum and make him mine. LOL
From the time he laid eyes on Brenda, over a year ago, he wanted to taste every inch of her. The need ran so deep, he pushed her away. Thats his problem. He pushes everyone away; anyone who dares to get too close. The bonds of his past prevent him from moving forward, but his need for her compels him to break them. Now shes in danger, and hell die before he lets anything happen to her. Its a race against time, between his past and saving her. Will time run out on both of them, or will they forever be bonded?
When she first met Magnum, she thought sex was all she wanted. Or at least thats what she told herself. She hasn't allowed a man into her heart in over ten years, but one moment with him tore down walls that she meticulously built. Shes still forever bonded to a moment in that time, ten years ago; a moment that threatens to come back on the ten-year anniversary of that fateful day. Magnum has sworn to protect her, but shes not sure even he can save her from this nightmare. Shes always been told that time breaks old bonds but will she be able to break her own and move forward into the unknown with Magnum?

The bonds of their past hold them back can they break their walls down to find a happily ever after? Can he save her in time?
This is a great series/book and I highly recommend it. This series is meant to be a fast paced thrill ride while touching on hard subjects so this book is not for everyone.

The Scout's Goodnight Flashlight is just so darn cute, it will appeal to both adults and kids.  It's a great size for 2-3 yr olds, about 7"" tall and 3-4"" wide.  It has a very easy to hold handle for little hands.  The colors are just as depicted.  The red button for choosing songs, like quiet time songs!  When pressed  the top of the flashlight lights up illuminating numbers stars, moons etc on the wall/ceiling and the light changes color.  Being older and more wily now, this is our favorite button! When the big yellow button on the handle is pressed, there's almost a Warner Bros cartoon melody that plays, then when pressed again the planets appear and a pleasant young voice counts out loud for the number of planets which appear.
 This toy is what I call fun learning.  In a fun way you can teach kids to identify and learn basic numbers, symbols like star and moons, what are planets and why are they all different colors and where are they anyway?  It's quite a fun flashlight and I enjoy using it too!
We also have two other Leapfrog toys for toddlers - Melody the Musical Turtle and the Count Along Cash Register.  Both of those are BIG hits.  Nicely made to hold up to a toddlers play, passive learning through play and the songs and musical melodies really appeal to kids.  By the time I'm tired of hearing the melodies I can easily block them out but really they aren't that bad.  Definetely recommend and it has a great price point.

Personally, I thought The Edge of Never did not need a sequel. It is beautiful as it is and the additional hospital scene written from Andrews point of view (kindle update) polished the story perfectly. However, after reading The Edge of Always, I feel the entire book is an ode to Camryn and Andrews love for each other. They experience things that test their relationship and they learn from moments of weakness and continue to grow stronger through their communication and commitment to each other. The book is not all rainbows though, there is pain, heartbreak, and doubt, but true to Camryn and Andrews journey, there is also humor, spontaneity, and lots and lots of love. Parts of the story were slow, but again, I viewed this book as Ms. Redmerskis admiration for her characters connection with each other so the emotional, engaging parts as well as the slow, relaxed parts were all very special. Note: The epilogue made me think that a spin-off may be considered down the line. Who knows? Also, The Edge of Always features the hospital scene from Andrews point of view (from The Edge of Never) in case any readers may have missed it.

My favorite quotes:
Because thats what a moment like this does to you. It makes you feel like something so small inside of something so massive that its beyond comprehension. It strips away all of your problems, all of your hardships, all of your worldly needs and wants and desires, forcing you to realize just how insignificant all of it really is. Its like the Earth becomes completely silent and still, and all that your mind can understand or feel is the vastness of the Universe and you gasp thinking about your place within it. Who needs psychiatrists? Who needs grief counselors and life coaches and motivational speakers? F*** all that. Just stare at the night sky and let yourself get lost in it every now and then.

I guess sometimes the greatest memories are made in the most unlikely of places, further proof that spontaneity is more rewarding than a meticulously planned life. A meticulously planned anything.

Because we only have one life. We get one shot at making it worth living.",3,"[-2.6437051550525505, -1.8663765913565245, -0.6870245818059385, -1.0066019969756186, -1.352536259984118]",-0.6870245818059385

I did not feel that the Amish faith was in any way disrespected, but instead the truth of the Amish faith was shared and honored.  While the Eash family decided that they had to leave the Amish faith, they did not say that they do not love their families or miss them dearly.  Read this five-story account of the truth: plain and simple.  Told with the deepest agony and highest hope!

75,"It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than  I have ever known  -Sydney Carton
The passage above and the opening of the novel--It was the best of times, it was the worst of  times--are among the most often quoted lines from any of Dickens' works, both because they are  memorable and because somehow this is the one work of his that we all get assigned in school.  I  assume this one is chosen because, while it is still great, it is one of his shorter efforts.
The story should be familiar, Dr. Alexander Manette is freed from his unjust imprisonment in the  Bastille and is reunited with his long lost daughter, Lucie, in England.  They are called as witnesses at  the treason trial of Charles Darnay, a dashing young Frenchman.  Darnay too is falsely accused, but he  is saved, in part by his resemblance to a law clerk named Sydney Carton.  Darnay and Lucie  eventually marry, though not before the wastrel Carton declares his love for her and his unworthiness  of her.  He pledges that one day he will prove himself worthy by doing her a service.  That  opportunity comes when Darnay is condemned to death by a French tribunal and sentenced to the  guillotine.
This has been one of my favorite books since the 8th Grade.  There is no more thrilling moment in  literature then when Carton takes Darnay's place and bravely faces certain death.  It is a moment of  redemption that reminds us that great literature serves human purposes; we may never have such a  moment in our own lives, but the example instructs us in how we should face such a situation if the  time comes.  We can ask no more of ourselves than the courage and sense of honor to do that ""far, far  better thing.""

2796,"5 stars! I absolutely loved this story! I had a little bit of that lost feeling when it was over. You know it's good when you go into a small state of mourning.

Chapter 1 of this book had me hooked, I couldn't put it down. I thought the story line was great. I loved the two main characters Evelyn and David. As the synopsis says, they woke up married in Las Vegas and their story evolves from there.

Evelyn seemed like such a normal person that got herself into an extreme situation. I like that she's strong and tries to assert herself. I really loved a particular spot at the end where she stands up for herself. I think she learned a lot about herself and did a lot of growing up.

David is just amazing! He's super hot, sexy, and sweet but has a temper and a lot of buried pain, which unfolds throughout the book. He just seems to be such a kind soul and has a lot of endearing qualities. David matures a tremendous amount over the course of the book and comes to terms with a lot of things and is stronger for it.

Evelyn and David together are perfect! Perfect. They have amazing chemistry and I like their interactions with one another. They also both have some things they need to work on and it made for some really heart wrenching moments. The pain they both go through makes you really feel for them, I was so emotionally invested and caught up in their situation. The turmoil at the end was slightly gut wrenching. I couldn't read fast enough!

The liked the other characters and thought they were introduced well. Mal was awesome! He brought a lot of playfulness and comic relief to the story. I loved all of his banter. This is the first book in a series and I'd love to see him featured at some point.

I thought this was brilliantly written. The story had a good reading pace throughout. There was lots of tension and fighting as well as lots love. And of course there were several SUPER HOT sex scenes!

Loved the chemistry and heat in Lick! I'd definitely recommend this. Such an awesome story!",2,"[-2.5805995613446964, -2.3509907414384705, -0.7119892542963783, -1.0420261486162072, -0.6881444597680823]",-0.6881444597680823

During the course of one fateful week, everything she thought she knew about her life turns out to be a fabrication. Hallie travels to the Lake Superior Island of Manitou, where she was born,  and very, very gradually, she learns the history of the family, the Hills, that she never knew she had. There seems to be only one person on this quaint island, where no motor vehicles are allowed, who is interested in helping Hallie; as it turns out, he was a friend during her unremembered childhood, and is now the local attorney. The rest of the islanders treat her with thinly veiled hostility. No sooner does Hallie disembark on Manitou than she begins to experience unsettling occurrences. Within a few days, she's moved into the Hill mansion (her legacy from her unknown mother) and she's positive she's seeing ghosts, who throw up some serious interference with her attempts to come to terms with who she is. It isn't long before it seems her very life is in danger. Thankfully, she learns that she can trust Will, and it's this blooming relationship that gives her the courage to persevere.

Wendy Webb spins a convincing tale for Hallie, in which the island, which appears frozen in time, is as important a character as she is. Apparitions, poltergeist activity, auditory manifestations, creepy family folklore, a spooky wise woman, and three generations of unexplained deaths all combine to create a deliciously uncanny atmosphere that pervades Hallie's every move. The Tale of Halcyon Crane is a praiseworthy first novel, recommended to readers who enjoy the paranormal without all the gore.

She didn't think she'd ever see Dylan again and she isn't happy he's shown up. Dylan used to be her best friend and the love of her life, but he broke Tilly's heart. What's he doing in Wildstone and can she handle seeing him again?

Dylan would love to be part of Tilly's life again. He thought he set her free when he ended things between them, but causing her grief was the last thing he wanted. He left Wildstone so Tilly could follow her dreams. Dylan's childhood was difficult and he found a way to escape. Tilly was his rock and he wants to make things up to her. He has his own business and a stable home, which means he has a lot more to offer Tilly. Can he win her back?

The Good Luck Sister is a wonderful romantic story. Tilly is a talented person, she's creative, capable and sweet and she genuinely cares about others, which makes her an ideal teacher. Art used to be her life, but Dylan was afraid she'd let go of her dreams to stay with him. He wanted to prevent that and hurt her in the process. He's back in town with a support system this time. He has friends, he knows what he wants and he's in a better situation. Dylan is a kind and charming man and I loved the endearing way he tries to convince Tilly she should give him another chance.

She has started a group that helps make sure siblings of the ill remember that they are still important and entitled to have fun.
Josiah is a billionaire CEO who is recovering from a near fatal blood infection.  He IS resentful and worries for his company, his job, and his sanity.  As bah humbug as they come, Josiah is convinced that spending Christmas at the Bar V5 is going to kill him.

Ellie is determined to help Josiah heal and to show him the joy of Christmas.  Josiah, it seems, actually about to teach HER a few things about joy and giving.  I absolutely adored this book.  Sweet without being fake and cheesy and also funny and wildly romantic, this is a perfect holiday read.",3,"[-1.226074149598967, -1.0473498534318058, -0.6946796794767213, -1.0123625254240622, -1.3383416159526882]",-0.6946796794767213

This is my first A.D. Justice book and I am now a fan. Andi is a great character, who is so easy to relate to, and Luke...oh, Luke. He is a young man every mother hopes their son becomes.

Andis past makes you cry, and makes you understand why she is so guarded and tough. When that past comes back to haunt her, shell need every friend she has to get her through it. Growing up in foster care, family isn't something she can rely on.

Luke, on the other hand, has a supportive family, but one that doesnt understand him and his career choices. He feels he has something to prove. When he meets Andi, he has finally found someone who believes in him. She changes everything.

The world of The Royals that the author has created is beyond fascinating. The characters are so intriguing and complicated. There are so many different layers and things happening. I hung on ever detail. The drama (oh the drama!), the tension, and the angst were all fantastic. The Royals have totally ruined me. I loved the writing, the descriptions, the build, I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. It's all so exciting!

Ella and Reed. Oh man. The push and pull these two have going on with their love hate relationship was so awesome. I loved all their interactions. This is very much Mature YA, if I would have read this as a teen I would have seriously thought I was getting away with something. ;-)

Throughout the story, the Royals family totally grew on me as I learned more about their history. They have this crazy family dynamic happening. It's like I wanted to slap them all and hug them all at the same time and I mean that in a good way!

From the fighting, to the privileged, the scheming, and mean girls I could not wait to see what was going to happen next. I had a gazillion questions when it ended and cannot wait to read the next book. And that ending, freaking killer cliffhanger. I totally yelled at my Kindle.

I'm honestly surprised I remembered to feed my family. I'm not even kidding. Time just stopped and I'd look up and two hours would have passed and I didn't pay attention to my Kindle percentage at all. This was an all consuming, fascinating world I couldn't get enough off.

His touch spirals through me, warm and sweet, wicked and hot. I shouldnt trust him. I shouldnt tell him my secrets. But how do I not when he is the reason I breathe? He is what I need.

Liam Stone is a reclusive billionaire. He always gets what he wants

Lara/Amy/Amy is a girl on the run. She has been since the age of eighteen. She had to change her identity while running from her past  and she is doing it again. On the plane to a new destination, she meets Liam. He knows what he wants  and he wants Amy. He refuses to take no for an answer and sweeps her into an erotic affair. Who is Liam? What does he want from her? Is it more than she has to give?

This book definitely holds your attention from beginning to frustrating end. You will not have the answers at the end of the book. Cliffhanger, deluxe! You will be left as I was  pacing the floor, impatiently anticipating the rest of the story  as you are gob-smacked at the end book #1.

Liam Stone is sexy hot alpha male all the way! You want him to be Amys salvation. You want him to be the herothe good guy  but is he? We don't know

Lisa Renee Jones takes us on a twisting, turning, angst-filled journey that grabs you and doesnt let go. She takes you to the edge of a precipice  then pushes you off! I cant wait for the next chapter in the journey that is Liam and Amy. Bring it on!

Nancy Coco has written a magnificent mystery! I was engaged from the first page until the last. She has created fun and entertaining characters and there are quite a few suspects. I also loved that there were 2 dogs involved in the story. One very well behaved and one not so much. I was laughing as the police were chasing the one who refused to drop his sensational find.  Again Allie is under  suspicion but she is hot on the trail to clear her name.

I love the setting too. It has been many years since I visited Mackinaw Island but I remember the great time we had. It is a truly a unique place and if you are in the area one you should definitely visit. Because of its location it is a great place to have a mystery or two or more.

This cozy has it all  a well plotted mystery, fantastic characters, the perfect amount of humor, all set in a beautiful place.

Because Logan had been hurt in the past he now had his walls closed around him, never letting anyone in only his two friends Bash and Shaw. Now he's a party and one night stand kind of guy.
Jackson works for his father's company and doing what everyone else wants and expects of him making him feel lonely and not who he really is.

The chemistry between these two guys was insane. I loved the push and pull between them and how Lucas tried to push Jackson away but he wouldn't budge. Jackson was determined to show Lucas that nothing would come between them again. Their past history was also something that made me connect and fall in love with them even more. Lucas' friends Bash and Shaw were fabulous. I loved them just as much and they flowed well with story. A great introduction of the two of them.

I've read Brooke Blaine's L.A. Liaisons series and loved that as well. With A Little Bit Like Love Blaine has created another wonderful series with intriguing characters who have so many layers. I'm so excited for the next book cause this one was fantastic.

So I like the fact that this MARWARE CLEAR SCREEN PROTECTOR KIT FOR KINDLE FIRE HDX 8.9"" includes two sheets of protective film.  It gives you two chances at achieving a perfect, bubble-free installation.

This film is cut to the exact size of the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9"" screen, and it has a cutout circle for the front-facing camera.  The film is perfectly clear, and doesn't interfere with the sensitivity of the touchscreen.

The film is stiff enough to be fairly easy to handle during the application.  It has protective sheets on both sides.  First, you clean the HDX screen with the included microfiber cloth.  Second, you remove the protective sheet (#1 tab) from the weak adhesive side of the film.  Third, you apply the film to the HDX screen.  Fourth, you remove the remaining protective sheet (#2 tab).  Finally, you smooth the bubbles out with the included stiff cardboard ""squeegee"".  If you want to try again, the protective film peels off easily without leaving any residue.

As usual, I ended up with a few tiny bubbles after my second installation attempt.  However, each of my two attempts resulted in a nearly perfect installation.

The catch is that kids are the only ones that can see and fight the ghosts. The older they get, the less they can see so this is a world where adults are constantly scared and kids have to protect them. Lockwood & Comp. is the only adult free company in London. It is run by Lockwood, Lucy, and George.

But there is fierce competition between the different companies. Through a job gone wrong and a house burning down, the kids are given the task of working on Combe Carey Hall, the most haunted house in London. The catch is no one has gotten out alive.

I really like Jonathan Strouds other books so I was excited to read this one. I instantly got sucked in and couldn't wait to see what happened next. The kids were great. I liked each of their personalities but really loved Lucy. The story is scary but its done in a way that is not gruesome for kids. Although I think parents should read the book first to decide if their younger kids would like it.

This is a great story and I cant wait for others to follow. This is one for all ages of readers.

Terrific narration giving each character a distinctive sound and deepening the story these authors created.  Smooth and enjoyable.  If any problem it was when a moment in the book is full of surprising action and the narrators voice speeds up so fast I struggled to understand and follow along.  A few 30 second rewinds and I had caught it all but I did feel that that portion of the story was a bit overplayed.

When Logan sees Charlotte at a conference he sets out to do everything he can to make her his.  No matter whether its good business or not, his Rose will be within his reach and he won't let her go.
Rose is relatively new to her position within the company when they are taken over by another company.  Suddenly shes being uprooted and moved.  Despite her nerves, shes excited and shell do her very best.  That is until she walks in and sees the man she never thought shed see again.
This actually is very well developed with a bit of mystery, some drama and some heart wrenching angst.  I hurt when Rose didn't get what she needed from Logan but when the truth is revealed it went from heart wrenching to heart breaking.  I would definitely say this one is a bit heavier than this duos usual works.

9800,"This is a broth made of people grade food for dogs and (supposedly) cats that does have some great nutritional benefits, including loads of collagen. I would think that most dogs would love this broth, and it might also benefit those dogs who have issues with digestion due to illness or other food sensitivities (in conjunction with approval from your veterinarian, of course). It is easily made--just add hot water to the powdered broth, stir,  and then let it cool before feeding it to your pet.

I would have given this product 5 stars if I believed, as advertised, that it would be palatable for most cats, but I don't think that is the case. I realize, at this time, I have only tried to feed it to two different cats (and neither would touch it after one little lap of the tongue), but I have owned cats for many, many years and feel I have enough expertise on their feeding habits to judge more expansively. Anything with Turmeric and little bits of parsley (or some other green herb) floating in it will probably not be attractive to most cats. Maybe if they were started on it when they were young kittens, it might work. But that is still a big maybe. Cats are definitely picky eaters.

6390,"What I always love about Kate Canterbarys books is that she always gives readers a romance with heart. Even when we get to the steamier scenes, we still can feel the love and care between the two characters, and it makes me fall in love with her characters and stories every single time.

Owen and Cole are seemingly opposites in every capacity. Owen is a man who lives in relative isolation and spends his days catching lobster and preserving the cove and his nights on the porch with a book. Cole is the famous face of a tech company looking to escape. When these two are together, though, they are perfect for each other. They bring out the best. Cole is able to think freely and get back the innovation he has been lacking, almost garnering inspiration from his love with Owen. He isn't the only one to change. Owen, this gruff and seemingly abrasive man, reveals his soft side when he is with Cole! I just adored seeing them together, and the way they loved each other, emotionally and physically, warmed my soul.

Most of the Kate Canterbary novels I have read have been relatively slow burns, but Fresh Catch picks up steam rather quickly, and the attraction from the moment they meet charges the air around them. I honestly was consumed by their relationship and the way they care for another. I felt like I had to savor every moment between them because the book would end all too soon. What I wish I would have gotten is maybe a bit more of them as individuals. I love them together and enjoyed them as individuals, but I connect with them as a couple versus individual characters. The conflict also comes late and is resolved quickly, but for the conflict selected, the resolution matches the story and the characterization created. I absolutely adored the ending. Owens made my heart all weepy and happy.

Fresh Catch is another fantastic read.

This is a story about a highschool girl who is bullied and then ends her own life. But what makes it so unique is that the story is told from the perspective of one of the girls who harasses Emma and who makes her life unbearable. The author made me see that there are definitely two sides to bullying and that the victim isn't always as innocent as is often believed. At the same time she isn't justifying what these kids did to Emma, but she brings to light the events that motivated these girls and made them feel justified in their actions.

Landon is a millionaire who has a mission he needs help with.  He is stuck babysitting his nephew and needs someone to help him with this task.  Angel, Landon's sister has suggested he hire her best friend Kimber for this job.  Although Kimber has no experience with kids, she takes the job because she needs the money for her business.  She's been trying to buy out her ex who happens to be her co-owner of her store.

Kimber has always had a thing for Landon.  She has been friends with Angel since they were kids and she secretly harbored a crush on Landon.  Landon has never seen Kimber in any way other than just a friend.  So when he sees her again, he can't believe what a beautiful woman she has turned out to be.  Landon has guarded his heart ever since what happened with his girlfriend from college, she really broke his heart and he's had nothing but arranged girlfriend's since then.

What Landon didn't expect was for his feelings for Kimber to turn to true love.  He watched how she interacted with his nephew and he longed for that, he longed for a family that he could have had when he was in college, he just didn't realize it.

Can Landon woo Kimber and make his dream come true by becoming a family with her?  Can Kimber accept his proposal's or is she going to continue being stubborn and keep him at arm's length?

This was a very steamy read and the sex scenes were hot!

The ending to this love story was just perfect.  You can't beat a beautiful happily ever after!

I would not suggest these toys for kids much younger than this due to the darts being plastic and they come out fast and hard when they hit.
It does come with a small target that you can use with it. We actually went out to the store to get the BIG target for them to play with though the do prefer to just play games that do not include using the targets. If you do use the targets these darts will stick to them so is easy to keep score.
That being said my boys LOVE these things once they got used to them and mom set up the rules. They have not had any issues loading and shooting these blasters. They now have more BOOMco toys on their wish list for Christmas because they like them better than the 20 some Nerf shooters.

The story just continues right back to these two knuckleheads, Finn and Hadley both to stubborn and afraid of rejection. Finn has his own problems with commitment because of the divorces his parents went through so he strongly believes everyone is doomed if they marry. He knows deep down that's not true for everyone he just needs to consciously admit it. Hadley has her own abandonment issues and doesn't believe somebody could love her so unconditionally. The issue of marriage and babies it at the top of the list, along with why they should live together and when it should happen. They are at an impasse and both want what the other can't give at the moment. The things Finn does to get Hadley, or Becks, his nickname for her, to understand he's there forever are priceless and would make any woman fall to his feet confessing their undying love right back. But Hadley keeps feeling like it's not enough and that's she isn't good enough for the sexy, daredevil sportscaster. They struggle throughout the book about who needs to give in to who. There is a part in the book that made me laugh out loud so hard, hysterical, tears running down my face funny. This book will make you upset and furious that you'll wish you could just reach in and knock some sense into both Finn and Hadley. But it will also make you want your own unconditional lover.

Shortly after having her second baby, Jenn was diagnosed with breast cancer. It's been over a year since her battle started and she finds herself at an experimental facility that's her last hope of beating cancer.

Jenn's extremely lucky, but sometimes she can't see it. Her husband, Henry, is nothing short of amazing and she's surrounded by a very loving and supportive group of friends. Friends that are helping her plan a life celebration, so she can spend time with the people that have meant the most to her. Ralph, her best friend at the facility, is the only one that really understands what she's going through and can cheer her up like no one else.

She just can't shake the loneliness and isolation she feels while all her loved ones are out living their lives without her. Some of the decisions she makes are gut-wrenching, but in a crazy way understandable. She loves her husband, but she wants him to look at her as more than just another responsibility. She wants to feel desired.

I really grew to care about these characters and didn't want to let them go. Ralph was one of my favorites, but also one of the most depressing parts of the story. The only part of the book that I found lacking was the ending. I wanted more closure.

The Remaining: Aftermath is an equally action packed horrific zombie joyride that does not suffer from envy from the first book what so ever. While there may be not quite as much edge of your seat suspense, there is enough of everything else to make me very happy. D. J. Molles expands the post apocalyptic world he created in The Remaining as Captain Lee Harden must fight for the survival of the refugees he found at the end of book one. There is something about the military-esk point of view on the zombie invasion that is so thrilling to me, confident military men that are either brought to their knees or can overcome to lead and protect, and sometimes both. While there may be nothing truly unique about this story so far, there are enough interesting characters to keep me hooked and truly invested in their welfare.

I like the Apple logo showing through the case.  That was a nice design touch.

Besides protecting the iPad, the case has a built-in keyboard for getting information into your iPad.  Although the virtual keyboard is available on the iPad, this physical keyboard is much better when you have a lot of typing to do.

This story centers around Luca a successful tattoo artist who has a huge chip on his shoulder from a previous relationship and Kerry a strong , hard working women, who meet one night at Luca's shop and she becomes somewhat of the game changer in his life.

9039,"Everett and his twin sister have been making music forever -- literally. They're the children of a rockstar; music has always been their life. When their father's group decides to get back together (dad always said he'd go back when the twins were done with school), Mason tells the label -- if you take me, you're taking my kids: thus, giving Everett and Ashlynn the opportunity to take their music to a larger level than they have before.

Along the way, with a local gig, Everett meets Belle -- and so begins their story.

This is a story about growing up. This is a story about following your heart -- be it for a person or a career, or even both. It is about learning to trust the person you are giving your heart to, and about taking the ever-looming jump into unknown feelings. When you put your life, your wants, your desires in someone else's hands, the world opens up -- and it certainly does for Everett and Belle.

The part I most appreciated was that the author made Everett true to his age and situation. Belle was too, yes, but it was Everett and his new lifestyle that had me wanting to see true characterization for. He's a guy; he's a musician; he's new to love. He makes mistakes. And for those mistakes, I truly got on board with this story.

Everett and his Tinker Bell were incredibly cute. I liked that there's a decent time jump at the end, further allowing -- you guessed it -- growth of our characters. I'm excited to watch more of them when (if?) Ashlynn's story comes out.

I love the anticipation, the storyline, the danger that is looming, all the twists and turns that filled each pages that would make you gasp, and lets not forget the love story that is growing that is total swoon-worthy.

The characters were amazing as well. Sergio is still grieving, and it was just beautiful how everything turned out for him. And our sweet Val, whos one of my favorite female leads in the series right now. The both of them were pretty much amazing! You cant help but just fall in love with them!

EMPIRE was a story of second chance  in love, and in life. Its a story of letting go, finding love and hope even at the bleakest of times.

First off, it's just a happy looking thing. You put it on your counter with suction cups and it looks like a futuristic toy of some kind-- but it works quite well. It skips a spot every now and then, and if your apple is too small, it may not work right, but for standard-size ripe apples, it does a good job.

It rinses off easily. You just have to remember to cover the blade afterwards to avoid leaving an exposed razor on your counter (especially if you have kids or pets).

Before we know if, Alana has stumbled upon her first and only love and now faces her past and the ever adoring Ryan. It doesn't take him long to convince Alana that he deserves, no that they deserve a second chance.

She is ready to jump full on into the joy and experiences of life; he, on the other hand, is reticent and emotionally wounded from the war. Her love opens his heart and in time they marry. Living on isolated Janus Rock is a wondrous Island paradise for the newlyweds, but the supply ship only comes there infrequently, and there is no medical care. When Isabel gets pregnant, and keeps losing the babies it is heartbreaking for both of them. Soon after they bury a still born son, a boat floats in on the tide and inside is a man's body and a tiny crying baby girl. Isabel thinks the baby is a ""gift from God"" and the decision they make about the baby sets in motion circumstances that are touching and devastating to everyone.

Since he hasn't been back in a while, he stopped in at the store he used to work at as a teen, to visit the owner, Gordon. Only to find him shot in the head. Knowing Gordon's daughter, Mia, was his sister's best friend, Hawk called Eva with the news. Both women were there in minutes.

Turns out that not only was Gordon shot but his gun case in the store had been broken into and all of the guns stolen, along with his cache of guns in another nearby building. When Hawk heard the rumors about bomb-making equipment and a pile of guns being hidden around the town, he called his SEAL team.

Mia became an important part of the search because of her extensive knowledge of the underground caves and tunnels in the area. She is part of a search and rescue team that finds tourists when they get lost in the tunnels. But her participation makes the terrorists believe she knows more than she does and they kidnap her - several times. The SEALs keep rescuing her though.

I liked the way Hawk was always able to save Mia. But couldn't believe how often he left her alone. OK, he did tell her to stay safe and to stay put, but he had to know she wasn't going to just sit back and do nothing. So she went and got herself kidnapped over and over. Even with the way she attracted trouble, overall she was a strong woman who stuck up for herself. Even with Hawk. She wouldn't take any flack from him.

What a great SEAL team. They constantly had each other's backs whether they were on duty or not. It was cute that they kept asking Hawk if he was going to keep her (Mia) because they wanted her if he didn't.

Brooke runs into trouble one day and witnesses something that she shouldn't. She ends up calling Cade and asks him to come get her.

This is a heartbreaking story of first love, loss and ultimately deciding on a path that is right for you.

Lexi is completely into Joel.  Shes seen as rebelling when she sees herself as finally being free.  Once it all goes too far she is sent away to her grandparents- this is where her true breakthrough begins. With distance from Joel Lexi begins to see things very differently.

While there is some not a lot of strong language the book is a good clean fun mystery love story that you find your self cheering for the characters and wanting and hoping for a good thing to happen. This book is about finding love in the darkest place in someones life while still holding your head high and fighting the past that could make you or break you. I had a hard time putting this book and not staying up late to finish it. Such a great book to add to your To be read pile..

Unfortunately she believed she needed to play it safe to protect herself and that backfired on her big time. So she went clubbing to look for a rebound guy and found talented, sexy, British DJ, Damon Stone. Damon has been attracted to Trihnity Hamilton for awhile and wanted more than a one night stand. Will Damon be able to break down the walls that Trihn has built to protect her heart? Is Damon as perfect and devoted as he appears to be? I fell in love with Damon right from the start. He took his time working his way into Trihn's heart. He was sweet, thoughtful, and patient, knowing she needed time to work through her trust issues. Trihn is beautiful, smart, and vulnerable yet so strong as she strives to overcome her past and her belief that she wasn't  good enough for anyone.  The thing I loved about this story is how the events and struggles felt genuine and organic. There wasn't any forced drama or angst, just lovers and friends getting to know, trust, and support one another as they navigate where life takes them. The banter was fun, and the chemistry between Damon and Trihn was smokin' hot. I truly enjoyed this wonderful story of love and redemption and I look forward to reading more from this author!",2,"[-2.763495216947748, -1.5119880079957384, -0.9729681449167747, -1.0496522809544735, -0.7237868728297241]",-0.7237868728297241

WOW!!!!! Loved this book!!! Love the series but this book was really, really good!!
This author knows how to put a story together so that it flows seamlessly from one scene to the next, even when there's tons of action and different settings.
I absolutely love the characters! You gotta love a story like this of finding an alien ship with an AI on board in the computer system, who later becomes your best friend, neighbor and then he actually becomes his physical, stand at his side partner in all things (other than the physical/emotional
love component) when Julien (SADE)  evolves into a physically walking, talking, independent and free SADE.
I think the Julien character and his evolving persona is awesome, very creative. It's also smart to include the other SADE's and not just focus on Julien. They offer a lot to the story and it's fun to see them evolve. It will be really interesting to see what the author does with them now, to see what the author comes up with for their individual evolvements in the next book and future books. I say future books because this is one of those series that you want to continue to read because the characters and the storyline becomes so engaging.
I can't wait for #5!!
Editing: awesome! Well written and edited.
Age: adult, perhaps High School age- mild discussion of sex, space ship battles and casualties.

Overcoming all the hurdles of growing up and trying to become what you have dreamed of, is the road we all take.

Transfer picks up right where Retrieval left off and this time around the focus is more intense on Clare and Heath. Roman and Elisabeth have found their way back to each other and now with their help, it is the hope that both physical and emotional demons can finally be exorcised from everyone's lives. This foursome has had a rough time digesting everything thrown at them in such a short period of time. But what is the most glorious about this entire saga is that it's the love that continues to see them through. No amount of pain can deter them from grabbing onto that slim chance at happiness, even when it means great sacrifice and separation.

Hating to have to be so vague, I just don't want to ruin the nature of this duet. It is such a unique story-line that deserves to be savored without any spoilers.

Aly Martinez has given us her all in this one. Her heart and soul has touched every page. The characters are well-written and thoughtful. You can't help but be drawn in by every action, every emotion laid bare by Roman, Elisabeth, Heath, Clare and that scene-stealer in Tessa. It will be tough for the fans to decide who they love the most: Roman or Heath. For me, I'm going with Clare. She blossoms beautifully in this book and becomes the brave warrior, the survivor I always knew she had in her. As much as the men made me swoon and believe me they did and often, to me this was a book written for the heroines. Elisabeth and Clare show strength and grace in the face of endless uncertainty.

I cannot recommend this duet highly enough. You will read that last page and will still be clamoring for more. And your heart will be full.

Simply superb in every single way. 5++++++++ stars!",4,"[-3.0034266198290442, -1.8146202804626577, -0.7305115074038365, -1.037464403488342, -0.9371995472002133]",-0.7305115074038365

Having really enjoyed that series, I had high hopes for this start to the Forever Freedom serieswanting to experience more perspective on both the cause and the Quaker way of faithand Im glad to say it doesnt disappoint.

Set in the mid-1800s, Summer on Sunset Ridge brings an abolition-minded Quaker, Rebecca Albright and a slave-pursuing sheriff, Clay Dalton, together in the most frightful of ways. Yet, chemistry abounds as these two characters each wrestle with faith, purpose, and what the future might hold and experience significant growth over the course of the novel. Their development individually and romantically is emotional, sweet, encouraging and delivers an important message. All in all, this story of Rebecca and Clay offers a heartwarming historical read.

So, readers in need of fascinating history and sweet romance interwoven with uplifting spiritual reminders, definitely consider Summer on Sunset Ridge. I quite enjoyed it, as Im sure many readers of inspirational historical fiction will, too.

I would suggest reading #1 ""Hush"", just because this is an outstanding series, thus far. Another, T-FLAC novel. Thrills and chills, twists and turns, as well, passion, suspense, and romance. A roller- coaster of a thrill ride from beginning to the end and beyond.

Well written with tantalizing scenes, vivid descriptions, charismatic characters, adventure, action, and of course a track through the Jungle with an enemy on their trail (the reader can almost taste, feel and smell the Jungle). The H/H is awesome, oh wait, they are engaging, charismatic, energetic and did I mention passionate, in more ways than just sex. Although, the sensual tension is just as awesome, as well. A keeper! Another hit from another awesome Romantic Suspense author! Well done! I look forward to the next installment of this high-octane adventure. The  T-FLAC team is a tough as nails unit. Another hit from Cherry Adair. Highly recommended for Romantic Suspense fans and anyone who enjoys a thrill-ride packed full of action, romance and love. Any more heat and action and the pages would be on fire. Simply, breathless and priceless!! If you only pick up one Romantic Suspense, this month, let it be ""Gideon"", you will not regret your choice!

In Alex, we are introduced to the enigma who is Alex Crossman. The angry-at-the-world hockey star that no one can reach. When his attitude goes beyond his teammates and causes fans to become angry, the owners figured it times to shape him up or ship him out.

When Alex is forced to work with Sutton Price to repair his image, he doesn't realize that she's going to turn his world inside out. Finding that she's the one person who can see inside of him to the person he really is leaves him feeling exposed, uncertain. How does he deal with the little creature? How can one little one possess so much control over him and make him feel so small?

When the truth comes out that they have more in common than either realized, bonds will be formed, that no matter how hard they try to break them, they are unbreakable.

Sawyer Bennett has been a phenomenal writer since the first time I read her work.

1047,"This is another Katie McGarry book I thoroughly enjoyed reading. She continues prove why she's one of my favorite realistic contemporary YA authors. McGarry has a knack for writing true to life characters, stories that emotionally get to me, and a romance that is full of tension and swoon worthy moments. This edgy, realistic, coming of age story is full of heartbreak, hope, and centers on two strong characters who fight for each other as much as their own freedom to just be themselves.

McGarry writes teenage stories perfectly. I love the way she creates characters who have realistic, far from perfect lives. They learn to stand up for themselves, while in the process navigate their own lives, figure out who they are, and what it is they want. This story, like her previous ones is full of all the emotions, and experiences that come with being on the bring of independence. Like her previous characters, Elle and Drix quickly became characters I cared about.

I absolutely loved that Elle became a character who found her voice, and wasn't afraid to use it. I greatly admired her for standing her ground. Drix is a little bit more complicated. What I liked about him, is that he accepted Elle for who she was, and helped her embrace the strong willed girl she was with him, vs the timid soft spoken girl she became around her over controlling parents. Elle and Drix brought out the best in each other, without forcing the other into being someone they aren't.

I'm really hoping we'll get more from the characters in this book. Aside from Elle and Drix, there's a few characters I really enjoyed getting to know more about, like Axle and Holiday, Drix's brother and sister. I love that the secondary characters in this book play just as big as a role in the story as Elle and Drix. There's a couple cringe worthy characters in this book, including some adults.

McGarry's book never disappoint me. This is another fast paced read I really enjoyed. Like each of her previous books, there is some mild language, and sexual tensions that lead to a few swoonworthy moments.",4,"[-1.8504434082316705, -1.8615463602565936, -0.7327713239818245, -1.027009252672073, -0.9901035381256091]",-0.7327713239818245

I was dying to get my hands on Axel and Marie's story! When I read Monday and Tuesday, I was so envious of their perfect relationship. They were always so in love and it seemed to happen in a blink of an eye. Reading Thursday, you see what really happened. Their relationship happened over a longer period of time then I realized.

When he finally gets his chance with Marie, he expects nothing more than one night together. He never thought it was going to turn into more.

6117,"I first became intrigued with Grayson and Sam in Full Measures and then even more so in Eyes Turned Skyward, but I fell in love with them both in Beyond What Is Given.

Grayson is an amazing romance hero and Samantha is the perfect heroine to capture his heart with her feisty nature, her deep vulnerabilities, and her very real secrets and regrets. My heart went out to them in this book so much. Theyve been through the wringer, in very different ways, and yet, despite how they think, theyve managed to survive the guilt and pain to pick themselves up and carry on with their lives. They are stronger than they know and they each bring out the best in each other, though at times, they also bring out the worst because they understand each other in a way no one else ever could. Despite the secrets that still lay between them.

Beyond What Is Given is an expertly written new adult military romance that will capture your heart and touch your soul. Its one of those books that will get inside you and make you think about lifeand the people within itin a wholly different way. It will make you think about sacrifice and loyalty and what it means to love someone, truly love them, with all of their flaws and insecurities and past mistakes on full display. It will make you think about the measure of a man, the strength of a woman, and the risk they must take to find happiness and love within themselves and in each other.

This book will also make you think about family, both those you are born into and those you make for yourself.

Sweet Dreams is one of those reads that pulled me in deep, it had me smiling and giggling, and sighing with contentment. Nina Lane is one of my very most favorite authors and I knew it was only a matter of time before I would read it. But like Polly, I believe things happen in life at certain times, when you need them to happen. Sweet Dreams has everything I needed and Ninas characters are always well developed, funny, smart and lovable. Her couples are perfectly matched and Luke Stone and Polly Lockhart have a real sizzle and rank up there among my favorites. I needed a *sweet* read and i got it.

Nina gives her characters detailed traits and this is what makes her characters so rounded and relatable. Everything about Pollys backstory intrigued me; life at Twelve Oaks ( might she know Olivia West?), her ambition and how that harmonizes with her smooth hippie girl ways, and just how in tune she is to people, Luke in particular. I was in love with Luke the moment he said to Polly  I don't remember any redheadI only remember you. I swooned time and time again as he teases her with silly jokes, and went along with Pollys date ideas. As their relationship develops and he seems to forget he his declaration that he cant make any promises, he transforms in the subtle ways. But I think mostly Polly just relaxes him and he cant help but to show another side to himself. Together these two are scorching hot and Im reminded how well Nina writes intimacy and sexy times.

I read Sweet Surrender (bk 3) first and was more than intrigued about Luke Stone, and of course the woman who captured his heart, Polly. Im thrilled to have finally read their story. I just get Polly as Im a Sagittarius too (sensitive and prone to excessive enthusiasm).

Her power lies in family secrets, her own as well as those of her son Edward, her daughter Rose, her half-sister Queenie, her maid Violet and the local butcher Spud.  Readers get to know her through the narration of Queenie, including Iriss eccentric gastronomical preferences for exotic meats like rattlesnake sauted in garlic and onions.  Queenie describes her secret food preference of Kentucky Fried Chicken with belly-laughing commentary.  Anyone who manages to offend Iris usually suffers negative results as Iris writes superiors no matter how high up they are from the local editor of the newspaper all the way to the President and the Pope.  Queenie manages to laugh at it all.
For Queenie, her mother Sally and Violet all practice the voodoo art of Gullah, creating mostly protective spells for those they love, although some suspect an occasional curse has also been set elsewhere. They are African-Americans who know how to love and enjoy life, sharing humor, laughter, and son in the middle of the direst times.  Now we come to the initial moment of great conflict, the dying process of Iris who has a stroke after the first secret from the Book of Secrets is revealed in the local newspaper.  As these are supposed to be locked up in a bank vault, everyone who knew Iris Temple is petrified about whether his or her secret will next be revealed.  Soon protestors are leaving obnoxious posters and other items outside the Temple residence, a useless gesture as the daily shocking announcements continue.
Iris is dying and the ghosts of the house are busy, busy, busy!  Ivy will not go easy and the scene describing her eventual passing is absolutely amazing!  So too is the reading of the will and the choices of the beneficiaries are wild, to say the least!
Sally and Queenie save these characters from becoming scarred, bitter people.  The scenes of their conversations and the ensuing healing are so real and heart-warming, never to be forgotten by any and all readers. Descriptions of luscious Southern meals are scattered throughout the novel as well!

1939,"I have never read any other books or articles or seen any television shows by Shawn Achor before reading this book. His ideas make a lot of sense to me but I almost feel like I need a seminar to take what I have read and really make it work in my life.  This is not a simple self-help book full of positive ideas on how to be happy, but rather an, at times, almost technical look at how happiness happens.

The author uses a five step approach to get a person to the point where they can experience happiness. For me the steps are as follows:

1. Have a willingness to look at things differently to open up more paths to being happy;
2. Define what matters most in life and what will bring you happiness and then have a plan to make these goals happen;
3. Find ways of moving more quickly to these goals;
4. Don't allow other happenings interfere with reaching these goals; and,
5. Help others around you see the importance of your goals so you are not experiencing them in a vacuum.

The author uses personal experiences and psychological studies to explain his views on happiness. His logic is sound and even the technical aspects of what he was saying was understandable.

I do think I was at a slight disadvantage having never read or seen anything by the author. I will  watch his show on PBS and will read more of what he has written.

I am glad I read this book and will attempt to use what I have learned in my life.

673,"Though many other factors influenced the stormy relationship existing between Britain and its former colony during this trying period, these were by far the major ones.  Slavery had been introduced and fostered in America by the mother country, but now the English had banished it from their remaining possessions, and its extensive navy was relentlessly pursuing the slavers who still plied their trade.  For many in England, regardless of class, slavery was anathema.  And then there was cotton, which Britain's thriving cloth industry desperately needed.  The competing influence of these two factors continued to affect British attitudes toward the warring parties--the repugnance of slavery pushing them toward the North, the temptation of thousands of cotton bales pulling them toward the South.  But the third factor played no favorites, as young men rushed to join the armies of both sides.  And, when more cannon fodder was required, there were always foreigners around--British subjects were everywhere--who could be forced to join, especially by the Confederacy which soon was exhausting its supply of recruits.

These are the elements which are stressed in A World on Fire and done extremely well, as Foreman surveys this world of war and intrigue through the eyes of the participants, from the English soldiers and officers in the midst of battle to the American head of the legation in London and his counterpart in Washington--Charles Adams and Lord Richard Lyons, respectively.  Both of these diplomats struggle to keep the relationships of their respective countries on and even keel, both have to contend with the political vagaries of the nation they represent and the equally frustrating attitudes of the one they have to deal with on a daily basis.

What makes A World on Fire especially fascinating is this overlay of personalities on a background of horrific carnage.  These are real people reporting their encounter with a war that all too faithfully presages the ultimate catastrophe a half-century into the future.  British participants, on both sides of the conflict, write home about the friends they make and the enemies they encounter, on and off the battlefield.

Anyone with even a passing interest in the Civil War will find engrossing reading in these pages richly supplied with the illustrations of that period--especially the inimitable Punch cartoons.

But that's okay because his best friend's sister Layla, who he's been given strict instructions to stay away from, is going to be the woman that could change his life in ways he wasn't looking for. First they have to admit there's more to their weekend flirting.

Branch is a guy who's uber confident, and given he's an MVP, he can definitely live up to the rumors. and Layla is the woman who can tame this football hero in every way possible.

It gives them ideas on how to fill other people's buckets and keep their own bucket full as well.  It also goes into bucket dipping, or trying to steal someone else's happiness.  Bucket dipping never works because when you empty someone else's happiness bucket, yours empties too.

5009,"You know when you watch a scary movie and you get the shivers? Well this happened here. It gave me shivers but in a good way. I couldn't put the book down until the last page. There are so many ranges of emotions at play here that the MC go thru, feel and experience. There are many things at play, that Kyle the heroine and Garin the hero go thru to get out the other side. They were childhood best friends and came from a place of poverty and ended up depending only on each other and their other best friend to survive in The Heart which is where they lived. They were as close as any friends could be until that night tore them apart.
Years later they (Garin and Kyle) are brought back together by another person, to where it all started. It a dark and twisted winding road of taking a look back at how these two friends who really loved each other back then were kept apart- the who, the why and how. Oh there is so many things at play and all I can tell you is there is layers apon layers to this story and the author did a great job and portraying Garin as the hero with a dark side , and Kyle who is hardened yet there is still a touch of innocence to her.  Again, layers apon layers to the characters that she peels back until we get to who they really are. I highly recommend reading this story but read it with the lights on.  I want to go in depth but it would be giving away the story and that I just cant do. I want to tell you how great it is, I want to go further but if I do, I would end up giving the story away and that is spoilers. So no, just purchase and you cant go wrong.

We hear his thoughts and feelings on everything that happened in regards to his relationship with Arion.  And we get to see how those events shaped him.

Nate has gone through so much and the nightmares that plague him haven't allowed him to get over Arion or forget the past.  He came home hoping to find his fiance waiting for him only to learn she had moved on.  This definitely makes him a little bitter and pushes him to bury his feelings in meaningless sex.

A health scare with his mother causes him to fall back into the abyss of despair that war brought onto him.  But when he decides that he wants to be close to her and looks into buying a home, his life suddenly takes a turn.

Elania is the Real Estate Agent that helps Nate search for the perfect place.  She is also hiding scars from a past that haunts her.  Nate and Elania find themselves attracted to each other, but try hard not to give in to any deeper feelings.  We all know what happens when fate intervenes ;-)
Both Elania and Nate are in constant battle with their past, with their feelings, and with each other.  Their friendship brings a sense of peace and light to their life, but although the walls slowly seem to fall, their stubborn disposition tries to erect them again.

I loved the way LK slowly brought them together and showed how broken hearts can mend when a simple smile is given with sincerity and love.  Elania and Nate learn that providing that shoulder for each other is a small act that can accomplish so much to heal one another.  I admit that I became frustrated with both at several points of the story.  Their tendency to jump to conclusions and dwell so much on their past experiences caused misunderstandings that couldve been avoided.  But I did love the way they worked for their relationship.

Every Love is a story about acceptance, sacrifice, hope, and love.  It is a story about finding that one person whose constant friendship and acceptance allows us to shed all those chains that hold us down and tie us to the past, preventing us from moving forward in our lives.  The story is engaging and holds your attention from the first lines.  I was faced with so many emotions while reading, yet every emotion was welcomed.

Dirty Red is an intense, dark, honest look into the mind of Leah. So many people hate this character but I, in contrast, love her. Leah is real, and raw and gritty. She is the most honest liar I have ever heard of. She might possibly be the devil walking around in the flesh of a beautiful red head. My heart actually went out to her. She has never known true love her entire life which has turned her into a hollow tortured soul.

Watching Caleb and Leahs story play out was like watching a train wreck in slow motion. You slowly saw the wreckage fly off piece by piece and in the end all you have left is a pile of rubble that once resembled a life.

I am extremely excited to see where Tarryn takes the story in Thief. I will be starting it right away!",2,"[-1.0481398952412384, -1.3698497431978152, -0.9155293092840906, -1.0342151239733255, -0.7452827871706058]",-0.7452827871706058
2919,"This deep haven novel is not a light & fluffy story but deep, realistic drama. I will be honest at first I couldn't really dig in to this one. Most likely because I was in the mood for something more humorous and breezy ... You know when you've had a rough few days you want to escape into something light & happy. This however was a story I am so glad I didn't set aside... In the end this was exactly what I needed to read. Warren speaks to some deeper truths & reminds us to trust God. Trust in God's goodness, His love, His faithfulness.

The Shadow of Your Smile is a story of people coping but not really living... They struggle through but have to learn many things like forgiveness (to others & yourself), love, commitment, and most importantly the lesson of letting go and trusting God.

What started out as ugh turned into something beautiful in the end. Isn't that what God does with our lives when we give them to Him... He brings beauty from ashes.",3,"[-1.1401175502471625, -1.1377933336550936, -0.7459074445469799, -1.0420047120644491, -1.049105185304203]",-0.7459074445469799

I am truly grateful for this generosity. I really appreciate the time, effort and expense it takes to make a reviewer copy available to me.

Keeper of the Stars by Robin Lee Hatcher is a beautiful, bittersweet love story.  Brad wanted to worship God by making music, so when the opportunity came to audition and become part of Trevors band, he jumped at the chance to live his dream despite his sisters reservations.  Now Brad is gone and Penny is angry, but Trevor made a promise to Brad as the young man died in his arms and he plans to keep that promise even if Penny never forgives him for her brothers death.

Keeper of the Stars is a beautiful book about forgiveness and finding the path home to Christ.  Its about love and family and friends and celebration and honesty.  And theres a sweet romance that develops within its pages.  This is one of those books that makes me want to be a better person and use my giftings for what God intends.

1537,"New York knows Nathaniel West as the brilliant and handsome CEO of West Industries, but Abby knows he's more: a sexy and skilled dominant who is looking for a new submissive. Yearning to experience a world of pleasure beyond her simple life as a librarian, Abby offers herself to Nathaniel, to fulfill her most hidden desires.

After only one weekend with the Master, Abby knows she needs more, and fully submits to Nathaniel's terms. But despite the pleasure he takes in Abby's willing spirit, the Nathaniel hidden behind the rules remains cold and distant.

As Abby falls deeper into his tantalizing world of power and passion, she fears that Nathaniel's heart may be beyond her reach--and that her own might be beyond saving...

Review:

Let me say that first of all that for 90% of the book Nathaniel made me just want to smack him around. I found absolutely no redeeming qualities for him. To consider him a Dom is just wrong, he is a prick using his will against Abby, I saw nothing of what a true Dom would do for his submissive.

Abby and the supporting characters are what made the book for me. In the beginning of the book Abby has the whole ""I have been crushing on this guy forever thing"" going on and getting stepped on by Nathaniel. Thank goodness she makes a stand. At least Abby finally gets smart and tells him to get lost that she deserves more. I kept rooting Abby and hoped she would get what she wants.

Technically this book is well written and interesting (even with Nathaniel acting like a prick). I am not sure all this fan fiction crying out is about on Goodreads, but I did enjoy the book and will read the second book. Is this my favorite book? No, but it entertained me.

723,"Tenley and Birdie in many ways are versions of each other in another era. At least at their core. When it comes to love. When it comes to their mothers. Connected through time via one man, a host of novels and a writing desk, Birdie and Tenley have a story for all of us. And then of course there is Elijah. And Jonas. Two men, separated by time and about as opposite from one another as can be. Yet they too are connected through the women they love  and through the men of integrity that they are. Rare in Elijahs time. Rare in our own.

Two stories. Two women. Connected by time and separated by it, all at once. Tenleys wit and adorableness (in spite of her searching heart) endears readers immediately, and Jonas ability to wit right back seals the deal. Her growth through the story is skillfully and gently penned, the simplicity of grace vibrant against the backdrop of faith. The Writing Desk is fun, tender, heartwarming, and inspiring. All wrapped up in a captivating story that youll want to hug when finished reading. (Dont ask me how I know this.) One of Haucks best, and thats a high standard to meet since everything she writes is exquisite. This one will be on my favorites list for years to come!

1870,"Liam: I know she hates me. I hate me. I ruined her life.

Liam: Never found one second to call and explain to her what I had done to us. She was my best friend and I let her slip through my fingers just to save myself from the heartache of hearing she didn't want me anymore.
I had dreams too.
And my dreams included her, but she would never have gone for it. I'm not living her American Dream. I'm living my own.
My decision destroyed everything.

This is a sweet story about the one you left behind, second chances, life changing surprises, making your own choices, and following your heart.

Liam and Josie were high school sweethearts and planned to be together forever. They were inseparable from their friends Mason and Katelyn. But one decision and subsequent communication issues changed it all. He is now a rich and famous rock star, but empty.

Liam: This is me coping with my mistakes and failures. I may be successful when I'm on stage, but at night I'm alone.
And so freaking scared of dying alone.

Ten years later, he is going back home to Beaumont to bury his best friend, Mason. He has to come face to face with the girl he loved and left. And face Mason's death and be there for his friend's family.

You can feel the love between Liam and Josie even when they know they should keep their distance. They cannot just start again where they left off. But they cannot ignore their feelings either. Their gradual reconnection and slow merging of their lives was heartwarming.

Liam: I watched for you and once I saw you, I knew I was going to end up chasing my girl, waiting for you to run around and see...the real me and love me for who I am and not what I did to you.
I'm standing in front of you, Josie. You just have to turn around.""

Liam: ""I love you, JoJo. You're forever my girl.""

7384,"I would hope that anyone who invests in a smartphone of any type would purchase a protective case for it.  I bought a temporary case for my new iPhone 6 while shopping around for one that offers extra protection from drops and other accidents.  While my temporary case did a wonderful job for the few days I had it on my iPhone, I have to admit that this Urban Armor Gear case provides the higher amount of protection I want (and probably need).  The case offers military-grade shock protection without adding extra bulk and remains very light in weight.

Here are what I consider the pros and cons of the case for me:

Pros

- the case has ""skid pads"" on the corners which add shock protection (this also adds minutely to the overall size of the case, but my iPhone still fits in my pocket with the case on)

- the case was drop tested to military standards, validating that it is very sturdy and impact resistant

 - the extra protection helps with my fears of dropping the case since I have arthritis in my hands

 - another feature helps me to grip the iPhone very securely -  it has ridges on both sides at about 1/3 and 2/3 the way up

- there is no problem with the camera or the flash - it provides a glare-free flash - and the lens seems better protected to me than with other cases

- the case fits securely and the openings are all in the right places

- all the buttons work well and with easy access with the case on

- the case comes with an HD screen protector and small cleaning cloth

Cons

- the rugged look is not what I would call feminine, but the added protection is better for me than having a more feminine design

I am glad I shopped around for a case that offered me the extra protection I wanted.  If you need a sturdy, impact resistant case, I would recommend this case to you.

The author, James L. Swanson, writes in a very easy going colloquial style. In fact, there are times in the text where the writing seems a little too simplistic, but those are just fleeting moments. Mr. Swanson is very good at creating moments of tension and high drama. This is all the more remarkable because the story he is telling is so well known. The moment of Lincolns assassination and Booths death in the Garrett barn are two of the best examples of these kinds of moments in a text filled with such scenes.
This text is well researched and documented (extensive bibliography and Notes sections). I read a lot on the Civil War and have for years and there were many many things about the assassination and its aftermath that I had never come across before. I love when that happens!
Manhunt is as accessible and thorough an account of Abraham Lincolns assassination as is currently available and I highly recommend it.

Actually it was my least favorite subject in school, but Kathi writes in a way that make history come alive.  The rest of the story was good also though the Harriet Tubman parts where, in my opinion, sometimes too far apart.  I think I would have liked Mazie's story more if I could have related to her more, but sadly I could not.  This is a wonderful book, at times frustrating at sometimes beautiful.  In the end Kathi wrapped up with the message that I so desired to come out in the story.  The past does not define you unless you let it, your ancestors are not you.  Lean on God for He sent His Son so that the past no longer matters.  Let Him set you free.
I compliment Kathi on her writing and making history as exciting, inspiring, and interesting as it should be written.  I must also compliment (I think) New Hope publishing.  The format of the book is something I've never seen before and I LOVE it!

4.5 stars
M/F Thriller Romance
Triggers: Gang affiliation, Stalking, attempted murder, rape
I was given this book for an honest review by Wicked Reads.

Bailey is hiding in plain sight. She knows that she needs to keep her brother safe from her old gang, the Inca Boyz. Joel is her younger brother and she knew that Donovan was trying to groom Joel to become like him. When her past comes back to stalk her, can she trust someone whom she's just met?

Then you have Nathan. He is somewhat insecure about himself and despite his awesomeness with numbers, he doesn't believe that Bailey would even give him a second look. However, when fate steps in and places her right in his path, he can't help but be attracted and sweet.

These two have a relationship that anyone would envy. Nathan is patient while Bailey figures out her own feelings. He is great with Joel and instills great wisdom in him.

The Ace Security family wraps around Bailey and Joel so tight that she can't help but believe that she and Joel will survive Donovan's release.

2940,"Four years ago, Susan Gregory launched ""The Daniel Fast"" blog because others were curious about how to have a successful fasting experience.  Later, she put all of her information into a book and recently an expanded version has been published which includes the book, recipes and a 21-day devotional.

""The Daniel Fast"" is based on the diet in the book of Daniel and is an experience for your whole person:  body, soul and spirit.  According to Gregory, ""sometimes you are so hungry, the only way to be fed is to fast.""  The one thing that Gregory is adamant about is that fasting is always about food.  The very definition is ""to restrict food for a spiritual purpose.""  The Daniel Fast is a partial fast in which certain foods are restricted.  It has become a very popular form of fasting and is based on Jewish fasting principles.

If you are hungry for more of God in your life and want to discover the discipline of fasting, Gregory's book will show you the steps and provide recipes for you to try.  It is exhaustive and informative and will help you through your 21-day journey.  Having all of the information you need in one place will help you succeed and encounter God in a new and amazing way.

But now that she is shunned and the witches' council is after her, it's a truth that cannot be ignored.  The council kidnaps Rachel in retaliation for her dealings with demons.  Some just want her imprisoned; some want her stripped of her magic; and some want to steal her eggs to make more witches who can kindle demon magic.  Fortunately, Rachel still has Al's summoning name and makes it back home to mount her defense.

Rachel's ties to Al are closer than ever. In fact, it looks like our resident demon is developing quite a fondness for her.  And while I don't think Rachel considers him a BFF, the tide may be turning on how she thinks about him too.  The whole teacher-student thing is giving them something of a bond.

Pierce is back and moving with great swiftness into the boyfriend category.  We still get some reminders of Kisten (and they still tug on my heartstrings) but Rachel seems to be ready to move on. Of course, as our hearts begin to mend from his wrenching death, Kim Harrison is standing by, ready to crush us again with another beloved character death.  It's not a big surprise, but it packs a big emotional punch.

All of this happens as Rachel struggles to come to terms with what she is. A demon? A witch? It really doesn't matter, as she looks inside herself and starts to judge right and wrongs without the labels and preconceptions she's had all her life.

Reading how the boys came to be separated from their families to have a chance to live and fight for freedom is amazing. You can't help but think of today's times and the disrespect that people have for the United States. Way back as people migrated to the United States, they learned English and came to love this new world as their new home and were wiling to fight for their country.

Reading and soaking all of this rich history in kept me captivated by all of these brave young men. How Werner and other men were separated from their units and found each other to form a new unit, being captured and rescued and the knowledge of many men losing their lives.

I have always been a Warner fan, sorry Adam lovers, but there is just something about him that caught my attention right away. I always knew there is much more to him than meets the eye and Destroy Me proves me correct. It was so interesting to get inside Warner's head and finally begin to understand him.

Warner is damaged, and I think that is putting it lightly. There are numerous reasons he is the way he is and I am not going to list them all now. However, we also learn that Warner is not your normal bad guy and that deep down he really isn't all bad. Certain actions prove he does have a heart and he does know the difference between right and wrong. It also becomes clear that Warner is not happy with his life, but he also sees no way out of it. The happiest he has ever been was when Juliette was there and it crushed him to learn that her getting happier was not a result of him, but of Adam.

Destroy Me was the perfect lead in to Unravel Me. It gives the reader some perspective and really sets them up for the sequel.

Damien is a tattooed, closed off, angry, and utterly gorgeous artist. He is also Chelsea's new neighbor. He can't deny his attraction her, but he can't allow himself to have her....
Chelsea is initially annoyed by her new neighbor and his noisy, barking beasts. It doesn't take long to realize she is actually attracted to him, but quickly gets thrown into the 'friend zone'.
Both characters have valid reasons to protect their hearts, but eventually, the walls that have been built are broken down and this duo is simply magical.
This story is filled with laughter, high emotions, sexual tension, and heartwarming moments.
Neighbor Dearest is a standalone with a beautiful and perfectly written HEA.

A nursing school student, she is denied re-entry into the program because of her father's guilt and jail sentence for his mercy killings. Upon hearing from her nephew that her elderly sister is dying, an older friend of Becca's recommends her as caregiver. Becca changes her identity and a journey leads her halfway across the country to a life far from the past that haunts her. Her compassionate nature and sensitivity brighten the Hughes household as she finds ways to bring comfort and cheer to the elderly Mrs. Hughes during her last days, lifting the responsibility from her son who owns a successful real estate agency.

All My Belongings is a beautifully descriptive, inspirational novel penned with compassion, elegance and passion. Cynthia Ruchti displays tremendous insight once again in this emotionally charged, intensely sensitive narrative of family dynamics, death and dying and starting over. The development of Becca's faith life is beautifully illustrated throughout the details in the relationships in this novel. Acceptance and forgiveness are strong elements that come to fruition in this inspiring story. The topics of mercy killing, adoption, deception and grief are blended with elements of humor, romance and beauty. I highly recommend this deeply moving story of life, death and new beginnings.

She's ready to return to her school and her friends in London, but it takes some prompting to convince her family. It does help that her therapist has announced it the best road to recovery for Rory - returning to the scene of the incident, that is. Turns out this return has been manipulated by the Shades. See, the Ripper destroyed their last terminus and the division is in danger of being shut down unless they can come up with something quick. After all, what good is a ghost busting cop if he can't bust ghosts? Fortunately for them, Rory has somehow managed to become a terminus herself. With just a touch, she can banish a ghost to wherever it is they go. And her return couldn't have come soon enough. Something weird is happening in London once again and Rory might be the only one who can stop it.

I think it's safe to say that THE MADNESS UNDERNEATH has been at the top of a lot of Must Have lists for 2013, mine included! I adored THE NAME OF THE STAR. Rory is smart and sarcastic and the combination of mystery/thriller elements and paranormal is one that I always love - when done well. And Johnson definitely does it well. Plus, Johnson's writing style is light without becoming overly frothy. Snarktastically snarky, to be honest: just the right blend of smart ass humor and social observation (extra wonderful in a boarding school setting and via a Louisiana girl, too!).

Strangely, while THE MADNESS UNDERNEATH delivered on all counts, the end felt a little flat. It's clear there's more to the story but this felt very much more To Be Continued... than the end of THE NAME OF THE STAR. Ah, well. I guess it'll be another year before we find out what happens to ... and with the whole ... and if Rory will be able to ...

Jacob admits that the intensity of the scenes with Vivienne does form a strong bond between them, but she shouldnt confuse this with falling in love.  Jacob needs to re-assert his domination in the playroom, and with no boundaries to their passion Viviennes vulnerability awakens emotion in Jacob.  An idyllic trip to Tuscany sees a business trip that develops into a vacation.  Jacob enjoys the charms of Tuscany and the Italian people, but more so when sharing these with Vivienne;  even he admits it has been a romantic trip, memorable in every way.  After such a romantic week, Vivienne doesnt believe Jacob can deny what is between them, but he looks lost and sad when he tells Vivienne there is more she doesnt know about him - concerning his mother - even so Viviennes words of consolation go unheeded.  There are so many other twists and turns in this instalment that encompass Viviennes birthday surprise; how happy Vivienne is that Lana and Trace are an item;  the ongoing investigation re Daniel, and Jacobs confrontation with Sam;  Milos previous offensive behaviour becoming more sinister;  The charity for Care For The Child that Vivienne and Jacob attend where Vivienne meets Jacobs sister and is mildly curious about Jacobs brother Micah;  the business developments with Sensual Scents and Vees Scents, everything that makes this an extremely riveting read, and which I certainly would have no hesitation in recommending.

I love this book. It is perfect for me. A couple people said there is too much drawing and not enough journaling. Well, for someone like me -its perfect. I am not a ""journaler"". I can't ever think of anything to write and usually don't have the time. I always start out with good intentions... but after a few pages (literally) I give up, forget about it, and never open the journal again.

So if you have thought about starting a prayer or praise journal but are not really a writer or just don't have a lot of time - like me, this book will be great for you! It has gorgeous pictures/drawings that you can color as much or as little as you want. And there is just enough open ended thoughts and questions to get you thinking and writing a few words. AND - its fun!!!!
What I like to do is color in a few small spots then use that same color to write a few words. So I end up with a pretty picture and pretty colorful writing!

This would also be a great gift idea for a teen! So get one for yourself or a daughter or granddaughter, or that other special person in your life that you can never think of what to get them!

1326,"In Sheila Connolly's latest County Cork Mystery, Scandal in Skibereen, we're heading back to the little sleepy town of Leap in Ireland. Maura is getting used to life in Leap, running the pub she inherited and starting to build a life for herself. When an American stranger comes to town, she stirs up the locals with her rudeness, as she tries to find a lost painting. However when the body of a local, simple-minded gardener is discovered, all fingers seem to point to the American, Althea, and Maura steps in to help uncover the truth.

The County Cork Mysteries became my favourite new mystery series of 2013 and I'm happy to see that Sheila Connolly continues the trend in 2014 with the latest book. I loved all the history and intrigue surrounding a lost Van Dyck painting, that Althea, Maura and several locals are trying to find. Along the way we discover a little more about Maura's history in Leap, including the fact that her Gran used to work at the manor where the painting is discovered.

With my own Irish heritage, I find the County Cork mysteries fascinating and I love how much flavour of Ireland that Sheila Connolly has wrapped into the pages. She writes with such Irish flair that it's hard to believe that Sheila isn't from Ireland!

Scandal in Skibereen kept me on the edge of my seat, as Maura and Althea hunt for the painting and try to find a killer together. It was a great second book in this series, and readers of this series will fall head over heels for this small town of Leap all over again.

2064,"A WINTER WEDDING was wonderful! Brenda Novak's entire Whiskey Creek series is a must-read for me.  Love this group of friends in the small community Novak has created.  Kyle is one of the last to remain single. He gave his heart a long time ago to Olivia, but she loves and is married to his step-brother Brandon all because of a mistake he made with her sister Noelle. But now Kyle finally gets his story, finds love in the most unexpected person and can be free of Noelle. In the previous books he is such a great guy, always there for his friends, successful in his business, but heartbroken.

Lourdes, a successful and well-known country music star needs a quiet out of the way place to regroup and write her next album. She rents Kyle's cottage, but when the heat doesn't work, she moves in with him temporarily.  She's had some heartbreak of her own and finds peace with the handsome, kind and giving man. These two find their selves attracted to one another, despite their belief their hearts belong to someone else.

Novak writes a beautiful story of unexpected love and healing hearts.  If you are a Whiskey Creek fan you'll enjoy the usual humorous yet supportive interaction among the tight group of friends. I've been waiting for Kyle's story and this one did not disappoint! 4.5 stars.

The author shows in marvellous detail how things which can survive and adapt to changes or damage are those which will survive the longest.  Adapt and survive.  But it isn't as simple as that as might be expected from a book of over five hundred pages including the index, bibliography and copies notes and appendices.

The author writes in an engaging and down to earth style which helps to make the subject matter comprehensible even when he is dealing with complex issues.  It is the sort of book which will repay more than one reading in my opinion.

Each chapter relates a separate relationship, organized chronologically by the death of the other party. I couldn't pick a favorite chapter, though his brutal takedown of Lee Strasberg will stay with me for a while.

Apple has been adding functionality lately, including live TV from many sources (fox, abc, espn, and others all the time). With airplay, you can easily output almost any screen or content from any Apple device including iPhone, iPad, and any Mac computer.

They are more and more integrating all
With multiple AppleTV's and multiple Airport Expresses, we can wirelessly play music to every single room in the house. If you already have iPhones, iPads, and Apple Computers, then you really should have an AppleTV on every TV in the house to let you totally free your media.

I'm a huge J Lynn / Jennifer Armentrout fan. This book was fabulous. The snark, the sizzling character chemistry, butt kicking characters, and the banter I always love with her characters is very much apart of this book. For being the first book that she wrote, this book definitely set a great standard for all the other books that were written after it. YES, with the other books all the elements I mentioned above that I love have only gotten better.

Lily is a character I loved. She's tough, holds her own, and isn't afraid to stand her ground or kick some demon butt. Lily is a layered character whom I enjoyed getting to know as her story goes on, and little by little I got to see what really made her the character she is. That friction between her and Julian is HOT! Like really hot. I love the way Julian ruffles Lily's feathers. He knows how to get under her skin. At first I wasn't sure what to really think about him. It's evident these two have some history together. That history just makes things all the more sizzling, and interesting. Julian and Lily have an undeniable attraction to each other, and boy do things heat up between the two of them. Especially in the bedroom.

The twist in this book is awesome. I did not see it coming, and yeah, it's a killer of a twist, considering it's a character I liked too. I have to give huge props for Jennifer for driving the dagger in on that one. The action in this book is just as awesome as the action is in all of Jennifer's books. She doesn't shy away from letting her characters do their thing, as well as getting banged up a bit in the process. I just hope Jennifer writes another book in this sequel.

8864,"""You are supposed to be my perfect ending, but I'm just your beginning""

Tattooed Scars is the much anticipated sequel to Tattooed Emotions by Alicia Rae. We were left with that delicious ending that had most readers panting for more of Raelyn and Damien.

My heart broke for Raelyn, just as when she just found her great love and she was finally living her life to the fullest  she receives the most tragic news. She was torn between her options. If she were single, she knew what shed choose, but she has Damien now. And Im just so glad hes there for her when she needed him most.

I think I fell in love even more with Damien. I love how he took care of Raelyn and how he tries to fight for her, even when shes in the brink of giving up. You know its true love when he/she stays at the lowest point in your life and doesnt give up even if you push him/her away. Damien did just that, and because of it  he has my heart.

This time, we are gifted with Damiens POV, even if its just for a few chapters. We get to see what is inside his head. His thoughts, his worries and it were enough for us to know how much he values Raelyn.

Just like the first one, the steam wasn't lacking, it got even hotter and sexier. The love was just overflowing as much as the heartache. Nevertheless, this novel gives a lot of hope that anything and everything is possible, especially when you don't give up.

Im looking forward for the next book in the series, perhaps its the happy ending the two of them very much deserved.

7053,"I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review for Stephanie's Book Reports.

Infraction is the second book in the K.I. Lynn's Breach Series. You need to read Breach or you will not understand at all what is going on in Infraction.

Waking up in the hospital is a surprise to Lila as she doesn't remember the terrible crash that happened to put her there. She has a long road to recover and Nathan is determined to be there front and center and take care of her. He also makes a life changing declaration to her and she is not sure what to make of it. She either has to chose to forgive him and see where they can go together as a couple or push him out of her life forever. If she lets him back in and Nathan hurts her again she knows there is no way she would ever be able to survive. Nathan his hiding the secrets he hasn't revealed to anyone about the life he use to live. Those secrets are revealed to Lila and just like the scars they both now carry they have to heal. But, can they heal together or are they better off on their own.

I want to say that I firmly even in Breach believe that Nathan and Lila belong together. Here is the decision moment. In Infraction all cards are laid on the table and with the help of a therapist and family friend Nathan and Lila must decide if they can make a life together. Are they better off alone or are they better off together? I always felt like these two were healing each other from the beginning of their story. However they were not going about it in a healthy way that was ever going to not end with one or the other of them shattered all to pieces. This is not a fast book to read as you go through a lot of therapy with these two characters and at times it about drove me nuts. It got a little come one get on with the story please, at times to me. However when it took off it took off and I was shocked at what happened. I also was excited to know that I had Breached on my kindle to dive straight into as there is no way the story of these two characters was through.

I'd fallen off the wagon with my workouts so we decided to start working out together with this DVD and WOW! What a HUGE difference! I liked the JM yoga workout but it was tough and intense and at a quicker pace (which I easily adapted to, but it probably wasn't best since I'd never tried yoga before) but this DVD is PERFECT! Bob is super friendly, encouraging and there's even a tiny bit of meditation at the end which I didn't think I'd like but I've come to look forward to! It's the perfect way to end this workout! I'm only on Weeks 1-2, but I like that even after you finish the six week program there is a maintenance workout so that takes most if not all the guesswork out of the whole exercise bit for me! The moves aren't difficult and he gives you several options if you need to work into it.

Marian Keyes' latest Walsh sister's novel is ""The Mystery of Mercy Close"" and it revolves around down-on-her-luck Dublin Private Investigator, Helen Walsh. The mystery is about the disappearance of a semi-famous singer who is part of an aging ""boy band"" trying to have a reunion tour.

The plot and the mystery are engaging and entertaining, but what is most compelling about this novel is Helen's descriptions of her past bout with clinical depression, and her looming dread that she is sinking into another abyss. Marian Keyes herself has suffered debilitating depression so I'm certain that these vivid descriptions and details are very authentic; they are heartbreaking to read. By letting her readers into this dark world of depression, Keyes generously shares her affliction while doing a service for the many who suffer this way by putting into words what they are feeling.

It included themes of unwavering love, family, and friendship.... the effects of that war has on a person.... and universal messages that encouraged those in need to seek help, get answers, and overcome.

Xander and Willow have been best friends since childhood and inseparable ever since. That this, until, Xander enlists in the army and cuts off all contact with Willow and everyone. Now three years later, and with the request from her mother and Xander's mother as a last resort, Willow is ready to have answers. What happened to her best friend? Why is he so detached, so hollow, so angry and bitter of a shell of man that she once knew? And does he reciprocate what's always been in her her heart?

As for Xander, the man with the world upon his shoulders. His world is black, haunted by the screams of his comrades, the musk of their blood, grime, and deaths. He's a man plagued with the evergoing question of why him but not them? He thinks he's a man beyond saving. Beyond redemption. But what do you do when the light to your bleak and desolate world comes in the form of the girl that has always been embedded deep within your heart and soul? Will she be what sheds him of his demons and saves him from destruction and himself? Or is he well past salvaging?

Over all, a great book debut with a tad bit abrupt ending.*sorry!* I think what I liked most was the simple complexity of the novel and that it centers on Willow and Xander rebuilding and reconnecting and coping with Xander's current condition.

Miranda is a teen leading a fairly normal life, her parents are divorced, her Dad's remarried and is expecting a baby, her Mom is raising Miranda and her two brothers, Jonny and Matt.  Miranda dreams of a boyfriend and ice skating.  Suddenly the biggest news is the comet that's going to collide with the moon.  Instead of this being an exciting event it turns devastating.  The comet hit the moon hard enough to push it closer to earth.  Now disasters are happening all over the world and some continents have disappeared.  Miranda and her family are safe due to being so far inland, however, that's about to change.  As the world goes into panic, grocery stores are emptied, gas skyrockets, people began planning for the end of days.

This was a page turner; you'll follow Miranda's life and feel her fear.  When her friends either leave or die its very moving.  Her desperation to live is passed onto the reader.  Watching what is happening to her family and what they have to do to survive is very moving.  Through out this book the reader feels the sadness as if you were there living the story.  I was moved to tears a couple times in this book, especially the ending.  It's not what I expected and not really what I hoped but it was satisfying.  When I say scary, it's not horror, but it's close to home, this could happen and what would we do?

4806,"This was so fun to read, totally entertaining! It had some awesome laugh out loud moments and I loved the humor. It was just so fun to read!

I enjoyed the story of Marley and Porter coming together, learning their history and watching their friendship and relationship grow. There was a nice build happening between the two. I liked the bits of animosity and verbal sparring as well. There was a nice amount of chemistry and heat too really bringing them together.

I liked the secondary characters a lot. I thought her dad was spectacular. The family dynamic the McManns have is awesome and I loved that sibling rivalry she has going on with her brother. The bickering and comebacks between the two were great. I loved the familys story of why they were taking the trip on the Mother Road and how special it was to all of them. There were so many little things I enjoyed that made it a great story.

The humor, yes it totally made me laugh, but it could be juvenile, potty mouth type of humor but it totally spoke to the 12 year old in me. Some of it was a bit over the top but I just went with it and kept chuckling all the way through. There were some really touching moments woven in and I think it helped to balance it out a bit.

I loved the storyline. I liked the details and character development though I did think some parts where a drawn out. It was the overall storyline line and laugh out loud moments that sold me though.

Totally amusing, enjoyable read with a great romance mixed in. :-)",4,"[-3.650595238218901, -2.4477781778321317, -0.8354101873326423, -1.0292422866089128, -1.0079419420354392]",-0.8354101873326423
5367,"What an amazing read by Winter Renshaw about second chances with love, heartache, heartbreak, sorrow, friendship and soul mates. River is a recluse and keeps to himself after a tragedy and Leighton goes back to her family home on the pretence that she can stay there. When she is conned and meets River at the house she has no where to go and their first meeting is not so pleasant. But when River spots her sleeping in her car, he helps her and says she can stay until she gets her last pay check so she can leave. As their relationship progresses a secret long ago buried comes to light which could tear them apart forever just as they both realize they love each other.
A beautiful story of two people given the chance to love again, to heal and to look forward to a future with happiness and forgiveness along with an ending that left me misty eyed.....highly recommended.

7059,"Be prepared to sob at least once in this emotional novel. But also be prepared to smile, giggle and of course SWOON  as well as having your faith challenged and reaffirmed.

The Memory of You by Catherine West is powerful and compelling. It wrestles with issues like mental illness, PTSD, family conflict, the crippling effects of guilt and the spiraling damage of drug abuse. Yet at the same time, the heaviness of these topics is perfectly counterbalanced with the sweetness of reignited romance, well-timed wit and genuine affection. Tying all of these threads together is a clear picture of authentic faith  the highs and the lows, the doubts, the clarity, and the sweetness of grace.

Natalie and Tanners romance gently builds from a childhood friendship and from shared adult-sized pain. Tanner is just plain yummy despite his flaws, and Natalie really is his ideal match. This is not to say that their road to happily-ever-after is smooth and uncomplicated. Quite the contrary. Both bring as much emotional baggage to the table as a Hollywood socialite brings luggage on vacation, and neither especially trusts the other when first reconnected. But as their friendship rebuilds, old attractions once again ignite and readers are advised to keep a fan handy for the kisses that eventually follow!

Bottom Line: The Memory of You doesnt shy away from the pain of life. But neither does it shy away from the audacity of grace. The combination of the two makes for a riveting read that sinks deep into the heart and swirls up truth in the soul. The main characters are vivid and layered, and the secondary characters are complex and delightful. This story is sweet and healing and provides the best of both worlds  authentic struggles against a backdrop of redemption and restoration. Have a tissue box (for the ugly-crying) and a fan (for the swooning) close at hand.

Jack has learned that he also has a sister and her soul was sold too. Since she is the only family he has left, Jack is determined to help her. But first he has to figure out who she.

As Jack tried to find her and the devil that will own her soul, he keeps coming across the warning that she is going to hell. It also seems someone doesn't want him to find her; everyone that he talks to seems to end up dead. With the help of his secretary Jenny, eventually Jack finds his sister. But when he learns more about her, the real question becomes does she deserve to be saved.

This is the second book in the Nightingale series. I didn't realize that so I admit I was a little lost. Once I figured out what was going on, I got into the book. This is a dark noir story that I couldn't put down. I will say that Jack did get annoying with his cigarette obsession and how everyone he talks to seem to kill themselves before they can be helpful. But I did love the twist ending with the demon Proserpine.

Although a dark thriller, I think this is a really good book to read. I am definitely going to get the first book and the next one when it comes out. This has also peaked my interest in reading Stephen Leather's other books.

732,"In Bernard Cornwell's second installment of The Warlord Chronicles, he continues where he left off in The Winter King: Arthur has defeated the armies of Powys and Siluria, while the kings, Gorfyddyd and Gundleus, are dead, and with an alliance between the Brythonic kingdoms now near at hand, he turns to confronting their common enemy, the Saxons.

Derfel continues the telling of his tale, where he is ordered to Powys to arrange a marriage between Lancelot, a man he despises, and the beautiful Ceinwyn, who he has completely fallen in love with, though he does not tell Arthur of this.  The mighty warrior soon arrives in Powys with the beautiful Guenevere and his full entourage to enjoy the grand wedding and all seems to be going according to plan.  Meanwhile, Merlin knows of Derfel's love and offers him an ultimatum.  The magician is in search of one of the sacred thirteen treasures of the island of Britain, a powerful cauldron that supposedly has the power to bring the dead back to life.  If Derfel will join him on this quest, he will make sure Ceinwyn is his.  He is given an enchanted pig's bone which, if he breaks it, will release the magic, and Ceinwyn will belong to Derfel.  The young man must then decide what he must do, as he weighs the decisions of Arthur, his lord, with the desires and wants of his heart.

Enemy of God takes the story of Arthur in new directions, as Cornwell skillfully blends it with some Welsh mythology to make for a captivating and adventurous tale.  At the same time the Christian faith is growing in power, and Arthur must balance this fact with respect for the Druid religion, but ultimately decide what is best for Britain and its people.

Flick the switch on his tusch, squeeze his left foot and Elmo reads you a Cute Little Poem, one of 5. ""Do you want Elmo to read you ANOTHER poem?"" he then says -- Well, It took us a while to realize that Shouting ""YES!!! "" was not the way to hear another poem (LOL) but SQUEEZING his left foot IS the way to entice him to recite them, one at a (foot squeeze) time. His diction is FLAWLESS. He also makes cute and pertinent comments about each poem, which is delightful to adult and child. Kids can recite the poem(s) with him. (if you don't want to hear another poem Elmo apologetically says ""OK Maybe Later, Bye Bye!""

The book he is holding has drawings on it that illustrate the poems -- ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"", ""Humpty Dumpty"", ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"". ""The Itsy Bitsy Spider"", and Hickory Dickory Dock"". All of this is CUUUTE. So is Nursery Rhyme Elmo. Cute, with floppy little fuzzy legs, but not totally cuddly as his inner workings and his mouth are made of Hard Stuff and he has a hard butt -- so, carrying him around would be fun for a kid, but I doubt close-cuddling would be very enticing.

I enjoyed getting into Demetri's head, because after reading Tear I really put him into the selfish, brat classification. It was nice watching his growth as an individual as well as the leadership role he took on. The romance between Alyssa and Demetri is very sweet, pure, and at times difficult. Alyssa deals with a lot of baggage that competes with her ability to fully commit to any type of relationship with Demetri.

We find that Vi has made quite the name for herself and we're not quite sure what Corbin does, but I can tell just from his actions at the beginning of the book, that Vi is still at the forefront of his thoughts. And I loved how he was always thinking about her and still wanting to take care of her even though she broke his heart in two pieces several years ago.

Vi is in the middle of researching her latest book and has made friends with an ""expert"" in a particular proclivity and low and behold who ""takes over"" her research, but the one and only Corbin! There's so much emotion in how's and why's of Corbin keeping his eye on Vi and of course his natural alpha male personality is driving that, but I think this goes along with how he's never stopped loving Vi.

As the book moves through the next several weeks, many secrets are revealed that literally broke my heart. The pain and shame that Vi has been living with all these years is astounding, but we also get to see how Corbin reacts to what really happened and let me tell you...it's all growly alpha and I loved it!

There's so much that goes on from this point in the story that kept me glued to my kindle. The story moves at the exact pace that is needed for this particular story and the connection between our H/h is as strong as ever leading me to hope for their HEA.

The quality of the copies is excellent, as is the printing, and it's easy to choose between color and black and white.

It is a bit counter-intuitive to set up. Most modern printers are plug and play, with fairly consistent ways to load paper and ink. This one takes its own path. We spent quite a bit of time with the instructions before getting it hooked up and new people have to be shown how to use it. I'm saying this not to complain, but to suggest that you give yourself a little time to master it if you're not completely comfortable with hardware. Don't give up.

The ink cartridges are readily available, it performs well with different types of paper, and it's quite sturdy.

Out of the three books in the Grayson Brothers series, Hold Me Until Forever is by far my favorite. Christina Phillips nailed the characterization  of Ella and Alex, bringing their friends to lovers relationship to life in a believable and intriguing way. I loved the build up between them  a lot. The inherent push-pull tension of the relationship combined with the fast-pacing of the book made this an enjoyable and entertaining read for me.

Alex Grayson is hot, and I loved that as much as he prided himself on control, small peeks of his vulnerability slipped through the cracks. Ella was patient with him, even as she challenged him to break through the chains that held him back.  Absolutely loved it.

If you're looking for a fantastic, well-written, fast-paced erotic romance where two longtime friends become so much more, Hold Me Until Forever is a book that won't steer you wrong.

The book starts out with Elijah Montgomery in the role of the jilted groom and Addison Potts in the role of the poor relative of the bride-to-be and Elijahs getaway ride. Elijah is Addisons dream come true, and yet she cant believe she develops an instant attraction to him.

I adored Addison, she is tough, yet vulnerable! She was truly entertaining, honest, quirky and kind-hearted. Elijah lives in the public eye, and she steps in to save him from the interference of well-wishers. She offers him a place to lay low after the public scandal of his failed marriage. Their instant kinship was absolutely delightful, she slowly becomes his safe haven. Their relationship is very domestic, tender and sweet. Their chemistry is too real to deny.

Elijah was such a great character, his sweet romantic gestures were adorable! He is an up and coming politician and a southern gentleman through and through. He is also a genuinely nice guy who has always done what was expected of him by his family.  Addison brings out the best in Elijah and I loved how he lets go when he is around her.

I found her to be the perfect heroine that fits Elijah's character really well.

5550,"Other than a devotional that was given to me several years ago, I had not read anything Towser had written. This book is deep, deeper than I am used to reading, but it was an interesting read. Towser makes a great case for we Christians needing to constantly pursue God, and it not being a one time thing that happens when we become Christians.

  The book was originally published in 1948, but is still relevant today for Christians in 2015. It is full of wisdom and quotes such as this one: Millions call themselves by His name, it is true, and pay some token homage to Him, but a simple test will show how little He is really honored among them. Let the average man be put to the proof on the question of who or what is ABOVE, and his true position will be exposed. Let him be forced into making a choice between God and money, between God and men, between God and personal ambition, God and self, God and human love, and God will take second place every time. Those other things will be exalted above. However the man may protest, the proof is in the choice he makes day after day throughout his life.

  This book is an updated version, and since I never read the original version I have no idea what was changed. It is written in modern English, but the original could have been also. It is formatted very well, and with short chapters it doesn't take long to get a chapter read, though I would recommend reading a chapter and thinking about it before going on to the next so you have time to digest what you have read.

  A couple of more quotes from the book:You can see God from anywhere if your mind is set to love and obey Him.

If we cooperate with Him in loving obedience, God will manifest Himself to us, and that manifestation will be the difference between a nominal Christian life and a life radiant with the light of His face.",0,"[-0.9737862349487695, -1.9203293284449252, -0.9186927859270881, -1.0028128329504316, -1.0068991810266525]",-0.9186927859270881

Belle meets Tanner at the hospital when his brother has an injury. Belle just happens to be Indie's best friend so when said best friend begins dating Tanner's twin, these two are forced together a lot.

I will say, I thought it was thoughtful of Tanner to not pursue Belle, being that her best friend is his future sister, only for him to find out that she doesn't do relationships either.

After a series of mishaps and stolen glances these two give in to their needs. They begin a time together that turns into the real deal. Tanner is falling and falling fast, which no one can believe, but he does a lot to show that he is in this for real.

Belle even with all her crazy seems to be able to have a few serious moments out of the hospital and have a real talk with Tanner to see that they need to work together to make this work.

1930,"City of Glass is the (original) final installment in The Mortal Instruments by Cassandra Clare and I have to say, Clare definitely knows how to end a series with a BANG!

I really enjoyed how it all ended and the details of each character's story and past was so creatively developed that you could see how Clare truly did create a world of her own. The ultimate twist of fate that Valentine created was so crazy, I definitely didn't expect it. Clare continued to hint at certain things and reveal others, which kept me engaged and fervently reading on and on until the end. Each of the characters shine in their own ways in this book, and I thoroughly enjoyed the witty and entertaining moments that Alec and Magnus created both together and separately. I can honestly say I didn't really care for Simon at first, but by the end of the series, I couldn't imagine that world without him and he turned into one of my favorites!  I also devoured the steamy and intimate scenes between Jace and Clary and I liked how their ending played out, whether for better or worse, I guess we'll see in the next book!

The final showdown with Valentine was pretty epic, and what he did/how he got to where he is now is enough for anyone to want to read this book. You get to see jut how far he was/is willing to go to fight for what he believes in, regardless of how evil or wrong others may think it is. After realizing his best-kept secret, you'll be flying through the pages to see how it all ends. Loved it!

Aly wants her dreams to come true but it seems like if she moves they will be pushed aside.

One tragedy just seems to lead into another and Jake is heading in a direction that will break everything. With this comes new doubts that they both have on whether the relationship will work or not.

Samantha has loved Fang since she was 10 years old but knew she was only ever seen as a little sister, not a woman even when she grew up.

Sam is a feisty girl happy to do whatever she wants regardless of what everyone thinks, because no one knows her real reasons for what she does.

Fang waited a long time to go after who he wanted and while he was waiting he did allot of stupid, but typical rock star crap.

The cup fits a little snuggly in the cup holder of my car, but my car is OLD, and the cup holder is not very convenient.  I was always making coffee, then had to go somewhere, and the old stainless ones I had just didn't keep the coffee hot enough to even get out of the house and into the car.  This cup holds two regular coffees with ease, and keeps it HOT.  I love the clear plastic lid so I can see the beverage coming at me, no surprises!  It has a little sliding door that will accomodate the stainless steel straw that comes with it, a s well as make it easy to sip straight from the cup without dripping.  If you knock it over it will spill, however, but the lid won't come off.
I liked it so much, I got two  more as gifts.
I have to add a note:  the lip, when using the cup without the straw (as with coffee) is too thick, making it hard to drink without dribbling.  Sad.
  I still love it just not for drinking without the straw.
Follow up:  after using this cup for several months I still love it.  HOWEVER, the stainless straw gets crooked in the little hole/slots, so I have to ""follow it around"" in able to sip.  I wish the lid had a dedicated hole in which to stick the straw, that might make it leak if it gets knocked over, but I still think it would be nice.",3,"[-1.3428975237028182, -2.212667317132547, -0.9795441626419606, -1.029216370307063, -1.0612400336085799]",-0.9795441626419606

The size and shape are perfect. I'm a girl (smile) and it fits and feels well in my hand. My sons and husband have used the mouse, so I know that it is comfortable for someone with larger hands too. It also doesn't matter if you are left or right handed (ambidextrous), both can use it. There is a tiny little device that fits securely into the USB port of your laptop or desktop computer. It allows you to connect the device to another with little or no effort.  There are several shortcut buttons to Windows (located on the top & thumb area) that I rarely use (my son does because he has a Windows 8 laptop), but I could see where they can be helpful. You even have a wheel (located on the top) that is helpful for navigating a page. I haven't had a problem with the battery (I use the sleep mode) which so far has conserved its battery life.

In this book the author recounts her experiences and emotions as her husband becomes more and more unstable. While learning along the way about mental illness and its pitfalls, she carefully documents all of the things that she now sees as red flags, in hopes that others might see those flags as well if they are experiencing similar behaviors in those they love.
Each chapter is followed by facts and / or statistics relevant to that chapter. Historically, more focus has always been on the person with the illness, as opposed to how it affects everyone around them.
Of course, that is natural, and as it should be. However, the devastating wounds inflicted on others is still something that needs to be addressed. In sharing her experiences, we learn that despite the huge numbers of people that will experience mental illness at some point in their life, stigma and denial still run deep.
