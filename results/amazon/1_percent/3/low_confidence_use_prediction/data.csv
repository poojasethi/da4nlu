7838,Absolutely beautiful rug. The colors are so pretty and I love the chocolate with the other colors. This rug is well made and the low pile means that I can actually open my french doors when it is down. Eureka! finally a rug that doesn't bunch up when opening the door. This looks like a much more expensive rug and today when my neighbors were over they fell in love with it.  It is supposed to be stain resistant which I haven't tried yet (thankfully) but it seems like it would be. The leaf design makes quite a statement but is not too big or gaudy.

Yes, there was a woman commander named Artemesia(though she was not in overall command and is best known for cutting through one of the other Persian ships, sending it to the bottom, as she fled).  And the Persians did burn Athens.  Aside from that, the movie was utter nonsense.
Then again, it is based on the gendre of ""graphic novels"", which are essentially comic books for adults who never learned to read in schools(working too hard on their self-esteem and too little on their studies?).  For this reason, I had low expectations.

5595,"You would think that Advent and Christmas would be easy times to pay more attention to our spiritual lives, but it can be the opposite. Not only are most of us very busy with holiday preparations and parties and activities, but it's easy to feel that we already know the story so well we have no new thoughts on the subject.

In six chapters, Burkhart weaves together the stories of Zechariah, Mary, Elizabeth, John, the Magi, and a shepherd with a poignant family story of his own. He connects all the threads into a series of questions.

There are five major questions:
* How will I know?
* How can this be?
* Why has this happened to me?
* What will this Child become?
* Where is the Child?

These are questions about the Christmas story. But each chapter also has questions for discussion. These questions cover many different experiences readers might be going through at Christmastime, from grief and bitterness to exciting times full of the promise of the future. Many of the questions are deep, asking how the past and the future are connected or how the challenges of justice and oppression can best be met in our lives.

But there are also personal questions, such as how are you stewarding the blessings you have in your life, and what can you do to increase your trust in God?

This book can therefore be used as a Christmas study for people at many different points in their lives.

It's a quick and easy read, too, simple and down to earth. If you like to have a personal devotional book for the holiday season, this is a handy one, and the questions might provoke some important thoughts as you prepare your New Year's goals or resolutions.",3,"[-2.309553883392249, -3.1542163741931057, -1.9108978203561797, 1.1369280043678658, -2.003086393548932]",1.1369280043678658

I finally had to portion them into small snack size zipper bags just so I would force myself to keep track of the calorie count.  A 1/4 cup serving size has 140 calories.  That doesn't sound so bad, now does it?  Well it will easily fit into your hand and the temptation is to take a handful when you (meaning I) see the bag.  Not good behavior so I had to add a discipline reminder.

The dried cranberries are plump and moist which makes them easy to chew.  The almonds are a little bit hard.  The cashews are just right both for crunch and taste.  This mixture is described as a little bit of sweet and a little bit of salty.  Yes, I definitely get the sweet in the cranberries, but overall I think there needs to be something done about the sea salt.  I can eat several bites where there doesn't seem to be much salty taste at all and then another bite will have exactly the right proportion of salt to sweet that I like.  Perhaps that is just a personal thing because I don't normally like food to be very salty but I want enough salt for it to be flavorful..

The main problem is that she is forbidden to be with a supernatural and must ""join"" with a human to try and get pregnant. Gretchen has been fighting this for years and it looks like she is running out of time and excuses.

Alek Melos is a Gryphon and one of the caretakers in Sanctuary. He is not close to many in Sanctuary but has formed a special bond with Gretchen although he knows he is forbidden to act on it.

When Rose gives Gretchen and Alek a way to be together will they agree to her terms? With their enemy Xerxes getting closer will the conflicts in Sanctuary give him a way to finally achieve his own goals of bringing Rose down?

This book was super good but so ominous. I am so freaked out with what will happen next as this one left me really wondering if Sanctuary can stop Xerxes with everything that happened.

I understood why Gretchen wanted to hold out for the man she loved but with everything that happened at the end I wonder if it was worth it all. I am hoping something super powerful comes out as a result of what happened. I was mad at her when she left Alek's place as we know how that turned out.

I really liked Alek and how he wanted to do what was right but that his heart really wanted Gretchen. He was strong and powerful but he definitely had her as his weakness.

I have two cats - one who is very particular about her treats and one who isn't. The older cat usually will only eat the Temptations brand treats that are catnip flavored. I was pleasantly surprised to see she loves these chicken and turkey flavored treats! She comes running when she hears the bag, eats the treats, and looks for more.

Our younger male cat isn't as particular about his food and predictably, he also loves the treats. The idea behind the round shape of these treats is they can be tossed so your cat can play with them. Also this cat is young and very playful, he takes his food very seriously and won't chase the treats or play with them. He sees them and immediately eats them without any playing around!

3055,"The Beck and Olson book reveals some startling facts
about the current school system in contrast to counterparts
overseas. For instance, the Finnish education system sits at
the top. The success story in Finland is attributed to hiring the
best and brightest, training them well and allowing teachers
to function unhindered by too much administrative interference.

Surprisingly, Vietnam's school children rank higher than the US in
some key areas. The Beck and Olson book has a considerable
discussion on home schooling which is a necessary part of life
in communities that are out of reach of major school districts and
population areas.

In addition, today's advanced technologies provide for a much better
outreach of technology into rural areas. Technological innovations
include the internet, more advanced language instruction like Pimsleur,
electronic books over paper copy and a plethora of educational games
too numerous to mention. Soon, the 3D Printing technologies will enter
the virtual classroom in a very big way.

The debate on teacher tenure continues to go on in many places.
Proponents argue that tenure is needed to protect the considerable
professional investment of time and money made by teachers.
Detractors argue that there is no easy way to terminate bad teachers.
There is no easy sequence of administrative steps to either keep tenure
or eliminate it.

Dr Miguel Faria argues that ""From 1950 to 1992, we have witnessed a
25 point drop in the SAT math scores and a 50 point drop in the SAT
verbal scores, and they have continued to plummet and remain at the
bottom of the barrel since that time."" At bottom, we need to address this
problem by getting children to read more quality literature and solve
more involved critical thinking problem sets in math and science. Then,
America's primary education system will return to a higher ranking when
compared to Europe, Asia and elsewhere. America's considerable
university system and its professions are still the envy of the world.

For the time being, the Common Core is still in an evolving state.
And so, it's too early to judge the efficacy of the effort since the new
standards are in an early stage of development. Clearly, the effort
to increase formal schooling from 13 to 14 years via Pre-Kindergarten
will expose children to language acquisition and application at an
earlier age.",3,"[-1.018273386908243, -2.5660159460745606, -1.8156423133854818, 1.1354522658151405, -2.085469686808471]",1.1354522658151405

From the gorgeous wood earpieces to the brightly colored woven cord covered wires, these look very stylish. However, any audiophile knows when it comes to sound, stylish looks don't mean anything - the sound is what matters. With these lovely headphones - sound is not sacrificed for beauty in any way!

Much thought appears to have been given when these headphones were designed. The wood give a full rich sound and when it comes to deep base, I swear I can feel these move just a bit when those tones are hit. The cording gives extra protection and strength to the wires. Where the wires attach to the plugs, merge into one wire (or split into two) as well as at the jack, there is a rubber reinforcement at these stress points. The jack comes out of your device at a 45 degree angle which is different than any other set of phones that I have. They also come with extra pairs of silicone ear bud covers so that you can find the ones that fit your ears well. These make the headphones extremely comfortable as well as cancels out the noise for a peaceful listening experience. One thing I'll note though, it appears these are not soundless to others around you. According to family, they can hear a little bleed-through when I'm listening to them. Also included is a nice pull-string linen bag to store everything in.

As Cheri, she gives a dazzling performance of 'Black Magic', and it's great listening to her in her hillbilly accent. The final scenes where her face take up the entire screen was great directing and she looked as beautiful as an angel. Her comic timing was delivered perfectly, and the costumes she wore in this movie lead to some of her greatest still photograph.
So why only 4 stars? The rest of the cast did a great job, Virg, Elma, Grace, and Carl. Who did I leave out? That's right, Bo. Don Murray single-handedly ruins this movie. His cowboy mannerisms are waaaay over the top, he overacts every scene he's in, he's rude, stupid, and to tell you the truth, Marilyn ending up with him is so unbelievable, it makes you just want to scratch your head.

Kidnapping a woman (with a lasso of all things) and dragging her on the bus is a stretch, but when Bo finally gets his butt kicked by Carl, and learns a lesson in humility, and then Marilyn falls for him, well...

7343,"Robert Smith and The Cure are one of the most influential bands of the post classic rock era IMO. Not in that super obvious way like Zep or Sabbath (and not to that caliber either), but it is there. The single melody song builds, the mysterious tones and arrangements, the dark pop overtones...simply brilliant. From Tool to the Surfers to Artic Monkeys, plenty of bands pay homage to the Cure in one way or another. This album marked, for me at least, their last gasp of greatness before entering into what i consider to be something of a musical decline. Fascination Street (rumored to be about Jack the Ripper) in particular will go down as one of the all time greatest songs recorded. Anyway, i am uncertain if i can hear a difference with the remastering or not, since i don't have anything to compare it with, but this is a great album, and if you aren't already familiar with it, you owe yourself a listen.

""Greatest Hits"" (19 tracks, 76 min.) thankfully is not worried about representing all phases of CSN's long career. It focuses on what the title implies: the greatest hits, nothing more, nothing less. As a consequence, you will find no songs from the more recent albums, in fact there is no music on here that is any more recent than 1982's ""Daylight Again"" album. The highlights are many. All but 3 tracks of the classic debut album are on here, as is about half of the ""CSN"" album. Even better, 3 non-Neil Young tracks from ""Deja Vu"" are on here. (To those wondering why ""Woodstock"" is not on here, Neil made it pretty much his song--courtesy of the blistering guitar solo, even though he didn't write the song.) The 1982 songs have aged surprisingly well: ""Daylight Again"", ""Southern Cross"" and ""Wasted on the Way"" are very easy on the ears. The remastered sound is outstanding.

I have tried every bread knife and slicing guide on the market. Most work fine. (The Mercer bread knife on Amazon  is the best.). It wasn't the knives or the guides, it was ME. I couldn't slice evenly no matter what I did. One end thick, the other thin, you know what I'm talking about right?

When this slicer arrived I had 3 loaves waiting. One was a no knead loaf with a very crunchy, crusty exterior, another a very soft Challah egg bread, and the third, ciabatta rolls.  I had to experiment, of course, to get the right thickness for me. I found that the 12 & 1/2  notch area on the dial made  about a 1/2"" slice and was just right.

The loaves were a bit too big for the pronged pusher at first, so I very carefully sliced off the first three pieces before using it to hold the breads in place. Yes, it's much better to follow the rules and cut the loaf in half to use with the pusher, but well, I was anxious to see how it worked. Talk about impressive! The loaves were sliced into PERFECTLY EVEN slices in a matter of seconds!  Yes, SECONDS!  I knew at that moment that I should not have hesitated getting this slicer.

I got over my thinking that I'll only use this for bread, and I  tried a yam that I had on hand. Wow, yam chips in an instant. I raided the vegetable bin and sliced cabbage, a russet potato, and an onion. I was a slicing fool. I wasn't looking forward to the clean up but it turned out to be less of a bother than I thought.

I am not a scientist, and when a friend tells me so and so is a great doctor, I translate that to myself to mean my friend likes his/her doctor.  How do we judge?  Clearly, 50% of all doctors graduated in the bottom half of their medical schools.  Not that that, in and of itself is a necessary determinant of whether or not someone is a good physician.  But what is?
Dr. Gawande uses many anecdotes to show how the nascent science of improving performance amongst medical professionals is the key to longer, healthier lives.
Gawande asks hard questions of his profession, as well as of himself: if he's an average surgeon, should he be trusted with someone's life, or their child's life?  Shouldn't we have a right to know how our doctors rate, when there are objective standards that can be applied to performance?
Fairview Children's Hospital in Missouri treats patients with Cystic Fibrosis.  The patients who are seen at that hospital, consistently outlive patients seen at other hospitals who have the same condition.
Gawande argues that data, such as that, should be readily available both to patients and their families, so they can make informed choices about their care, but also for doctors so they can improve their own performance.

You know when you read a book by Wright that you are reading more than an in-depth magazine article, a syndrome that strikes so many so-called ""books"" these days. With Wright you are going on an extended voyage through a whole variety of issues. I have read a few other books on Scientology, including what I consider another great read, Bare-Faced Messiah, difficult to find, and a book by Hubbard's ex-Scientology son, also difficult to find. Both books, particularly the former, describe the criminal aspects of the Scientology enterprise. Wright's book seems to shy away from that, possibly due to the litigous threat of Scientology. But most irksome to me was Wright's penchant (starting on page 1) of calling scientology a ""religion."" Scientology, despite the appelation, is certainly not a ""religion"" and was only considered a ""religion"" starting a few years ago, after agreement from the government under Clinton to extend that tax shelter. Wright makes no mention of the ""fact"" (if it is one) that during his movie role in Primary Colors John Travolta (Scientologist) met with Clinton and the two engaged in a deal - if Travolta put a positive spin on his role as president Clinton would agree to enact a bill making Scientology a ""religion."" In fact this bill was passed while Clinton was president. Why? But Wright (almost on every page) goes to great length to call Scientology a ""religion"" until one's antennae go up: is he doing this to avoid litigation? Why cast doubt on so many of Scientology's other insane actions and not on this? Wright's attack would have been more hard-hitting and convincing if he concluded that Scientology is what it is - a cult.",3,"[-3.1396608942615556, -3.075586283452976, -1.4326432710099626, 1.127378073369321, -2.7603929460467116]",1.127378073369321

9345,"Last night's late night movie was the ""Gods and Generals"" DVD. It was an interesting reenactment of a part of the American Civil War. My feeling was that to really appreciate and enjoy the movie, you'd have to be deeply immersed in knowledge of the war and it's participants. It would seem essential, and then the movie might become ever better. I have little such knowledge. To me it was amazing and educational to view with it's cast of thousands and all the historical sites and such. The costuming was interesting and well done. The acting seemed somewhat stiff and wooden and many of the conversations were given like little mini-speeches expected to be heard by all. The stances often looked like something you'd see in paintings exhibited for patriotic reasons. There seemed to be much too great of an emphasis on God and religion, but then I don't know what the feelings and beliefs were at that time.

The American Civil War is always listed very high on any tabulation of casualties and casualty rates. Well, if the reenactments of these battles are at all accurate, you can certainly see why the casualty rates were so high. The lines and groups of people standing and firing into other lines and groups of people who are returning the fire would certainly lend itself to high casualty rates. Good grief, war is dumb in general, but certainly it couldn't have been this dumb. What was the purpose, just to kill as many people as possible? Other things seemed seriously off. In some instances, generals were giving speeches and instructions to hundreds of men scattered about areas of perhaps 5 acres without any PA systems or without shouting. Gosh. I wonder if the movie directors have ever tried to speak to a group of people outside. Well, pick, pick, pick. The movie lends itself to this kind of petty criticism. Actually, I rather enjoyed seeing it, but the movie seemed ultra long and became somewhat tedious. I think if you're really interested in the Civil War, you'd want to have this DVD in your library.

9850,"There are several things I like about the Perfect Fitness Resistance Band kit.  I like the included mesh storage bag, it's easier and neater to store the bands.  I do like the option of looping the handles onto the bands as opposed to each band having it's own handles.  I like that the 10 lb and 15 lb bands can be combined for 25 lb.  I really like the included door attachment!  I wasn't sure at first but it was easy to use and increased the number of exercises you are able to do.  I did not see any damage to my door after using it for several days.  I'm tall so I had no problems putting the door attachment at the top of the door, if you are short I'm sure you will. It took me a bit to get used to having so much 'handle' on the bands- it's approximately 20"" on each side of the webbed band attached to the rubber band, then you add the handle section with it's own length of webbing... this makes the resistance band a total of 80"" long, with 40"" being rubber and 40"" being that flat webbed ribbon ( not sure what it's called) and the handle.  Even though I'm tall, I found that I had to widen my stance when securing the band with my feet in order to get enough resistance.  I didn't feel as though I was truly getting 10 or 15  lb resistance.
The other set of bands I have is by Giam.  The total length of those bands is 56"" including the handles - 24"" shorter than these bands. I feel the resistance much more on those bands.  I had a friend try these, she's about 5'6"" and these were too long for her to get an effective workout.  When we set up the door stopper she was halfway across the room before getting resistance.  I do like them, I feel they are more suited to a taller person.

We have one kitty who has a reaction to corn and corn meal - it makes him itchy.

When this arrived, there was the usual excitement over a new bag that looked like it was for them.
There was initial curiosity, and a few cautious nibbles, and that was it. No other interest at all.
So, I tried putting this in their rolling treat ball. They usually will eat almost anything when they had to smack the ball around to get something out.  Our girl cat will go for a bite or two, but our boy won't touch it.

Not sure if they are actually the same facility using different dba's or not, but I don't buy Purina dry foods because of their grain and junk fillers. I'm a little suspicious though about the purity of this food.

After that Catherine was regent to 10 year old King Charles IX.Catherines goal was to keep the Valois monarchy intact no matter what or whom stood in her way. There were also daughters whom Catherine made sure had advantageous marriages.
This novel spans the life of Catherine from 1527 to her death at the age of 69 in 1589. Catherine had many enemies some of which were the Guise family. Catherine supposedly dabbled in the occult and consulted with Nostridamus on a few occasions, asking him to tell her about the future.
I had never read anything much about France and it's rulers and I found this book to be so well researched and told in ""Catherine de'Medici's words"" that it was so easy to read and hard to put down. I think Mr. Gortner put a very humane spin to a time where there was so much upheaval pertaining to religions and the persecutions that followed and all the power struggles that were taking place in this time period. I think the author did a remarkable job telling a story about a historical figure and female no less with compassion and made her very real to the reader...I enjoyed this novel very much and look forward to more from this talented author.",3,"[-1.1269864766720594, -2.1955394806511905, -1.82450481248551, 1.1262818708748366, -2.6786385508863173]",1.1262818708748366

This may not sound like it should be a problem, but if you're a fan of the novels you know that there is much emphasis on the beauty of her green eyes.  This was very important to me, as I'm sure it is to others.  Why they couldn't give the actress a pair of colored lenses is beyond my understanding.

There is simply no comparasion to Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable, to try and do so would be impossible.  If you watch the movie without trying to compare everything to GWTW, you might just enjoy yourself.

When I needed to reset an alarm a few weeks later, I again needed the manual but now I no longer need the manual.  This is not a clock for people who like things simple - it will drive you crazy.

I bought it partly because I wanted a large, dimmable display with 2 alarms & a clock radio.  The dimmable display is excellent.  You can turn it completely off if you choose.  I keep mine at the lowest dim setting so I can see the time in the night without being kept awake by a bright display.

The clock radio alarm is very good BUT it only stays on for 30 minutes so if you are like me & want your radio to keep going while you are getting dressed, you will either have to turn the radio on again or use the second alarm to come on 31 minutes after the first goes off.  My last clock radio stayed on for 2 hours which I prefer.

The buttons are very small & black so they blend in to the top which is a bit inconvenient.  The snooze is a large button & placed in the center which is good.

He's been caught unprepared by two renegade Demons who have been attacking Nightwalkers and Lycanthropes, and the renegades' human necromancers and grievously injured.  He's saved before he can be killed by Siena, the Lycanthrope Queen.  While he's being nursed back to health, sparks fly between him and Siena.  This means trouble for both of them since lying with Lycanthropes is against one of the Demon Laws and because during the centuries-long war between the Demons and Lycanthropes (spurred on by Siena's crazy father and with a fragile peace just brought about by Siena), Elijah was one of the great slayers of Lycanthropes, earning the hatred of many of Siena's people.  Also, Lycanthrope Queens can mate only once and that is forever, and Siena does not want to mate with any man who may threaten her crown.

The attacks of the renegade Demons create a bit of suspense while Elijah and Siena (mostly Siena) try to sort out their relationship.  I liked most of the roadblocks to their relationship, since they seemed reasonable enough, and different, at least.  Elijah was interesting because he's obviously a great fighter and worthy enough to partner with a very strong Queen, but doesn't have any alpha-male hang-ups about being with a powerful woman.

3018,"I wasn't sure what I was going to get with this book, but I've been really surprised and have had a hard time putting it down each day. The author makes sure to point out that the stories aren't about what crazy people are doing, but what God does through (sometimes) crazy people or situations. It shows how God can redeem a sinful person or act for His purposes.

For example, the story of Lot and his daughters. I hadn't thought before that they may have assumed that God destroyed the world, seeing as they witnessed the destruction of their town. They thought they were all that was left and had to rebuild the population (yuk). But God used that and has descendants of these acts in the lineage of Jesus.

Another example is the story of Elijah and the bear. Seems harsh that a man of God would call out a bear to maul people who were mocking him. Seems harsh that God would allow it. The point in the book is that God used this example to show that He requires proper respect for the people doing His work.

There are 30 ""crazy"" stories in all and some are just to point out that God exists and God cares and God wants us to be near to and rely on Him. He wants total obedience. He uses people and there are no perfect people.",3,"[-2.430293917650083, -2.365934857773751, -1.7149464618778216, 1.1232562213228308, -2.540174792269292]",1.1232562213228308

7651,"I was hesitant about selecting this cheese. 6 pounds in one can seems liked too much. However, I had people coming over to my place and thought it would be perfect to test.

When I opened the can, I scooped out what I needed which was almost a  of the can. With the remaining, I opted to place the leftovers in zip lock bags; I used 8, and freezed them. I then plan to boil them later and cut the corner to serve them. Opening it I placed the cheese on a low heat on the stove. If you cook it too high, it does burn quickly, you just need to warm it up. Once warm, I made some nachos and drizzled the cheese over them. They covered the corn chips well and did not make them soggy. I made a decent size platter of them. I also cut some broccoli stems and usually serve them with ranch but opted to dip them in the cheese instead. I had five people over and they all ate the cheese with the dishes I served and loved it.

Mind you, I like bland flavors. If something is too spicy, I am probably not going to be a fan. This is very mild though and you might have to dress it up. I found even adding a little chili powder to the cheese for the nachos added a perfect flavor.

I love potatoes and plan to add the cheese to baked potatoes and also country fried potatoes. The possibilities with the cheese are endless.

Be prepared at how big the container is. Someone said the size of paint can, I have to agree. Mine was wrapped really well though and did not have a dent.

It takes a really good story and some clever writing for a PG film to appeal to adults as much as it does to kids, and it's virtually impossible to do this while still keeping the PG rating intact, but somehow the writers of Hoodwinked have accomplished this twice! The story really isn't important, it's geared toward kids and is very simple and predictable. What's not easy is keeping the adults awake, while the kids have the time of their lives. The writers accomplished this by throwing in parodies of classic adult films. Hoodwinked Too! has references to Goodfella, Die Hard, Silence of The Lambs, and a half a dozen other classic films, and it was those scenes that were the most fun. Also interesting to note, the voice of the wolf was done by Patrick Warburton, who does the voice of Joe Swanson on Family Guy, and it was really difficult for me to see the wolf as a totally different character. Hoodwinked and now it's sequel are nothing like Toy Story and aren't going to blow anyone away, but they are pretty good and while the kids are watching it, you'll find yourself getting in a few laughs as well.

It was quite heavy, but my UPS man had the worst of it, carrying it in from the truck. I was able to get it in my living room without much difficulty. This mattress is for my guest bedroom up a flight of stairs. I took the rolled up mattress out of the cardboard box and was able to cart it up the stairs with assistance from a teenaged neighbor. We put the mattress on the bed, the correct side up, and let it unfurl. It took a couple of days for the mattress to regain its full shape. I opened a window for an hour to allow the smell to dissipate.

The mattress is made of stretch knit with a fleur de lie design. I waited a few more days before I made the bed with sheets and top quilt. My son came for the weekend, and he slept on the mattress. His report is that it is very comfortable, with good support. He prefers a queen size bed, but this full mattress will be perfect for most people. There is a 12"" profile memory foam and innerspring mattress. It feels good to the touch. There is also a cool gel layer. The pocketed coils prevents motion and movement being noticed by a partner. Getting in and out of bed will not awaken your partner, unless they are a light sleeper.

The ease of set up was impressive for me. I have always had people deliver the mattress, and set it up. I will give the other mattress away and list it on my city's list serve. Comfort and support are the most important aspects of any mattress, and this one fits the bill.

5528,"Amelia Rhodes Pray A to Z is a handy little resource for anyone who is new to a personal prayer time and/or is overwhelmed by the length of their prayer list. Its divided into five topics per letter, making it easily accessible no matter how you choose to incorporate it into your life. Petition (asking) topics range from adoption to grieving to infertility to ugly thoughts and even to trafficking and homelessness and incarceration. Each letter also includes praise topics which focus mostly on names of God, such as Burden-Bearer, Keeper of my Soul, and Prince of Peace. These all  petitions and praises  start with a related Bible verse then move to some guided prayer prompts and end with an example prayer. My only real complaint is that the praise topics don't come first in each letters section, but that is minor in the overall scheme of things.

Bottom Line: Pray A to Z makes a nice addition to anyones spiritual arsenal and, considering the time of year were in, would be a great gift for new believers and prayer warriors alike. Use it in your personal prayer time or as a family or small group  or all of the above! The aesthetics of the book are so well done, too. Worthy Inspired Publishers do such a fantastic job with cover design and little touches inside and out that make their books special to own.  Pray A to Z isn't meant to be a book of prayers that you recite mindlessly, but as a stepping stone to deepen your prayer life and cover your community in grace. The possibilities are endless!

Anyone with cats knows that they tend to throw up on occasion - they have to get those pesky hairballs up somehow. Anyway, we had reached a point where each of our two cats started to throw up every day and it was making our lives quite a bit busier because of the cleanup involved. The cats acted fine, but we were overworked with cleaning up pet messes.

After we decided it was time for a change, I did what I usually do - research the customer reviews to see what people had to say about the Blue Buffalo cat food (there are tons of varieties. I landed on this food and found that most reviews were really positive, with one actually saying his cats stopped throwing up all the time. That got me hook, line and sinker.

So, I'm here to report the same for my cats. We are now on our second bag of this variety of Blue Buffalo cat food (sensitive stomach). Amazingly, the throwing up stopped, except for the occassional hair ball incidents. I can't believe the positive effect this food has had for my cats. They are shiny, healthy looking, and best of all, they aren't throwing up everywhere anymore.

She spreads it on the dough, with no other sauce, and tops it with prosciutto; then when it comes out of the oven sprinkle chopped arugula over the top - delicious and easy home made pizza.

There are many other uses for the Kirkland Chopped Garlic - toss it in a stew or soup, saut it with fresh spinach, put a dab in an omelette, add it to fresh home-made tomato sauce/pizza sauce. It works well in any cooked dishes; however for un-cooked dishes which require fresh garlic, I still do it the old fashioned way.

9253,"""The Incredible Journey"" is a wonderful book based on a true story of three animals surviving a long trek together against the odds.  It was made into a wonderful movie by Disney studios where the film is mostly narrated with some dialogue between the people involved.

Later another version was made where the animals ""talk"".  I've only seen clips of this version, and, maybe for some it is entertaining, but for me it takes away from the touching nature of this story.  By having the animals ""talk"", it makes it more of a charicature of the story and takes away from the seriousness of the plight of these animals.

I was hoping that the original would be put out on DVD eventually, and it was!  This is a timeless classic; a real family movie.  Of course, kids younger than six or so may not have the attention span for it - these Disney movies were never intended for toddlers; when they were made, movies were only seen in theaters and children under school age weren't taken to theaters.

THE GOOD:

It works very well to push large amounts of snow off cleanly-- even did a better job than my usual brush, with much less effort.

THE BAD:

The locking mechanism and connection to the ""broom."" My hands were very cold, which made it hard to screw on the foam ""broom"" to the handle, but I got it. Then I tried to pull out the telescoping handle, and couldn't. I had to step on the foam and pull up on the handle. That worked. However, it wouldn't stay locked in the ""out"" position. While I was pushing the snow around, the handle kept retracting. That would be pain enough, but here's what was worse:

The handle ALSO kept unscrewing from the foam. The foam was actually spinning around in the wind. I couldn't get it to stay securely on, even though I tightened it as far as it would go. The slightest movement made it loosen and start unscrewing again.

So, in short, I'll still keep it handy because even with the annoyances, it got the job done faster than with a brush and scraper and with less worry about scratching my car, but if I were looking for a snow broom, I'd try a different model first.",3,"[-0.03757267747216275, -1.8492113746076422, -1.597949514057955, 1.117553625016817, -2.878630919877145]",1.117553625016817

I'd fallen off the wagon with my workouts so we decided to start working out together with this DVD and WOW! What a HUGE difference! I liked the JM yoga workout but it was tough and intense and at a quicker pace (which I easily adapted to, but it probably wasn't best since I'd never tried yoga before) but this DVD is PERFECT! Bob is super friendly, encouraging and there's even a tiny bit of meditation at the end which I didn't think I'd like but I've come to look forward to! It's the perfect way to end this workout!

After the incredible In a Silent Way from a year earlier, Davis continues his experimentation with avant-garde and fusion, but this time with a bolder and darker sound that really contrasts his work from In a Silent Way. Perhaps the most noteworthy aspect of this recording is its spontaneity; basically, the band more or less picked up their respective instruments and started playing. It's this unusual approach which makes Bitches Brew stand out. While listening, one can quickly conclude that the band was doing a long and spontaneous jam session, as some sounds don't mesh 100%. Still, this recording maintains a certain charm and appeal, despite its rawness. I'm not a jazz expert (especially with knowledge of song structures), but can safely say that Bitches Brew is loose, and purely meant to be transitional and trailblazing. Miles' trumpet is exceptionally loud on this one, and can really dominate at times.

It pours well, and the carafe comes out of the fully enclosed base unit without a catch, unlike my Melitta which catches at the bottom each time. It is a nice looking unit as well.
The krups comes with a gold basket for brewing without a paper filter. With the Mr. Coffee the nylon filter is optional.
There are beeps with this unit when brewing is done and the clock window is lighted.
Of the three coffee makers that I have, I used the same coffee, R O water, the same amount of water and coffee, used a paper filter and the same grind, all three made good coffee. I really couldn't tell the difference in the three. The exception was when I put the Mr. Coffee on the strong setting, which I feel is a gimmick, the coffee was not stronger, just very bitter. If you desire stronger coffee use more beans. I felt the Krups was the easiest to use and was the simplest.
 I don't make coffee using a timer since I like to grind the coffee fresh, so I didn't test the timer. After reading the timer instructions over, it appeared straight forward to use. The Krups uses the no. 4 filter which I have always preferred.

A few years ago, they changed to a thinner material, more microfiber-like and those towels are very similar to these. These DII towels and my newer turbie twists are very similar in feel and in the amount of water they hold. The main difference appears to be that my turbie twists don't have a button for looping the elastic around to keep in place, which I admit, it a nice touch from the DII towels. Like my newer turbie twists, I find that I need to use two towels after a shower, because I often soak through the first even if I wring my hair out.

7864,"Good things:

The big handles make it easier to hold and push down to cut through fruits and vegetables. I've had a cheaper apple corer-slicer that was really hard to push though the apple because the handles weren't big enough to really get a grip on it.

The interchangeable blades give you two options without having to buy two separate cutters.

It works...mostly.

Bad things:

The blades are slightly recessed in the ring, which means that it doesn't cut cleanly all the way down to the cutting board. With the apple corer/slicer, it's not a huge deal because you can just pull the cutter  up off the apple and pull the slices apart. But, with the vegetable blade, the potato slices remain stuck in the blade. The easiest and safest way to deal with this that I could figure out was to take my measuring cup and push the bottom of the potato up into the blade so the blade cut all the way through. I still had to pull the slices out the top, but it was more manageable that way. Still kind of a pain, though.

These blades are sharp. Really sharp. You cannot handle this gadget casually. You have to be careful and on your guard every time you handle it. My Mom cut herself twice in the space of two days - once washing it and once putting it in the cupboard. The second time was a pretty significant cut. There has to be a way to design something like this to reduce the likelihood of cutting yourself.

Other comments:

Perhaps I'm just not sufficiently coordinated, but I had to cut the end off the potato to get a flat end to make it stand up so I could slice it without tipping (possibly my fear of getting my fingers too close to the blades was affecting my slicing technique).

In case I haven't yet made this point clear, the blades on this cutter are really sharp and very easy to cut yourself on. Honestly, I was ready to throw it in the trash after the second time my Mom cut herself. I'm storing it in a plastic container so no one reaches in the cupboard and accidentally touches the blades.",3,"[-1.3864655025363515, -2.3213669932680987, -1.7109589159259435, 1.114471083334282, -2.404014544302261]",1.114471083334282

Our son enjoys this toy (even without sound and water cannons) and spends a good deal of time playing with it. He loves the action figure for Jake, who can be fastened to various parts of the ship. The wheels on the bottom of the toy allow him to push it around our living room floor.

9701,"There are 2 main components of this system: the transmitter and the dog collar. The transmitter emits a radio signal that's picked up by a receiver in the collar. Whenever your pet goes too far, the collar device first produces some warning sounds, then administers the dog an electric shock. The intensity can be controlled, on a scale of 1 to 6. You also get a bunch of flags that are supposed to be visual clues for the dog during training.

I titled this review 'reliable' because we've had one of these transmitters for about 4-5 years and, after we plugged the transmitter in and set the range to the 'max', never had to revisit it. As for collars, we started with one, for one dog. We had to replace it after a couple of years because it stopped working. Since then, we bought 1 more because we have 2 dogs now.

To make it short, on our 2 puppies, we had no need to study the manual, plant little flags or any other training clues. Our training lasted about 30 minutes. As soon as they got zapped a couple of times and learned to associate the warning tone with 'run toward the house', they were fully trained. End of story.

My issue problem with this system is the range. Yes, I know, that I can buy 2 transmitters and therefore extend the range a bit but, at these prices, I can't afford to do this. All I wanted was to be able to extend the range from the current about 70-80 feet all around to maybe a 120 feet radius around the transmitter. Somehow, I think this should be quite possible.

Oh, the new collars require the somewhat expensive but a lot easier to install PetSafe batteries.

7368,"Radiohead famously self-released its 7th studio album in October, 2007 via a name-the-price-yourself digital download, and now almost 3 months later comes the actual physical CD release. The way Radiohead went about this (one of the biggest bands in the world forgoing the major label structure completely) made as much news, if not more so, than the music itself. So hoes does the music actually stack up?

""In Rainbows"" (10 tracks, 43 min.) starts off with ""15 Step"", which for about a minute makes you think you're listening to more of Thom Yorke's brillian solo album ""The Eraser"", but then electric guitar crashes in, reminding you this is the full band. A bone-crushing ""Bodysnatchers"" follows, then giving way to ""Nude"", which is reminiscent of ""How to Disappear Completely"" from Kid A. ""All I Need"" caps off a very strong first half of the album. On the second half, the band turns more introvertly, quieter, check out ""Faust Arp"" with a beautiful acoustic guitar intro. ""Reckoner"" again reminds me of ""The Eraser"" sound. The album ends in a great 1-2 punch, the uptempo ""Jigsaw Falling Into place"" and the piano-driven ballad ""Videotape"".

In all, ""In Rainbows"" is a return to the more traditional (if there is such a thing) Radiohead. Indeed, since the release of ""OK Computer"", the band has taken a number of sideroads: the brilliant experimental ""Kid A"" and its baffling and underwhelming companion album ""Amnesiac"", followed by the unfocused and sprawling ""Hail to the Thief"" have finally lead to ""In Rainbows"". I saw Radiohead headline Bonnaroo in June 2006, where they played several of the ""In Rainbows"" tracks. This album is further proof (to the extent that was still necessary) that Radiohead is one of the most important rock bands out there these days.

""Scream"" jump started the horror movie genre in the 1990's. Without ""Scream"" we woudn't have flicks like ""I Know Whay You Did Last Summer"" or ""Urban Legend"". Without ""Scream"" we might not have ""Inside"" or ""Martyrs"". Sure ""Scream"" ushered in the 90's version of slasher flickes, but it also ushered in an era of self referential horror films. Wes Craven was able to poke fun of the genre he helped create....and the ""Scream"" audience was in on the joke.

So many horror films since ""Scream"" have come to rely on the horror converntions set forth in ""Scream"" that it actually feels original.

""Scream"" is meant to be fun, the cast, and the soundtrack both indicate that this is a fun film, not to be taken too seriously. If you've seen ""Terror Train"" or ""Prom Night"" or ""Hell Night"" than you are the target audience for ""Scream"", as an homage to 80's horror, you won't find a better film.

At first, I also thought it was great -- she wasn't able to destroy it like she had destroyed so many other toys. (Durability is a very important quality for me when it comes to dog toys.)

However, over time, as my dog chewed on the toy, little slivers started to raise up from the surface. This actually made it a bit painful to pick up. And when my dog wanted me to toss it or tug on it with her, I had to refuse because I didn't want my hands to get all scraped up, which earned me some big, sad, brown, puppy dog eyes.

At any rate, I let my dog continue to chew on it because she seemed to enjoy it. Until one day, a couple of weeks ago, I looked at it and found that it was covered with blood. Best I can tell, the slivers/rough spots cut up my dog's gums a bit. She doesn't seem to have suffered any lasting damage, but I took this away from her and I'm not going to give it back, nor am I going to buy her another one.

I'm mystified, honestly -- I have one of the white Nylabone bones, and my dog chews that equally as much, but it doesn't cut up her gums and make her bleed.

Nevertheless, Transformers was a very pleasant surprise, considering how other classics took a serious beating in the re-make (e.g. The Incredible Hulk, The Dukes of Hazzard, and Superman to name a few).
The film re-introduces the Autobots and Decepticons to the new generations now that the level of technology allows it.
The movie combines action, adventure and comedy, thus resurrecting interest in the Transformers after a long dormant period.
Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox and Rachael Taylor (both of whom are GORGEOUS!), Glenn Moreshower (from 24!), Michael O'Neill, Jon Voight, Bernie Mac, Kevin Dunn, and the rest of the cast have outdone themselves with their performances (the chemistry is AMAZING!), which are outstanding to say the least, making this movie one that can be watched over and over again!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!

The title track, 'Hotel California' is one of the best songs of all time, and it has one of the top 10 guitar solos of all time as well. Hotel also has one of the greatest lyrics of all time, ""You may check out, but you can never leave!"" I mean how awesome is that!?!? 'New Kid In Town' is one of my favorite Eagles songs, so that also helps the album be one of the best. 'Life In The Fast lane' was the first Eagles song I ever heard and I sill think it has one of the est guitar riffs I have ever heard in my life! 'Wasted Time' is alright, its the only song Im not extremly fond of. 'Victim Of Love' is my favorite song off of Hotel California I just love the feel to it and the whole sound and tone of it. 'Pretty Little Maids All In A Row' and 'Try And Love Again' are both great ballads. 'The Last Resort' is a really good song and the perfect one to finish off the album.
Hotel California would be a five star album if it were not for 'Wasted time' being such a bad song. But you may like it and that may only be my openion but who knows. All I don know is this is a great album and if you don't have it buy now you need to get it.",3,"[-4.0994364260276335, -4.5152587070498775, -2.3748789336991214, 1.1057805951782234, -1.155029009099498]",1.1057805951782234

I am truly grateful for this generosity. I really appreciate the time, effort and expense it takes to make a reviewer copy available to me.

Jonathan Falwell's ""1000 Days: The Ministry of Christ"" is a fascinating look at Jesus' three-year ministry that puts His service into perspective for me from the title through to the final page!  Each of the 15 short but deep and thoughtful chapters has thought-provoking questions for personal reflection and/or small group discussion.

This section includes memorization challenges, prayer suggestions and practical ways to put what you are learning into action as well as offering suggestions for further study on each topic.

This is a lovely, whole leaf tea with bits of lemon in it.  It's really more like black tea flavored with lemon (there's not a bergamot taste -- fine by me, because I don't care for regular Earl Grey).  There's no powdery residue and all the pieces/ingredients are large and identifiable.  I like to brew this in a clear glass teapot so I can see the color developing (it's a deep golden brown, just as any black tea should be).

I drink this hot, without sweetener, although it would also work iced/sweetened. Recommended especially for people who enjoy flavored black teas.  (Also, if you're not sold on other Earl Greys, this one might still work for you.)

1911,"A difficult book to read and significantly more difficult to review.  The difficult part of reading and reviewing was the struggle to suppress my own emotions.  The writers attempt to reveal the mistreatment of Muslim women in particular is noble.  Her life story is one of many emotions, trials and tribulations and the efforts on her part to seek equality on behalf of others reveals a great mind in a great person.  It should be fair to say there are many more like her stymied by their religion and background and yet of equal mind if not courage.  I say this because no single ethnic group or religious sect has a monopoly on brains regardless of gender.  Many people are simply what they are taught to be.  To avoid offending anyone I seldom discuss or give thoughts on religion.  I am not knowledgeable enough to discuss the various aspects of the various religions but like many (I suspect) I entertain my own thoughts and opinions.  While this book taught me some about the particular religion involved it made light of the brutality of life for women living under the justification by that particular religion.  I despise anyone involved in the mistreatment of women.  Certainly in my life I have known bar flies who maybe rated a dope slap but the constant abuse and mistreatment of any woman rates as a punishable sin.  I cannot always say they are the fairer sex unless by fairness one means their attitude and treatment of others, male or female.  I have known, worked with, and worked for some women who I am proud and privileged to have known, worked for and worked with.

Each AppleTV is connected to the sound system attached to the TV via the optical cable. This is a nice addition by Apple because we don't need to turn the TV on to play sound, a very nice feature.

Apple has been adding functionality lately, including live TV from many sources (fox, abc, espn, and others all the time). With airplay, you can easily output almost any screen or content from any Apple device including iPhone, iPad, and any Mac computer.

With multiple AppleTV's and multiple Airport Expresses, we can wirelessly play music to every single room in the house. If you already have iPhones, iPads, and Apple Computers, then you really should have an AppleTV on every TV in the house to let you totally free your media.

If you don't have apple products, you will find the AppleTV will be of limited benefit over the competing products (Roku, Chromecast, or Amazon's Fire TV). However, if you have Apple products, there really are very few reasons you should consider one of those over the AppleTV.

Others lament an occasionally strident tone.  Some are reduced to ad hominem attacks that only reinforce the main point of the author's argument:  the religious are irrational.  I read this marvelous work about atheism with something approaching amazement.

The God Delusion is proof positive of just how sublime a rational, educated mind can be.  It is a work that champions discovery and curiosity. It applauds humanity at its best: when we use the very faculties that distinguish us from other species.  Whether discussing biology and evolution or remarking upon the dazzling possibilities of quantum theory Dawkins is better then interesting.  He is honest, moral and ethical.  It's inspiring.  A living, breathing, thinking example of how much individuals can accomplish when they put their faith in themselves and science.

With humor and pugnacity, intelligence and disdain, Dawkins takes on the God Squad, and doesn't flinch.  Is he always fair? No, but are you?  Is he usually?  Absolutely.  And that's more than most.  It is certainly more than his critics. For me, the most endearing thing about Dawkins is not his intellect (though it's impressive); or his morals (equally admirable).  His ability to make the smug squirm, the certain question and the pompous sputter is magnificent.

Read The God Delusion.  Love it.  Hate it.  But think about it.  Come to your own, independent conclusions. Use the brain that Evolution gave you. That is what Richard Dawkins would encourage you to do.

The concept is a winner in our household where my daughter absolutely loves Battleship and all the kids (and adults) are huge Star Wars fans.

This should have been a homerun. How could you go wrong with Star Wars and Battleship?

Well, the implementation is cheap and pretty poorly thought through:
1. The starships sit above the peg holders. This makes it so that it is really hard to put the pegs in place. We are always knocking over the ships. It's pretty frustrating
2. Many Battleship games include two separate boards so that each player can sit it on his/her lap. In this one there is only one game board, so you have to actually work hard not to accidentally see the other player's ships.
3. The stickers to apply to the board are difficult to apply correctly. Forcing us to put these on just adds to the ""cheap"" feeling.

This game could have been awesome. Surely Hasbro has figured out how to perfect Battleship through the years. I've played versions of Battleship that are very well done. In comparison, this version is frustrating to play and feels cheap. The only reason I'm not giving it two stars is because Star Wars is so cool.

7634,"My wife and I got a breadmaker for Christmas and were very excited to get some bread mixes to try out.  I'm a health nut, and this seemed like the healthiest mix I could find.  So, just pour in the wet ingredients, then the dry, then hit the ""whole wheat"" setting on the breadmaker (1.5 pound loaf), and 3:45 later, fresh whole wheat bread!

I use this bread every day for my sandwiches. Just slice some in the morning (I store it in a large Ziploc bag), and several hours later I'm eating a super fresh sandwich. Even though the bread is a ""honey wheat"", I taste no honey in it, and it's definitely NOT sweet. This is a good thing, as I wouldn't want sweet bread to use for sandwiches.

The bread keeps very well in a ziploc bag for roughly 10 days. It may not rise as much as some other wheat breads you buy in the store, but it's still adequate for sandwiches and very tasty. I tried the whole grain white bread, and it rose twice as high as the wheat, making it impossible for me to fit into a bag!

The only complaint I've had is the way Amazon has played with the price. When I got it the loaves cost roughly one dollar, and now they're close to three dollars. So if you get lucky, it can be very economical to use this instead of buying commercial, processed bread. But if the price stays where it's at, it makes it much more challenging to decide which way you want to go, unfortunately.",3,"[-0.470548860638875, -0.4470239772514337, -1.3330539562785964, 1.0996002523605488, -3.17338403495761]",1.0996002523605488

I switched to sheets from rolls a few years ago when Costo switched to a substandard supplier, and have been well pleased--I was always cutting the sheets the wrong size, or tearing a corner, or struggling while they rolled up on me. My go-to sheets are these commercial ones (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C7KU4V6)--cheap, flat (not folded), and excellent even in long roast a very hot oven or a moderate trip under the broiler. But some people might not have a kitchen with enough storage space for the giant box of 1000 (size of a half sheet pan, but 5"" thick), or may not need parchment enough to ever use 1000 (I use them a LOT and still have almost half a box 2 years in). In that case, I'd highly recommend these over rolls.

While not as convenient anf foolproof as flat pack, the folded sheets don't fight you too much, and the nonstick quality may be even a hair better than my commercial sheets. The box is tiny, only 1/4 the size of a half sheet pan and less than an inch thick, very easy to find a home for. And iy you use a quaryer sheet pan (toaster oven size) a lot, the folds are actually nice, because they make the sheets easy to tear in half.

Ummmm yeah. Well, I need to mull over that one for a while. Like, maybe write it out and tape it to my laptop the bathroom mirror the sun visor in the car. Anyone else?

Control Girl is divided into 9 chapters, each with between 3-5 devotional lessons for you to work through. In these lessons, there are Scriptures to read, really good words of discussion related to those verses, questions to consider, and focal verses for meditation and reflection. The lessons are accessible and well-written, good for someone new to faith as well as church veterans.

So far, Ive gone through the first chapter thoroughly (so good!) and have skimmed through the remaining chapters for the purpose of this review. I can already tell that Hagars chapter is going to step on my toes in much-needed ways, and the Control Girl to Jesus Girl chapter has some very practical steps for transformation.

Bottom Line: Shannon Popkins book Control Girl is exactly what I need. Its simple to follow but the truths contained on these pages are profound and life-changing.

As someone who draws & sketches I like to try out new pencils and pens - and these mechanical pencils with 1.3mm lead looked like they might be worth checking out.

In the package was five of the pencils a refill tube of 12 additional leads, and two replacement erasers. Each of the pencils come with a lead already installed - pulling one out I found that they are 2 3/8"" long (the refills are the same). To reload a pencil, all you have to do is pull off the eraser and drop a new lead into the opening in the top of the pencil. Replace the eraser and click the pencil top about a dozen times or more - till the lead appears at the point of the pencil.

Trying out the pencils - I like the triangular shape of the barrel, it makes it very easy to hold. The thickness of the pencil is nice too - very similar to the big fat pencils that first grades use. I also like to use those for sketching. I have to say the lead holds up well. I applied a bit of pressure to one while drawing and the lead didn't break. The lead itself seems to be a pretty good grade of graphite - makes some nice dark lines.

I really like these pencils - if I had to make a complaint, that would be with the replacement erasers that they give you. Not that there is anything wrong with them, just that being loose like they are - I know I'm going to lose them and never find them when I need one.

With that in mind, I ordered this unit, which is very close to the same machine that I have been using. The changes made on this machine in comparison to my old one, are only for the better. It does have a slightly lower hose pressure and HP engine, but this seems to not make any difference.
This unit has a slightly more flexible hose, which is great. It will actually hang on the hose holder. It comes with three spray ends: one is a single hard stream, another is a hard pressure fan shape and the other is a fan which is not high pressure. This one is low pressure for rinsing, etc.
This machine as well as my old one always starts on 2-3 pulls. Though it says it can use gas with up to 10% ethanol, at the advice of a small engine repair guy, I only use straight gas with no ethanol.  There is no gas/oil mixing.
This unit is easy to move around, and for storage, the handle, and hose come off. The extra hose ends have an easy on/off ring on the wand. You can change the type of pressure stream easily. The extra wand ends are stored on the handle.
I have found that when you remove the pressure hose, make sure that you let out the pressure with engine and water supply off, at the trigger. This makes it very easy to turn the hose connection off of the pump pipe. You can easily do it by hand.  I found out the hard way on my old unit, that by forcing the hose off of the pump connection, it is easy to strip the hose threads. This was a $125. lesson. I was also told by the repair guy that it is unwise to leave the power washer engine running without the water going through the wand for more than a very short time. The engine is cooled by the water going through it.

7831,"UPDATED:

After 2 years, I have to throw this microwave out because it's raining rust down on our food from above the top vent. It appears the whole ""ceiling"" of the microwave is rusted on the side that I can't see. After 2 years! For no reason! I've had plenty of microwaves before, and this is a first. Of course, I had the cabinet custom trimmed around it, so now I'm really in a terrible position having to buy a new microwave AND have a contractor come make a new trim for it. Horrible. I'm so aggravated.

-----
So far so good! I know several other reviewers have recently had trouble with the door sticking, but I'm not having that problem. It's been consistently good so far, and heats food quicker than my previous microwave. It looks nice and feels solidly made.

This is probably an unusual problem, but I'll mention it anyway: I got the microwave because I needed an in-cabinet microwave. I had just ordered new kitchen cabinets and the designer suggested I order a base microwave cabinet and put the microwave there rather than on top (I have a weird layout). He ordered a 30 inch base microwave cabinet and told me he'd put a wood facade around the microwave. After I bought this, he told me the microwave is much too small for the cabinet and I should have ordered a drawer microwave... but I can't afford that!

There was a trim kit for this, but it's no longer available here and I'm not sure if it's made anymore-- but regardless, it's not a great fit for a big base cabinet. Waste of space. Measure carefully if you're planning on going this route.

That said, the microwave itself feels like a very good deal.",3,"[-1.327754105022684, -1.57996763502737, -1.6430388797783597, 1.0964933166053639, -3.128337257172654]",1.0964933166053639

  One quote from his book Where I Am, that I love is this. Talking about Jesus, This penniless preacher has invited the whole world to His coronation. Have you accepted the engraved invitation from the Heavenly palace, sealed with His royal emblem-thee distinguishing mark of His royal blood?
  Billy talks about how much he is looking forward to going home to Heaven. It just makes you look forward to going home yourself.
The book talks about how God is a God of love, but also of justice and mercy. He loves us, but won't put up with our sin. Also how even the vilest person God wants them to come to Him.
  In Where I Am, Billy Graham tells us that Hell wasn't made for humans, but for the devil and his followers, but those who don't accept Jesus will go there. Its a very sad and sobering thought that people will go to hell.

Cloris Leachman channeled Irene Ryan to perfection.

Jim Varney didn't try to channel Buddy Ebsen, and that was for the best. It would have never worked. However, he captured the quiet and naive dignity of Jed Clampett very successfully.

Ellie May is probably the least challenging of the roles, and Erica Eleniak did a good job.

Dabney Coleman was the perfect ""type casting"" for Drysdale. All he had to do was give his normal sleazy businessman performance, and he delivered.

Lily Tomlin was a bit over the top as Jane Hathaway, but that's what you expect, and what you get, from Lily Tomlin.

The only casting I thought missed in big way was Diedrich Bader as Jethro. I just never bought his characterization.

The plot hit on several tropes from the early years of the TV show, and I enjoyed that:
* turning Ellie May into a lady
* Jed finding a mother for her
* unscrupulous people out to swindle Jed
* the whole ""fish out of water"" genre treatment

For whatever eason, I 'dismissed' when this album came out a year ago, but with a renewed push now that the Christmas season is upon us (in other words, October, according to the music industry), curiousity got the better of me and I had to check this out.

""Wintersong"" (12 tracks; 46 min.) starts off tentatively with a straight-forward cover of John Lennon's ""Happy Xmas (War Is Over)"", arguably the weakest song on the album. After that things immediately get a lot better, with a great adaption of the traditional ""What Child Is This"", followed by an intimate cover of Joni Mitchell's ""River"", and then the title track, the only new song McLachlan wrote for this album. Other highlights include ""The First Noel/Mary Mary"", with soaring vocals from MacLachlan, ""Song for a Winter's Night"" (which actually was recorded in 1994, according to the liner notes), and ""In the Bleak Mid-Winter"", another traditional beautifully arranged by McLachlan (you can just feel the Canadian cold coming through your speakers!).

Overall, this is a pretty terrific Christmas album. It reminded me in theme and atmosphere of Over the Rhine's excellent first Christmas album ""The Darkest Night of the Year"" (OtR has just release an equally impressive sequel CD, called ""Snow Angels"").

1896,"""The truth is the truth whether we like it or not.""
- p. 281 (hardcover edition)

In her fifth best-selling book, ""Godless: The Church of Liberalism"", Conservative commentator Ann Coulter lays out the argument for liberalism as being a religion, despite the fact that its devotees claim to be atheistic. According to Coulter, the mere tenants of liberalism make it a faith that is followed as devoutly as any branch of Christianity. It possesses stories of how we got here (evolution), has rules on punishment (Michael Dukakis' furlough policy that allowed Willie Horton to escape prison and terrorize a couple in their Maryland home), has 'moral' views on human rights (abortion), and protects members of society (teacher's unions). So why are liberals always claiming that they are not religious?

For the first half of the book, Ann discusses most of the topics listed above. Her comments are to the point, yet capture the essence of her argument. However, in the second half of the book (the parts on evolution), she becomes very long-winded. I understood her point in the first of three chapters on the subject, and the usually succinct Coulter drags them out. Despite my liking her other books, this one seemed unnecessarily drawn out.

The reason for the four-star rating? While I agree with most of Coulter's arguments (though not all of them), the writing here isn't as top-notch as I've seen from her before. The second half of the book is very slow reading compared with the first part, and at times I felt like she was merely repeating the same arguments over and over.

A fan of Ann Coulter? Read it. If you don't like her, or what she stands for, stay clear. You're not going to agree with what you read.",3,"[-0.9003982551724512, -1.9703096866735124, -1.5047824053223844, 1.0905123886910713, -2.8713280577055937]",1.0905123886910713

There are 4 sections of 30"" each, with very sticky tape on the back. Just peel and stick. You can cut these to the length you need with wire snips or very heavy duty scissors. I had to use a utility knife along with a strong pair of scissors to cut them.

They open up and snap closed, which can be a bit tricky. The plastic is flimsy, and if you overextend it, it'll break off. It has a lot of corners/connectors to make a long run.

The parts are very thin, cheap plastic. I can't for the life of my justify $25 on such a small set of cheap plastic. It really should be priced about $10.

I guess in the entire nation of Spain there are no beautiful Spanish actresses capable of playing this role. The hilarious thing is she plays both the mother and the daughter yet the poor makeup job makes both look exactly the same age.

Add to this the actor playing the painter Francisco Goya is Swedish and American Randy Quaid plays the Spanish king. OK, I get actors can play people of other nationalities but get real.

Plus this movie is not really about Goya at all and is supposed to be about what Goya observes during the Inquisition and the French invasion of Spain. Although I half expected No Country Bardem to pull out the air pump and kill Portman or a few Spanish priests, he sadly did not. It would have made this movie about as plausible as the casting.

In the ""making of"" featurette, Milos Forman claims this is a story the world has been waiting to see on the big screen. Really? People were dying to hear of the Spanish Inquisition starring Natalie Portman? I think Monty Python did it better, funnier and got the point across--these people back then were power hungry and insane.

Let's put it this way even the Spanish thought Forman's take was dreadful as it grossed barely over $2 million at the box office there and only $8 million worldwide.

7751,"I like a cup of tea before bed or during the day. I was looking for a teapot for one and thought a plain white one would match perfectly with my china. I looked for awhile and did not find any that I liked. I saw this one and ordered it.

When I received it I worried it was too small. When I saw the box I thought, ""Oh, it is really tiny"". However, it is perfect! I washed it and then filled it up with about 3  cups water. I can't seem to get more water in the teapot without it being full. I use the diffuser on tea that is even in bags so it steeps longer.

Quality wise this is made very well! I am somewhat picky and could not find one blemish on the pot. Style wise it is very modern and fits in well with any d&eacute;cor or china patterns.

I have used it in the microwave and just place it in for 3 minutes and 30 seconds. It states it is dishwasher safe on here but did not see it written on the box or the product so wash it by hand which is no biggie since I find myself using it daily anyway.

If you are looking for a cute little teapot for yourself, I don't think you would be disappointed with this one. It more than met my expectations.

I've tried them on a range of sounds, from a Bach cello concert to Lorde and the rich sound of Amy Lee and Evanescence and... can I say again that I'm impressed?

- 20 HZ - 20 kHz frequency range and based on my listening experience I have no reason to doubt it
- 93 dB sensitivity at 1 mW, again I believe it

These CAP dumbbells are nice because they can adjust to a variety of different weights. I do wish that they came with more weight.

Basically this is 2 20-pound dumbbells. Each dumbbell is as follows:
  -5 lb: Bar & Collar
  -10 lb: 2 5-lb weights
  -5 lb: 2 2.5 lb weights.

So for exercises that will need 2 dumbbells you will need to buy extra plates if you want to do more than 20 lbs per arm. However, you can get the dumbbell up to 35 lbs if you combine all of the weights onto a single bar. For me I can do high-rep isolation curls at 35 lbs so it is better than nothing.

Nevertheless, to have dumbbells in a portable case for easy storage under a desk for light use during the day, these are quite nice.

Maybe I'm just being biased, (AND I AM!!!), but Futurama was a better show than The Simpsons and King of the Hill. Only Family GUy could match it laugh for laugh.

7347,"Physical Graffiti is Led Zeppelin comming into their own. Too bad that this was Led Zeppelin last great album. Pysical Graffiti is the hard rock album at which all other hard rock albums should be compared. Though I don't this this is Led Zeppelins best (that would be Led Zeppelin II) I do think this is their second best album. Its has all the elements that go into making a classic hard rock album.
Physical Graffiti is full of left over demos and tracks recorded just for the album, which is why it was Led Zeppelins longest and not to mention heaviest album of their carrer. Most of the spngs are harder rock like the classic opener 'Custerd Pie' 'Night Flight' and 'Sick Again' among others. But there are also some softer tracks like 'Houses Of The Holy' 'Down By The Seaside' and the beautiful acoustic instrumental by Jimmy Page 'Bron-Yr-Aur' and the classic old fashioned boggie, 'Boggie With Stu' Epics like 'In My Time Of Dying' and 'In The Light' give this album depth. But lets not forget the epic to end all epics, the most poular song on the album and mybe Led Zeppelins best song 'Kashmir' Im not gonna go into detail but anyone who has heard this song knows its a classic among classics! 'The Rover' has to be one of the best rock and roll songs ever written, I was floored the first time I heard it, and the same can be said about the amazing 'Ten Years Gone' which is one of the best songs ever recorded. Other stand out tracks are the radio classic 'Trampled Under Foot' and the hard rocking 'The Wanton Song' The only weak seems to be 'Black Country Woman' which really isn't half bad.
You are truly missing out if you don't own Physical Graffiti by now, the musician ship is the best Led Zeppelin ever had, the lyrical depth is deep and meaningful.

Also I am using a large s-hook (Interdesign 06500 S Hook) with this caddy to hold my hand held shower. I rest the shower itself in the hook, not the hose, and I like being able to do that because it looks good and is out of my way. One of the suction cups will not hold for more than a day but the caddy still feels steady because the hook that goes on the shower pipe grips the pipe very firmly. The aspect of the caddy that I don't like is its depth. It extends too far into the showering space and considering that it is right there where you want to be, in the flow of water, its in the way. You can even bump your head bending to shut off the water if your setup is a tub/shower. I'm sure over time I'll get used to it being there but since i don't need as much storage as this caddy provides I'd rather it was not so deep.  What I really wish for is a caddy with long rigid hooks to hang from the towel bar on the wall at the far end of my tub so that I could store my things at a height reachable from standing or sitting.  Update - I ended up hanging this caddy from the towel bar using a 4"" S-hook.  The bottom of the hook curves toward the wall placing the caddy close enough to the wall for the suction cups to work.

The twist type closure is very good so you don't have to worry about it popping off by accident. I have read some other dispensers do that.

The only thing (which is minor) that I didn't like about the product is the little plastic clip that attaches the dispenser to your leash.  It is bone shaped as well and didn't sit right on my leash.  I think the size and shape were just awkward so I swapped it out for a plain old key carabiner which has worked like a charm.

I admit that I have trouble using bud earphones; they don't fit right and tend to hurt my ears. These did too. To me, they feel like they are about to fall out of my ear.

Following the user guide, it is easy to adjust the settings: time, date etc and your age, weight etc. The strap is comfortable to wear.

To check your pulse, you press the VIEW button for about 7 seconds and it shows your pulse rate. Then there is the START button to start and stop your workout. Third button is the MODE button for different settings.

I think the pulse rate was fairly accurate. To connect to Bluetooth app, you have to use Argus app and Move C300 connected easily to the Argus app on my iPhone.

I piped it into my receiver and hit the power button and bingo! it found my network over it's installed handy dandy wireless network adapter (G).  It prompted me for my password, which I entered (by turning the knob, which was kind of a pain) and it connected no problem.  You can also wire your connection through the network cable slot in the back, however, no network cable was included.

After that, I chose internet radio and I had choices galore.  The real beauty of this device is how you can personalize it.  Got a Pandora account?  Pipe it through this baby with ease.  How about Live365?  You can do that too.  Want to search the internet radio via genre? No sweat.  Absolutely amazing I tell you.

I created my Grace account, added stations online and podcasts and after unplugging the device and plugging back in (yah, they tell you to do that so it updates the streams), my customization was found on the device and away I went.

Here is the absolute frosting on the cake...I'm now streaming all of my music from my laptop and external hard drive to this device!  Sort by genre, album, album artist, create a queue, you name it, this thing can do it.  This kills the Windows Media Center that never worked right with my 360.

This SUPCASE is completely different.  It's hard plastic and feels very well in the hand.  It compliments the HTC very well, metal phone and the case feels stuff  and solid.  The edges help the case feel very solid in the hand and should provide excellent protection if dropped.

I purchase both the Black/Clear and Black/Black and think Black/Black looks lots better than the Black/Clear.  I was thinking that the clear back would let the phone metal color shine through, but that's not the case.

So, if you looking for a solid case, which provides excellent protection for the HTC One M8, this should be the case that you purchase.

1112,"The Illuminati was a scientific organization founded by Galileo to discuss matters the Church forbade research on. Feared by many and studied by few, they were more secret than any other underground organization in history. Over the centuries, the group faded away.
Or did they?
When famed physicist/priest Leonardo Vetta is found branded with the seal of the Illuminati, it seems like the cult has once again arisen. Vetta's experiment - the largest isolated quantity of antimatter - has been stolen. If not found within 24 hours, it will explode with more energy than any weapon previously built. It is up to Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon and Vetta's adopted daughter Vittoria to find the canister and safely return it to protection.
There's only one catch.
The antimatter is somewhere at the Vatican. Though the canister is appearing on a security camera, the camera has been moved - and the Swiss Guard have no idea where. There is not enough time to check out the entire complex. And with the papal conclave about to start, the world is watching.
Led on a chase through ancient churches in Rome, Robert and Vittoria's only hope of stoping the scheme is to catch the assassin, an Illuminati killer who has vowed to murder a cardinal ever hour until the canister explodes.
In this riveting novel of suspense, Dan Brown weaves a tale so deadly realistic it is terrifying. It is a world where no one is what they seem - and the end of the Church is threateningly close.

Paul was a tentmaker and his trade allowed him to travel and preach the gospel without depending on others for help.  Paul, originally called Saul, persecuted the early Christians and then came the day that the Lord shone a light down on him from above and asked him why he was persecuting him. From that day forward, he began traveling and spreading the word.

This book follows his trails as they are written in Acts. Since Paul traveled far and wide, there are photos from lots of places. Each page has a verse from Acts and sometimes a short inspirational quotation from a well known religious author.

Since I will never be able to see these countries in person, I am glad to see the photos here. It makes you realize how rough the apostles had it. They walked so far and for so long to spread the word and were placed in prison in some towns. There is a photo of the prison Paul and Silas were placed in while in Philippi, Greece. There are photos of places he visited like ..Turkey, Greece, Jerusalem, Syria, Antioch, Rome, etc. It follows Paul's first, second and third missionary journey (A.D. 46-57).

7884,"The most important feature of this BLACK & DECKER PROGRAMMABLE SLOW COOKER WITH DIGITAL TIMER (SCD4007, 7 Quart, Portable with Locking Lid, Chalkboard Surface) is that it's a genuine slow cooker--when you set it on ""Low"", it cooks at a low temperature without boiling your food.

This slow cooker is versatile--you can use the digital timer to cook on ""Low"" or ""High"" for a certain time (with an automatic shift to ""Warm"" when the time expires); or you can set the cooker to stay on ""Warm"" (not for cooking), ""Low"", or ""High"" until you power it off.  As the cook, you're in charge.

At 7 quarts, this is a very large capacity slow cooker, but that's a good thing.  A slow cooker is basically a small oven, which is why it's so good for roasting meats.  This one will accommodate large roasts or long strips of ribs ""as is"" from the meat counter.  There's no need to cut them to fit.

If you're making soups, casseroles, or stews in a slow cooker, you generally want to fill it 1/2 to 3/4 full.  With this cooker, you don't have to make only huge recipes, even though it holds 7 quarts.  Just remember that  if you fill it only 1/2 full, you can expect your recipe to cook faster, and to be finished 1 to 2 hours before your recipe's recommended cooking time.

The crockery insert and the glass lid are dishwasher safe.  The lid has a rubber gasket, and this will absorb odors from barbecue and other spicy recipes. There's no way to completely remove these odors, but they won't affect the flavor of the foods you later cook in the slow cooker.

The chalkboard surface puzzles me, because I've never had a desire to write on the outside of my slow cooker.  I suppose that if you transport food to potlucks, you might want to mark the cooker with the name of the dish, or mention that it contains peanut oil, or the like.  If you want to use the chalkboard feature, you need to rub the included chalk over the exterior surface before you use the slow cooker for the first time.",3,"[-1.776434118333571, -1.5133692478241234, -1.8676864123930343, 1.0679612407416643, -2.30710532247183]",1.0679612407416643

Here are the specs and features:

- 3 line protection
- right-angle plug
- 15-Amp circuit breaker
- 120V 60Hz
- Noise filtering 40-45dB
- Joule rating 1300
- UL 1449 Rating/Clamping Level 330
- 6 ft. chord
- Illuminated on/off switch
- LED surge indicator
- Up to 8 outlets

The warranty paper claims 'lifetime' for the item itself and up to $50,000  on connected equipment for 5 years.

The lifetime in 'lifetime warranty' promise is not the purchaser's life but the life of the product itself. To quote from the Fellowes warranty document, ""the lifetime of the product is considered to be the time until the product naturally ceases to provide surge protection"". In other words, there is a warranty on the product for as long as it works. To quote again, ""when the LED fails to light, the product has performed its duty"" and the lifetime warranty is no longer in effect.

As for the $50,000 connected equipment warranty, the paper enumerates 10 instances under which the warranty becomes null and void including ""4. Fellowes determines that the equipment was not damaged by an Event or that no Event took place. 5. Fellowes determines that the Surge Protector was not properly installed, was tampered with, or was altered in any way.""

It has a refreshing minty taste with an odd lingering aftertaste.  This might be thanks to the stevia.  My dilemma is if this is worth the price.  The first ingredient is water.  On the nutrition panel none of the amino acids, vitamins, antioxidants, enzymes & minerals the bottle says aloe vera contains are listed.  Just sodium & sugar.  The lack of any nutrients on the nutrition facts makes me wonder if there is anything what so ever nutritional about Aloe Gloe.

My normal choice for aloe is by the brand Lily Of The Desert.  Their aloe juice is certified organic containing only 3 ingredients:  organic inner aloe leaf, citric acid & potassium sorbate.  On the nutrition facts it says it contains 25mg calcium, 4mg magnesium, 58ml aloe filet (aloe gloe on the other hand does not even say how much aloe is actually in the water!)

I'm sure that helps make them attractive to the dog, but it bothers me to the point that I'm not a repeat customer for dog treats that turn out to have a strong odor.

One thing that I see expressed often in reviews of dog treats is concern over where the treats are made. I checked the Milk Bone web site and found this statement:

All Milk-Bone Dog Biscuits and dog treats are produced at our facilities here in the U.S. The majority of ingredients are sourced from the U.S. Like most pet companies, we source a limited amount of minor ingredients, such as important nutritional supplements or preservatives, from other countries due to limited availability in the U.S. We want to assure you that our strict U.S. quality and operations standards apply equally to all of our ingredients, regardless of the country of origin.

I would definitely purchase these dog treats in the future.",3,"[-3.280718272168376, -2.812479824795593, -1.9754020779692336, 1.0629834369970224, -1.9337034876580343]",1.0629834369970224

It is easily made--just add hot water to the powdered broth, stir,  and then let it cool before feeding it to your pet.

I would have given this product 5 stars if I believed, as advertised, that it would be palatable for most cats, but I don't think that is the case. I realize, at this time, I have only tried to feed it to two different cats (and neither would touch it after one little lap of the tongue), but I have owned cats for many, many years and feel I have enough expertise on their feeding habits to judge more expansively. Anything with Turmeric and little bits of parsley (or some other green herb) floating in it will probably not be attractive to most cats.

It arrived in quickly (I have Prime) and in good condition with a very well reinforced double cardboard box.  There is a minor assembly to do, the glass front doors need to be attached, the bottom screen tray and the kettle.  It came with a non-slotted aluminum scoop (I traded for one with holes for the kernals to fall through that I already had) a pinch of fairly large popcorn bags (NOT flat bottomed, so you can't fill them and stand them up - I bought some small, flat bottomed bags) some unmarked scoops and measuring spoons. NO sample packets of popcorn were included.  I purchased some 8 oz Great Northern Popcorn premixed bags to try. The directions for use that came with the machine and the on premixed popcorn bags was different and ultimately I used the directions that came with the machine.  After using it, I think either way would have worked fine.  Basically, heat the oil and kettle up first, then add the popcorn and salt works best.  It made plenty for 4 of us to eat full (small) bags of popcorn with a couple of refills. There were a lot of unpopped kernals, but I think I may not have heated the oil long enough. The 8 oz kit was done within about 3 minutes. The popcorn was very tasty... but maybe a little tough. I am going to experiment with my own popcorn and oil to see if this is different.  I estimate for our family gatherings I will need to pop 3 or 4  8 oz popcorn kits. I also plan to try using coconut oil that doesn't have all the yellow dye in it. Further, I purchased a set of 12 different popcorn seasonings for fun. Just sprinkle in the bags after loading them, not in the machine. I was dreading the cleanup, but honestly, it really wasn't bad at all.  I do recommend wiping out after each use to avoid harder to clean build up.

7588,"We live in a three story home with concrete floors -- which is the reason why we continue to survive hurricanes in Southwest Florida.  However the concrete slabs really limit our wifi to just our main floor.  I had tried two different ""range extenders"" with only minimal success, having to struggle to get a strong enough signal to be able to efficiently use my laptop downstairs.

The last time that Comcast came to our home to solve a repetitive problem I convinced the tech to run a second line into the lower level of our home.  That second line would provide service to two TVs and hopefully provide a stronger signal for our wifi on that first floor.  Rather than connect another Comcast router to this new line, I decided (with my usually faulty tech knowledge) to order this Asus router to use instead.  My son took a look at it and told me that it wouldn't work like I wanted it to.  However he proposed that we plug the Asus router into the Comcast router located on the second floor and hopefully get an improvement in our wifi coverage.

It worked!  It provided a much stronger signal for my downstairs laptop, reliable and fast access to the internet, with (so far) no issues as far as drop off or spotty reception.  Now I can expect a good connection anytime I need it while downstairs.  It helped of course that I was already familiar with Asus, having bought my youngest daughter an Asus laptop when she started med school.  That laptop really punched above its weight class!  SoI had no qualms about ordering this router.

Considering that I managed to solve my problem with this unit, even though it wasn't intended to address this issue, shows how far technology has come.

I bought them to use for coloring in some of the grown up coloring books I have purchased from amazon.  Just looking at all the colors is a nice experience.

My only problem is that with some of the paper of some of the Dover coloring books the marker would bleed through.  I also stick a lot of scrap paper under a design when I color.  If designs are back to back in a book, I use crayons or colored pencils.
One of the things I like best is the packaging. This is a great, convenient way to store my markers and I can see all the colors at once.

We cut a tiny bit off the tip of the bottle and run the nozzle over the cutting blades several times from both right and left.  Make sure you have some shredded paper already in the collection bin because when you run your first sheets through after using the oil it will definitely show up on the paper.  That would be going on the surface of your waste collection bin if you didn't have shreds already in there to help absorb the oil.

I can now say that I am back with inkjet thanks to the Epson WorkForce 845. This is fast. I just printed a 10 page document and it was done by the time that I walked across the room. Two page printing is also incredibly fast, and it is much quieter than my clickity clackity laser. The printed results seem to be resistant to moisture which is very important for real estate fliers. The two-sided print feature works well.

Scanning is a breeze as well. I have not had any problems (except with papers that have creases in them) from the autofeeder on the scanner. The scanning speed is not as fast as my old Brother network laser printer/scanner, but it is certainly not slow.

Setup was a breeze. I literally opened the box, plugged it in, turned it on, and typed in my network key. On my computer I downloaded the software from Epson and installed.

The green color indicator on the Hioki seems more intuitive to tell me that it's on and there's no voltage.

If you plan to have cable internet, there's no reason to rent a unit for $10.00 a month when you can buy your own. The unit pays for itself in just over 6 months, a far shorter time period than most of us will keep our internet service. If you make it to 12 months, you've saved money.

Set-up (with Comcast at least) was as simple as it gets. I simply went to their ""activate"" page after swapping out the unit, and about 10 minutes later, my internet was back up and running without any futzing around. YMMV depending on your setup and your service provider, but worst case scenario you're in for a short call with your service provider's support team to get the MAC address for your unit associated with your account.

This is a great modem for the price, and beats the pants off of renting. Save some money. Invest in owning your own router.",3,"[-0.95264272374246, -2.5924249535119444, -1.6633932738147252, 1.0532312934997057, -2.937650093678539]",1.0532312934997057
9660,"Although the Scotts 71030 Easy Hand-Held Broadcast Spreader feels a bit cheap and the spreader wheel is not perfect, I had no problems with spreading both seed and fertilizer with it - no clogs and everything came out satisfactorily. There is a button on the side of the handle that adjusts the size of the hole (ranges from locked to 5) that allows for different size seeds/pellets and also spreading rate as well. At the top where the handles meets the spreader vat, there is a button that you push that opens the door to allow the seed to fall out onto the spinner plate. Everything is plastic and is easy to wash/rinse between use. This is nice as it will allow you to also use this for spreading Ice Melt type products without concern for rusting or corrosion.

Maybe I ought to just try one batch of these. Mmmmm. They were excellent! Nice and fresh and good tasting. Yummy! I'm going to have to watch myself and not eat too many.

In any case, I went to review these delicious little wonders and couldn't find any listed as Kirkland Signature, but I did find these Milk Chocolate Roasted Almonds (48 oz.) and the photograph looked exactly like my Kirkland Signature ones.

9387,"""Battlestar Galactica"" is a remarkable TV series -- the first season was a revelation to viewers seeking intelligent sci-fi programming, and an amazing refashioning of the campy '70s original.  Season Two got off to an uneven start, though, and while the 2.0 package (with episodes 1-10) was consistently engaging, it didn't quite have the cohesive wallop of the first season.  Some fans were starting to wonder if they'd already ""lost it...""

Fear not!  Season 2.5 is a stunning series of shows, beginning with the resolution of the near-civil war caused when the fleet under Galactica's protection merges with the fascistic military crew of the Battlestar Pegasus.  The layers of human civilization are further explored in a series of free-standing genre pieces -- a noir crime episode, an aviator's action tale, etc. -- and then the main plotline is resumed with a vengance.  Cylon psychology and the intricacies of their resurrection technology are tentative explored, with thoroughly satisfying results.  Can't wait for Season Three!

I don't have a laser printer so I used an Epson inkjet printer anyway. The print turned out nice and dried to a durable pigment finish. Just be sure not to touch the surface and let it dry for several minutes, since the ink will smudge if you touch it, until it's completely dry. Use an inkjet with pigment based ink rather than dye based ink, since pigment ink is much more durable.

If you want ""Section 3 compliance"" where the labels are tested for abrasion resistance and permanence of print, Avery recommends the Oki C711 series laser printers and Epson ColorWorks C831 inkjet printer.

I used the wonderful web based ""Design & Print Online"" feature on the Avery website to create the labels. This generates a PDF document that you can save and print. This was quicker than using the Word templates that I used to use a long time ago.

The character of Viviane has the difficult task of somehow  bringing together Uther (Mark Lewis Jones)and Igraine while simultaneously helping Morgaine live up to outline of her destiny (while also preserving the spirit power of Avalon and enlisting the help of Merlin).  The movie also shows what happens when Morgaine decides to go without Vivianes counsel for a while (which unexpectedly gave me the idea to eventually look into asking a life coach for help in 2016).  Anyhow, Morgaine is close both her family members Arthur and Lancelot.  Arthurs wife Gwenhwyfar means well but is conflicted in her marriage due to her unexpected romantic interest in Lancelot.  The Mystics Dream song by Loreena Mckennitt plays in part of the movie.

Of course, the Presley estate would never allow actual Elvis music to used in this film (it would probably cost five times what went into the film in the first place), so, as far as I'm concerned, ANY film about Elvis without his voice suffers.  That's what made him the King.
You could have Elvis battling a mummy AND Martians and, if he sang, people would believe it.  Look at his movies!  The public bought just about all of them when they were released.  Letting Elvis sing would allow anyone watching the film to understand why he was who he was.  (But I can't blame the filmmakers for that because this is a very low-budget film).
In the extras, the writer/director admits that, trying to submit BUBBA HOTEP in festivals, he didn't know which genre to label his film.  That's another major problem: it never really decides what it wants to do.  It's never particularly funny and it's never scary.
It's not hard to see Bruce Campbell as Elvis and a lot of screen time goes into explaining how the King ended up in a Texas nursing home, but too little time is spent trying to convince us that the great Ossie Davis is JFK.

Recently I saw ""Jersey Boys"" in the theater and of course I was charmed enough that I decided to check out the movie soundtrack for this. Imagine my surprise when the Amazon search engine for ""Jersey Boys soundtrack"" led me to this...

""Jersey Boys Music From The Motion Picture And Broadway Musical"" (25 tracks; 62 min.) is flat-out mistitled as yes it brings music from the movie, and yes, it brings music from the Broadway show but on top of that, it brings the original versions of a number of songs from Frankie Valli, either solo or with the Four Seasons. In fact NINE of the compilation's 25 tracks are here are those original oldies, and it really makes me wonder why they are on here. If I wanted to here the original versions, I'd play ""The very best of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons"" from my music collection. Be that as it may, despite this strange decision, when you play this, it all sounds pretty fabulous, in particular John Lloyd Young in the role of Frankie (which he also played for a few years when the Broadway show opened).

Director Clint Eastwood's movie version of the Broadway play (which I haven't seen) seems like it differs quite a bit as the dramatic elements are played up and extended for Hollywood's purposes. The interesting thing is that as a result the second half of the movie (focusing on the band's internal tensions and Frankie's family problems) has far less music but makes for a more engagement viewing experience. But Eastwood does acknowledge the movie's Broadway roots in the movie's end titles, where it seems he is literally filming from the Broadway play, reflected on this compilation in ""Closing Credits: Sherry/December 1963 (Oh, What a Night)"".

Bottom line: ""Jersey Boys"" the movie is definitely worth checking out. As to ""Jersey Boys"" the ""movie soundtrack"", buyer beware! Lots of great music on it but it is not quite the ""movie soundtrack"" one would expect.",3,"[-2.2644787615911635, -2.0965327755037846, -1.6059919975129247, 1.0462823070179865, -2.7304862026772865]",1.0462823070179865

7793,"I have had this mattress for months now, and it is still like the first day I bought it.

I have always bought `traditional' mattresses. My last one was a Sealy Posturpedic and was not even 3 years old!  It sagged so badly on one side. It also made a lot of noise when I turned at night. It literally was giving me a complex. I am not a big person and do not weigh much so when your bed is making noise when you turn, you tend to think maybe your bed is trying to tell you something. In my case it was telling me what junk it was.

When this mattress came it was compressed and left at my front door. It was hard to carry it in by myself. I had a friend come over, who handles packages at UPS, open it for me and we both moved it into my bedroom. I have a platform bed but to be safe, I bought some additional wood (smooth) at Lowe's hardware so it was more than level. The mattress has a cover on it and has a grip feeling on the underside so it stays in place. I am sensitive to smell and did not notice a smell on the bed. I let it air out all afternoon and evening, and was able to sleep on it that same night.

I will say it is very firm. It is not too firm for me though. I have a waterproof mattress pad on top of it, a pillow top one, and a heated mattress pad. I was scared I could not use the heated mattress pad but have not had any issues with it. I keep it on top on the other pads.

I can not think of any complaints with this mattress. I was concerned about the edges. Someone wrote that they went down if you sat on the edge. I will say that is not true. Mine holds up very well, if not better than a traditional mattress.

I wanted to wait a few months before posting my review to see if the mattress changed shape or form but it has not. I love crawling into bed. I will mention I have arthritis in my knees, hips, and hands. I also had/have back issues due to a difficult pregnancy. I could not walk for months. However, with physical therapy and sleeping in this bed, I do not wake up with any pain at all. It hugs my pain at night.

I highly recommend this mattress and for the price you can't go wrong.",3,"[0.15707336633713442, -0.28420728320381583, -1.7930053165209088, 1.0419944378139316, -2.282529291866884]",1.0419944378139316

7477,"Once upon a time, an SLR came with a 50(ish) mm ""standard"" lens with a maximum aperture of somewhere in the f 1.4-2.0 range. Today a 28-70mm (or digital equivalent) zoom is usually kitted with an SLR. This has a maximum aperture generally in the f 4.0-5.6 range. That's something like 1/2 to 1/4 the light gathering ability, and often considerable optical quality, given away in exchange for cheap zooms.

If you're looking at this, then you've probably decided on a 50mm or so prime lens, likely because the kit zoom lens is both slow and not very good quality. Here are the options for Canon:

Canon 50mm f/1.8 (version 2): It's inexpensive, very fast compared to any cheap zoom and exceptionally good for the price. On the down side, it's cheap feeling, noisy in focusing, and difficult to focus manually. You should buy at least this.

Canon 50mm f/1.4: A little bit faster, but that's a less important trait these days with good digital high effective ISOs. More importantly, it's robust, easy to use, with full-time manual focusing (you can just grab the ring even when it's autofocusing), and good image quality

Sigma 50mm f/1.4: More expensive than the Canon lens, but slightly better image quality wide open. It's a tough sell since the quality change isn't huge. But if the extra money and Sigma logo don't bother you, then go for it.

Canon 50mm f/1.2: Big money for that extra light-gathering ability. If you need this for photographing in a club, then you'll buy it. If you don't need it, it's too expensive and heavy to compete with the lenses above.

Another, used, option, the original Canon 50mm f/1.8 EF lens was sturdier and better built, but they're only available used and possibly abused. I own one and am happy with it.

Since I am spending more time photographing people, and proper skin tones are so important, I knew then that I would need to buy a unit to calibrate frequently, so put the Spyder on my Amazon Wish List at that time, hoping for a better price. When a large discount was offered in the Daily Deals last week, I clicked the order button right away. (This is a plug for the Amazon Wish List; when you add items, Amazon will prompt you when a better price is announced.)

Today, I installed the software, activated my Spyder unit and recalibrated. The software installation and activation process is highly automated and easy to follow, and the calibration process is virtually hands-free. I just had to manually adjust the brightness on my Dell U2412M monitor. I set the calibration interval for one month, but may do it more often since the process is so streamlined.

7558,"We have a few computers in the house.  I teach computer science at the college here, and we use them all the time for both work and recreation.  This memory is what you need for many modern (recent) laptops.  This stick of memory allowed me to upgrade two of my laptops.  (Both, BTW, are ASUS.)  One of my laptops had eight gigs of RAM.  It has two memory slots, and each had a 4 gig memory simm in it.  I took one out and put in this 8 gig stick, which gave me 12 gigs in that computer.  Another of my laptops had 4 gigs, in the form of two slots with two gigs in each.  I replaced one of these with the 4 gig stick I had removed from the first laptop.  Net result:  One computer went from 8 to 12, and the other went from 4 to 6.  If I buy another one of these, I could do it again.

Install was very easy.  On the bottom of most laptops there is a plastic cover held on with some screws.  Remove the screws, lift off the cover, and the memory is right there.  Push the little silver tabs to the sides and the memory will pop up.  Carefully remove it and push the new one in place.  Then press it back down until the silver tabs snap back into place.

7882,"After debating for a year, I finally decided to pick up the Anova Sous Vide since it was on sale on Amazon.  I am now wondering why I didn't pick this unit up sooner.  Cooking with the Anova Sous Vide has made kitchen time much less hectic.  Similar to a slow cooker, I'm able to put food items that are vacuum sealed (or water displaced) into the water bath and leave it until I'm ready to serve the item.  Unlike a slow cooker, food is not boiled to mushy consistency - I've tested this out with steak, eggs, pork ribs, and chicken with great success  Meats comes out perfectly cooked, very juicy, and after a short sear on a fry pan or 15 minutes in the oven to finish, dinner is ready to go.  Active cooking time for me has cut down dramatically, and this unit really has taken out the guesswork of determining how long to cook a particular meat to achieve a perfectly rare, medium rare, or well done cut.  Sous vide eggs are simply out of this world - for those who have had the opportunity to try an ""onsen"" egg in Japan, the texture is simply custardy fantastic.

The unit itself works very simply - just plug in the unit, immerse the metal end into the water bath, then set the temperature using the dial wheel.  The unit will heat the water to the appropriate temperature very quickly, and the water is circulated effectively using the small motor inside the unit.  Cleaning this unit is simple as well.  I've been currently using a large stock pot to hold the water and cook the food items, but I think I will be cutting into a cooler to make an insulated cooking vessel as many others have done.

Overall, this is a very easy to use cooking tool - it's something that's earned its keep to stay on my kitchen counter.  As an added note - my initial unit did have a small nut loose inside - I'm not sure if it came loose from a bolt or was an extra piece, but Amazon replaced the defective unit quickly and efficiently.

Not counting the Anthology albums in the 90's (which are not hit compilations anyway), the Beatles have in the last 30 years been compiled only once, on 2000's ""1"", an excellent overview for what it is, their best known and biggest hits. The 1973 ""Red"" and ""Blue"" compilations remain in print, and I guess are still selling. While the ""Blue"" 1967-1970 compilation justifies its continued availibility on 2 CDs, one really has to question why the ""Red"" 1962-1966 compilation does.
""The Beatles 1962-1966"" (26 tracks) clocks in at 62 min., way below the capacity of a single CD, yet remains on the shelf as 2 CDs (along with a heftly $31 retail price). This is nothing short of ripping off the buying public, in my opinion. The reason given by the label management is ""to keep the integruity of the original vinyl issue"", but is anyone really buying this? Shame on them!
The music on the ""Red"" album is of course stellar, that's not the point.

I must admit upfront that I am not a great fan of his solo work.

""Private Investigations: The Very Best of Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler"" (2 CDs; 139 min.) brings 14 Dire Straits songs, 7 Knopfler solo songs, and 1 new Knopfler-Emmylou Harris duet ""All the Roadrunning"". The big thing is that the Dire Straits songs are presented in original album-length format. Yes, the full 14+ min. of ""Telegraph Road, the full 8+ min. of ""Tunnel of Love"", etc. Also, no live versions of certain songs are found here (unlike on the ""Sultans of Swing"" compilation). Really only 2 (semi)classics are missing: ""Twisting by the Pool"" and ""Heavy Fuel"" (the latter in any event only a second rate carbon copy of ""Money for Nothing""). The 7 Knopfler songs are outstanding. If you don't have the ""Local Hero"" and ""Cal"" mostly instrumental soundtracks, do yourself a favor and buy them. You'll find one song of each on here. ""Sailing to Philadelphia"", ""What It Is"" and ""Boom, Like That"" are equal to his Dire Stratis-standards. The duet with Emmylou Harris is nice, but not essential.

If you distill the very best of Mark Knopfler's 25+ year career down to 140 minutes, it really is amazing how good it all sounds. As it should be, the emphasis is on the Dire Straits hits, but when you pick and choose in his solo output, there are some beautiful tracks there as well.

7776,"I am very surprised by all the negative reviews of this product.  I think we all know that finding a humidifier that actually works more than a year even with dutiful maintenance is rare.  Why they can't just make humidifiers that do what they say they will is beyond me.  I am recovering from the Honeywell HWM-331 which I purchased last year.  I cleaned it regularly and was so pleased.  It was my first warm mist model after always having cool mist.  It was wonderful till it broke .  In a matter of 5 days this season everything that could go wrong with it did.  So back I was to investigating for a new one.

I live in a studio apartment and have a strong tendency to sinus infections/asthma.  I chose this model for many reasons and am so pleased with it.  The Honeywell I had had a 2 1/2 gallon tank and it needed to be changed daily.  This model has a 1 gallon tank, covers the same square footage as the other and runs longer on that 1 gallon.  On low it runs for 24 hours and on high it runs for 12.  I run it all the time and have a humidity reader.  I am always within the comfort zone.  Only when it gets very cold out and very dry do I put it on high.  Otherwise it stays on low.  Yes, it does make a low, slight noise as it works but it is so minimal.  Also, it doesn't make my apartment as warm as the other did.

Bottom line, no static, my allergies are great and the machine takes up little space as it works over my whole apartment.  The nightlight is also appreciated for I always know it is working.  There is no perfect model out there and no humidifier, no matter how good the quality, will keep all from getting sick, etc.  And all warm mist models will get calcium buildup on the walls when used frequently.  It goes with the territory.  People are complaining about it with this model and I had the same problem with my previous Honeywell.

I don't know if they ran a bad batch or if some dogs reacted to an ingredient that was sourced from a different supplier when they made it, but there does not appear to be any difference in the formula from what I can see on the labels of the 38.5 size bage and this newly packaged size of 35 pounds.

So I like the fact that this MARWARE CLEAR SCREEN PROTECTOR KIT FOR KINDLE FIRE HDX 8.9"" includes two sheets of protective film.

Second, you remove the protective sheet (#1 tab) from the weak adhesive side of the film.  Third, you apply the film to the HDX screen.  Fourth, you remove the remaining protective sheet (#2 tab).  Finally, you smooth the bubbles out with the included stiff cardboard ""squeegee"".  If you want to try again, the protective film peels off easily without leaving any residue.

No need to transfer hot soup to a blender.  It's much safer & easier.

And it actually chopped & blended the sauce to the proper consistency.  The chopper bowl can go in the dishwasher on the top rack.

I also often drink coffee throughout the day. Any coffee (top quality beans or canned Folgers) will ruin if they sit on a drip coffee maker's hot plate to keep it warm. I fill this up with boiing water to preheat it while my freshly ground beans are brewing in the Press. I then insert a tea mesh filter onto the top of the thermos after emptying the water and I pour the French Pressed coffee into the Thermos through this additional strainer. This helps remove almost all of the sludge that sometimes you get at the bottom of you coffee cup.

Back to the Thermos: Depeding on how full the thermos is it will keep the coffee really hot for 6 to 8 hours. After that, it sometimes needs to me microwaved for 30 to 40 seconds to be hot enough. This, of course deteriorates the flavor. So, the key is to not make more coffee than you'll consume in more than 6 or 7 hours.

7711,"When the jar of this spread compares it to "" the leading brand of chocolate hazelnut spreads"", we know they're talking about Nutella, right?  So let's compare Nutella to this.

(1)  Nutella lists 7 ingredients at their website:  sugar (75% beet/25% cane); palm oil; hazelnuts; cocoa; milk; lecithin; vanilla.  Chocmeister lists 7 also:  cane sugar; cocoa; hazelnuts; palm oil; chicory root extract; lecithin; vanilla.  As you see, they are almost the same, except that Chocmeister contains chicory root and Nutella contains milk.  (Chocmeister merely says ""may contain trace amounts of milk and soy."")

(2)  A 2 tbsp. serving of Nutella contains 21 g sugar and 2 g protein while 2 tbsp of Chocmeister contains 15 g sugar and 3 g protein.

What follows below is my personal comparison of the two products.  YMMV.

(1)  The Chocmeister is too runny.  I will only use it on ice cream.  It's too messy at room temperature for other uses and if you refrigerate it, it becomes solid and unspreadable.

(2)  The Chocmeister seems to contain more cocoa, at least that's my impression.  If you like an overwhelming chocolate taste to your spread, I guess that's a good thing.

(3)  I can barely taste the hazelnut in the Chocmeister.  It either contains less nuts or the chocolate is too overpowering.

Bottom line:  Even though this contains less sugar and more protein than Nutella, I do not like it as well because it's too runny, too chocolatey and not nutty enough.",3,"[-1.5127456875169805, -1.5640749450936586, -1.5035337484791955, 0.9717478968219379, -2.560293193934556]",0.9717478968219379

I wanted to make two other things with the milk. One, coffee cream, and the other, almond milk yogurt. Store almond milk won't work for the yogurt. It has too many preservatives and additives.

  To make milk, I used one cup of almonds with 4 cups of water. (lots of videos on youtube). For other things, all you have to do is vary the amount of water. I used one cup of almonds to one cup of water for the cream. For a very creamy yogurt, I used one cup of almonds with 2 cups of water.

There sure is a big difference in taste, when you make your own fresh almond milk, almond butter, almond cream and yogurt.  I will be buying this again soon.",3,"[-2.3794908046927965, -1.925107843842066, -1.7425429355502366, 0.9715868243261045, -2.2816248395517853]",0.9715868243261045
