It features a slim design so it can fit in tight places. It lasts about four hours per charge and doesn't dim very much as the charge goes down.  Which leads me to the two things I dislike about it.  One, the unit I received for review flickers quite a lot, and it's VERY noticeable when working on objects near the light.  It tends to stop flickering near the end of the charge..  It's annoying, but it's possible I simply got a defective unit.  Second, there is no warning that I can detect when the charge gets low. The unit just turns off completely until you recharge it.  A pre-warning flashing red LED on the unit would be a big help to anticipate its impending shutoff.

It's his most infamous because of a serial killer doing a Donald Duck impression and seeing a lot of women cut up in various gruesome and sick, sick ways.  The film has all the usual Fulci ingredients:  bad story, atrocious dialogue, bad dubbing (though I'm sure this would be a piece of garbage in Italian as well), crappy camera work, just all around unprofessional, tacky, and a complete waste of time.  I kick myself a lot when I decided ""I should give this guy a chance"", so I saw a lot of his films (too many), and I dread the name Fulci, as it is synonymous with ""worst films ever made"".

I think the BBFC did the larger viewing public a disservice when they classified this as a ""video nasty"" (and other Fulci works), because it made many people go out and seek it out.  They should have just let it slide through and labeled it ""mediocre, preposterously s****y, enormous toilet dropping of a movie"".  I sometimes think that because Fulci is so reviled by many that people assume he must be a genius that ""film snobs"" or ""elites"" don't get.  This isn't true at all.  He's just a really bad filmmaker who made a couple of decent films (Zombie is his most consistent), and upped the gore quotient in the horror genre.

I mean, despite what the blurb suggests, it doesn't even have a main character. What do you do with a book that doesn't have a main character or couple? What do you do? (As an aside, that blurb is totally inaccurate anyway.) There's no plot. The characters do everything from pine for one another to assassinations to buy a horse that randomly gets bitten by a snake. There's insta-lust and a relationship that goes from 0 to 4,000 in about a page. There is endless agonizing over if the characters are a couple yet and if they're gay or not, all in artificial and exaggerated ways. There's pointless past trauma that is too much to be believed.

There is telling, telling, telling about how wonderful and significant and 'I'll be with you forever even though we've been a couple for 2 days' the characters feel, all adding up to basically nothing. Nothing that happens is believable. None of the emotions read as believable, not even the lust (though that's not really an emotion, I suppose). These men are supposed to be super elite soldiers and assassins, but they agonize over everything like teenager, and I don't just mean the emo stuff (though that's non-stop from page one) but if a teammate gets injured or is doing his part of a mission out of sight or killing. All the things a highly trained soldier would take in stride (and we're told they do) they are shown to whinge about. And the technical aspect of these soldiers?

I have tried every bread knife and slicing guide on the market. Most work fine. (The Mercer bread knife on Amazon  is the best.). It wasn't the knives or the guides, it was ME. I couldn't slice evenly no matter what I did. One end thick, the other thin, you know what I'm talking about right?

When this slicer arrived I had 3 loaves waiting. One was a no knead loaf with a very crunchy, crusty exterior, another a very soft Challah egg bread, and the third, ciabatta rolls.  I had to experiment, of course, to get the right thickness for me. I found that the 12 & 1/2  notch area on the dial made  about a 1/2"" slice and was just right.

The loaves were a bit too big for the pronged pusher at first, so I very carefully sliced off the first three pieces before using it to hold the breads in place. Yes, it's much better to follow the rules and cut the loaf in half to use with the pusher, but well, I was anxious to see how it worked. Talk about impressive! The loaves were sliced into PERFECTLY EVEN slices in a matter of seconds!  Yes, SECONDS!  I knew at that moment that I should not have hesitated getting this slicer.

I got over my thinking that I'll only use this for bread, and I  tried a yam that I had on hand. Wow, yam chips in an instant.

The people that don't like it, must have made the mistake of taking it seriously. I mean the Bride (Uma Thurman) is sitting on a plane with a big sword next to her while making a check list of who she wants to kill. That's pure dark humor, that right there is saying that it's not meant to be taken seriously. It's not meant to be realistic. Plus most the dialogue seems like the way a child would talk and not grown-ups. I admit some lines didn't work and made me cringe but they weren't bad enough for me to dislike the movie.  It's meant to be silly, cartoonish and yes extremely violent. When you think about it, wasn't Pulp Fiction the same way ? People are acting like Quentin Tarantino lost his touch but he didn't at all. Plus Volume 1 is basically just a half of a movie so shouldn't judge it until you see the second half. Tarantino took a big chance just releasing one half at a time and it's not fair to hate it when you didn't even see all of it.

60,"My review is based on my purchase of the CD.  As much as I wanted to give 5 stars for the content and insights, the reader was so subpar that I could not.

Advertisers have known all along that economic decisions are often heavily based on social, cognitive and emotional factors.  We can know too.  Author Dan Ariely gave incredible insights into ways that people commonly make irrational decisions.  Sure they were based on college experiments, but we learn a lot about ourselves from the results and Ariely's interpretations.

From knowledge gained studying irrational decision-making, I wonder to what extent we can rationalize behavior.  It seems the complexity of decision-making might be increasing, and the irrational biases are apparently hardwired.  For example, even though we know based on Ariely's research that we put energy into being penny wise and pound foolish regarding certain purchases, it seems likely that smart people will continue to do so.

The solutions posed in the book are really separate from the value of the knowledge gained.  Obviously, government has a legitimate role in consumer protection.  Consumers, working constantly and with no time to research the fine print of every type of deal, should be protected to some extent.  Even so, there is no way government can protect citizens from every pitfall.  It makes me wonder if a type of training could be devised to help me, and all of us, override most irrational impacts on decision-making.",3,"[2.208587855432543, -0.059449778118965346, -1.2058192811469197, -0.9813561906397257, -1.3731817452903023]",2.208587855432543

The writers attempt to reveal the mistreatment of Muslim women in particular is noble.  Her life story is one of many emotions, trials and tribulations and the efforts on her part to seek equality on behalf of others reveals a great mind in a great person.  It should be fair to say there are many more like her stymied by their religion and background and yet of equal mind if not courage.  I say this because no single ethnic group or religious sect has a monopoly on brains regardless of gender.  Many people are simply what they are taught to be.  To avoid offending anyone I seldom discuss or give thoughts on religion.  I am not knowledgeable enough to discuss the various aspects of the various religions but like many (I suspect) I entertain my own thoughts and opinions.  While this book taught me some about the particular religion involved it made light of the brutality of life for women living under the justification by that particular religion.  I despise anyone involved in the mistreatment of women.  Certainly in my life I have known bar flies who maybe rated a dope slap but the constant abuse and mistreatment of any woman rates as a punishable sin.  I cannot always say they are the fairer sex unless by fairness one means their attitude and treatment of others, male or female.

4376,"I didn't get along with the oddly constructed book. I say oddly constructed because it starts with an apparent execution but the next chapter the apparent victim carries on as if nothing happened. The key is that the chapters aren't time sequenced so the second chapter takes place before the first but no indication of that exists in the text. Instead one must reason it out. The execution scene picks up again at about the 80% point which does resolve several threads left loose from the get go.

Thats not the only disconnect I had here. There were many references and simple word usages which baffled me. Likely a good deal of my being lost was due to the book being placed in the context and word usage of the UK, however the references to the music and other pop culture figures which likely add dimension to this book for some, left me utterly at sea. Id say I didn't get a single music reference in the first part of the book. The second part improved my score to maybe 50% but I still was made to feel like an ignoramus by the author.

The book takes place in Ulster, Ireland where nobody exists without being labeled by his or her religion and judged by same. So everybodys a Prod or Finian and either hated or accepted based in the observers hatred or love for one superstition or the other. This is a perfect example of people killing each other over who has the better imaginary friend.

I grew so tired of the religious hatred, constant labeling of everybody based on their religion that the book became a weary slog for me. I didn't care for any of the characters finding the good or bad guys good or bad factions depended on the particular power balance at any given time. The IRA does disgusting acts as do the Loyalists if they get a chance.

The bad guy becomes obvious at about the 50% mark but by that time in the book, the persistent hatreds and annoying references to obscure figures of pop culture had worn me down to the point where I didn't care.

Pulled it out and put back in the 32GB one (which worked fine). Doing a little research on the web (something I should have done first before buying this card) I discovered that this older tablet can only use up to 32GB memory cards (doh!).

1003,"I haven't read any of the author's other books so I really didn't know what to expect from this book.  I thought it might be a humorous social satire -- when I told my co-workers the basic story line, they all laughed -- so I decided to take a chance on it. This could have been a scathingly funny book in the hands of a writer who really understands and likes women and can poke fun at our foibles without getting ugly, but this is not that book and apparently not that writer. I just don't find any humor in a man using sex to control and manipulate the female population and the overall feel of the book to me was misogynistic, not humorous.  Reading it made me want to burn it in my driveway to help exorcise it from my mind.

This book has a LOT of sex so don't read it if you aren't comfortable with that.  But all that sex is very unsexy and instead ranged from clinical to gross.  The first three pages of this book were my first clue that this was going to be an unpleasant reading experience.  The main female character is raped in a public courtroom and no one comes to her aid.  The circumstances are explained much later in the book but that passage made me very uncomfortable.

For social satire to be effective, it has to paint an accurate (even if exaggerated) picture of the follies of society it is intending to skewer. The main female character fails in that aspect.  She is supposed to be a young lawyer at a NY firm and the author has her fetching coffee and looking for chairs for a meeting.  Young lawyers do a lot of grunt work but it is all billable legal grunt work. And the notion that nearly all women would buy the Beautiful You products and then abandon their jobs, families and every other aspect of their lives reflect such a poor understanding of what women are like that it makes the book fail for me.

I don't throw around the term misogyny lightly, but this book felt anti-woman from beginning to end.  I really can't recommend that any women read this book.  I suspect that there will be a number of readers who think this book is brilliant and hilarious -- and I suspect that they will be overwhelmingly male.",1,"[0.9945504915798642, 1.6746929861806632, -0.6766801339669996, -1.0165843517753603, -2.2084341758911425]",1.6746929861806632

They make no sense, they are so ridiculously cheap, the dialogue is horrendous (in both the English dub and the original Italian version), and the acting is atrocious.  However, they are rather nasty in their gore.  You do remember it in all of his films.  Here, it's acid getting poured on someone's face, a man's face being eaten by tarantulas, and the usual zombies getting their brains splattered everywhere.  The ending is a bit surreal (which I usually like endings like that), but I don't know whether it was intentional or just an accident because of lazy, incompetent filmmaking.  I have seen many Fulci films, including House by the Cemetary, Cat in the Brain, New York Ripper, etc..  I saw this one twice.  The first time was with a friend, and she wouldn't shut up during it, commenting on how bad it was.  So I rented it again, and it was as bad as she said it was.  I even watched the original Italian version with English subtitles, and it was still awful.  People swear Fulci's a genius.  You can see his influence on many horror films today, with their emphasis on gore, incoherency, underdeveloped storylines, junk dialogue, and bad acting.  I read that Lucio was originally a comedy director in Italy, and he worked with Toto the Clown, one of the most famous clowns/actors in Italy during his heyday.

Admittedly, I'm not a prank person.  I enjoy a good joke but putting a laxative in another person's drink is cruel, especially when that person didn't physically harm you or do anything except be a jerk, is assault in my opinion. But, hello, bosses can be jerks at times. Maybe that's why her husband left her, she's evil and childish.

7793,"I have had this mattress for months now, and it is still like the first day I bought it.

I have always bought `traditional' mattresses. My last one was a Sealy Posturpedic and was not even 3 years old!  It sagged so badly on one side. It also made a lot of noise when I turned at night. It literally was giving me a complex. I am not a big person and do not weigh much so when your bed is making noise when you turn, you tend to think maybe your bed is trying to tell you something. In my case it was telling me what junk it was.

When this mattress came it was compressed and left at my front door. It was hard to carry it in by myself. I had a friend come over, who handles packages at UPS, open it for me and we both moved it into my bedroom. I have a platform bed but to be safe, I bought some additional wood (smooth) at Lowe's hardware so it was more than level. The mattress has a cover on it and has a grip feeling on the underside so it stays in place. I am sensitive to smell and did not notice a smell on the bed. I let it air out all afternoon and evening, and was able to sleep on it that same night.

I will say it is very firm. It is not too firm for me though. I have a waterproof mattress pad on top of it, a pillow top one, and a heated mattress pad. I was scared I could not use the heated mattress pad but have not had any issues with it. I keep it on top on the other pads.

I can not think of any complaints with this mattress. I was concerned about the edges. Someone wrote that they went down if you sat on the edge. I will say that is not true. Mine holds up very well, if not better than a traditional mattress.

I wanted to wait a few months before posting my review to see if the mattress changed shape or form but it has not. I love crawling into bed. I will mention I have arthritis in my knees, hips, and hands. I also had/have back issues due to a difficult pregnancy. I could not walk for months. However, with physical therapy and sleeping in this bed, I do not wake up with any pain at all. It hugs my pain at night.

I highly recommend this mattress and for the price you can't go wrong.",4,"[1.623820092183917, 0.9877196774573882, -1.4138308280313847, -1.0296115685412588, -0.9246769387544601]",1.623820092183917

5897,"First off, I want to explain the reason for my 4 star rating. It has nothing to do with my enjoyment of this story and if not for one thing I would definitely have rated it 5 stars. Normally I am not someone who rates down a story for minor things but I found the swearing being done by Reanna to be out of place for a gently bred young woman from this time period and Reanna was depicted as a very gentle woman so why would she be cussing no matter how angry she was? Other than that one drawback, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I have to admit that I did not Like Killian much in the beginning but once I learned of his reasons for seeking revenge, I was inclined to forgive him. The scene with his mistress disgusted me, the fact that he brought her to their home and allowed her to talk to Reanna in such a way more than disturbing and his cruel response to Reanna's request which brought not only emotional but physical pain to her was hardly commendable. Like all heroes, Killian managed to redeem himself in my eyes but I loved that the heroine did not give in right away and fall immediately into his arms.  After the despicable way he treated her, it would have been implausible. The suspense towards the end of the book had me staying up late to finish it.  All in all, I found Unmasking the Marquees to be a highly entertaining romance taking me from tears, to anger, to joy and finally to suspenseful anticipation of a happy ending.",3,"[1.6147564392727898, 0.41797665672197404, -1.1184543917075374, -1.0158575526315805, -1.7069043571080318]",1.6147564392727898

The only absolutely negative note about this book was the unnecessarily crude sexual content.  It demeaned the characters who were partly defined by it, and that's a shame.  I understand it was used to demarcate the emptiness and futile hate or guilt of those characters, but it came off as cheap and crass.  This could have been expressed without the uncouth verbiage.

3019,"Ms. Denman's debut novel is quite simply everything I want in a book -- Her writing voice is smooth and easy and the scenes played out in my head like a movie while I read.  The characters are so life-like and relatable that I felt almost sad when I closed the book because I wouldn't get to spend time with them anymore.  The romance was so very gentle and sweet and grin-inducing. :-)  See? I even grin just thinking about it again lol.  And the plot ... Something we all as believers know about the church but wish weren't true:  Sometimes, churches get it wrong.  And when they do, they tend to get it REALLY wrong! But then along comes someone who lives out Jesus and slowly begins making the sad things untrue again with His help and with quiet and consistent demonstrations of His love.  The Cunninghams were people like this. Finally, the little bits of unanswered questions have me waiting most impatiently for the next book - Justified!!

Watching men brutalize each other for hour upon hour seems an implausible way to pass the time. I watched the 1st season and learned nothing from it other than that those in prison, or who make films about prison, enjoy romanticizing life behind bars when it is simply a bunch of damned savages behind bars. None of the characters seem to have any motivation or any goals in mind other than to commit mayhem. The fact that the protagonist in the first episode winds up being half beaten to death and then having lighter fluid set aflame on him while recuperating is about as dramatic as watching grass grow. Mindless useless violence. I threw the discs in the garbage. To make matters worse these episodes have an aged quality about them, as if the episodes were shot forty years ago. The quality of film is far from crisp. A big bore and glad I didn't purchase a boxed set, assuming it is available.

But later found out that only loathing, disgust and despise to each other, a deep cynicism remained in their marriage. And in this pathetic and another highly unlikely film, we had an old fart, a walking-dead and walking-stiff American(?), played by the English, Sir Michael Caine, a widower aimlessly and mindlessly lived in Paris, the city of forever romance, just awaiting the Guy in the Black Hole to summon him anytime. Then miracle happened, a miracle that could only happened in a MOVIE; he met a young French woman twice younger his age. Then he suddenly rejuvenated, started to shave his white beard daily, had his fuzzy hairs on an almost baldy head professionally cut, shampooed and hair saloon-ed. Then his son with a broken marriage showed up and messed up the relationship and took over. What a pathetic but also so stupid scenario, I cried out-loud and asked myself: What is the purpose of making this movie? Why suddenly the movie makers became so interested in producing such kind of fantasy to fool we old farts? Then as it seems not enough to quench such last hurrah of romance, yearning to happen by most senior citizens, came the even more stupid and disgusting movie, ""Elsa & Fred (2014)"". Lord of Mercy, when you become such an old fart with all the joints hurt so bad day and night, with blurry eyesight with floaters swimming freely in your eyes, loosing, stinking rotten teeth, bad smell and mysterious odors oozing out of your body, with chronicle constipation, uncontrollable gas rumbling inside that results constant farting, noises whistling in your ears, swollen knuckles, shrunk muscles no matter how you try to exercise, white stubs under your chin...yet you are still craving for young women...and if you still have lot of money, would it be still possible to happen?

1920,"While browsing in my bookstore, I came up with this book in my hands. In the back cover, the text was the same as one of the editorial reviews stated in this page, the one that ends with: ""... and his name is Jesus Christ"".
So I thought: relics theft, worldwide plague, human cloning, and Jesus Christ all in the same story. These are elements that could make a book great. I Bought it.
After reaching the end of the book, I was very disappointed. The back cover text is not true at all. ""Year zero"" is not an adventure nor a thriller, but more like a philosophical text about a world that was devastated by an ancient plague and the effort by those who were spared to quickly find a cure. Although Long's writing style is not bad, his plot and his characters are dull and boring. After the first 100 pages, which are indeed very interesting and set a premise that could be much more well developed, it's all downhill.
There are many books dealing on apocalypse-like and dead-end-for-humanity situations and many of them are better than ""Year zero"": ""The stand"", ""On the beach"" are just two of them.
If the editors had not wanted to create an adventure-like atmosphere to this book, maybe I would have set my mind on a different frame-reading, and then I could have enjoyed it much more. As it is, I didn't.

When I got this book it was a freebie, and our family motto has always been ""If it's free we see"" (or read!). Evidently I didn't give it much thought though when I read it and just jumped on to the next free one I had downloaded; I also was not reviewing books at that time.

Much later I downloaded a boxed set, ""Passionate Bites: Hot Tales of Vampire Romance"" and BOOK TWO of the VAMPIRE AWAKENINGS series,""Destined"", was the FIRST ONE in ""Passionate Bites:..."" but unless you read the author's info on other books she has written that is placed at the intro in the boxed set one, you would not know that.  I happened, luckily, to catch that fact and went on a search to read the reviews of this, the first book, only to discover that I had already read it.

Since I couldn't remember anything about it at all I read it again to refresh the story in my mind.  Technically this is a stand alone book, there is no cliffhanger that forces you to go on to finish the story. It was very interesting to me at times, and very repetitive at others.

When you rent this, are you thinking you will see an Academy Award hopeful?  Is it chock full of Golden Globe performances?  Do you really demand full character development in a shoot-em up movie?  If you do, then simply don't rent this DVD.
If you are thinking this movie will blow you away, it won't.  But it is good enough to spend the money on a rental.  Don't believe the harsh reviews on it though.  Those people are just expecting WAY too much from a simple action film.
That's the best way to describe the film:  simple.
Although, the reviewer that comments about all of the gangs magically coming together to take on the police force for the money is spot on.  That was way too stupid, even for this flick.

285,"Faking Normal is a tough novel to read. Sure, its about rape but what really bothered me was her incapability to tell someone no. I understand her not speaking out about the attack. I understand her second guessing. I understand her thinking it was her fault. However, what I don't get is how when something is presented to her that she doesnt want, whether its going to the dance, having peas on her pizza, or having her date throw himself on her. Instead of just saying no, she says sure or makes non-committal noises. There was never any protest from her. She just went along with everything and anything and it really irritated me.

I loved the slow building relationship between Alexi and Bodee. They weren't even friends before he moved into her house. In fact, he was known as the the Kool-Aid Kid, a kid who the school talks about because he dies his hair a different color with Kool-Aid every day. So, when he comes to live with Alexis family, shes sort of forced to be nice to him. Then they slowly become awkward housemates. Over time they became friends which became each others support for the darkness they were harboring within. Their relationship and the fact that he slowly pulls Alexi out of the shadows is what kept me reading.

My favorite part of the whole book is the authors note to the readers. She talks about abuse and gives advice to those who may have been assaulted in some way. She reassures the readers that its not their fault, the pain of what you're feeling will get better, and that it does not define you. I think her letter was very powerful and one that just about brought me to tears.",3,"[1.4375121933205406, 0.1485394538429996, -1.09432082325767, -1.0025479668320911, -1.7689583091931513]",1.4375121933205406

I think by now their story has been told and we are all ready to move on. With that said I am glad they did have a third book and the two getting the ending they deserve and I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Dean. He is all kinds of sex.

I think my problem with the third book is by now I realized that Dean and Liv have way too much sex. I was starting to think all there is to their relationship was their physical relationship and I never thought that until this book. I was double thinking everything about them. Maybe that was the authors intent but I do not think it was.

The book was 60% sex scenes and I was skimming through the pages. I really wanted to feel connected to the married couple but I couldnt. I just kept thinking Really, sexy AGAIN?!

Liv to me in this book was just annoying. Still with everything she seemed too independent on Dean. I was proud of her though when her mother came around and she stood up for herself but she did that before Dean came into the picture.

I do not know how I feel about this book. It was needed for an conclusion but I felt it did not do the couple justice at the end. I liked the ending okay but it was predicable; I was hoping to get more from Dean and Liv at the end. I also would have liked Deans family in this book. I really enjoyed them in book two maybe because they were so dysfunctional they made an interesting story.

Why they can't just make humidifiers that do what they say they will is beyond me.  I am recovering from the Honeywell HWM-331 which I purchased last year.  I cleaned it regularly and was so pleased.  It was my first warm mist model after always having cool mist.  It was wonderful till it broke .  In a matter of 5 days this season everything that could go wrong with it did.  So back I was to investigating for a new one.

I live in a studio apartment and have a strong tendency to sinus infections/asthma.  I chose this model for many reasons and am so pleased with it.  The Honeywell I had had a 2 1/2 gallon tank and it needed to be changed daily.  This model has a 1 gallon tank, covers the same square footage as the other and runs longer on that 1 gallon.  On low it runs for 24 hours and on high it runs for 12.  I run it all the time and have a humidity reader.  I am always within the comfort zone.  Only when it gets very cold out and very dry do I put it on high.  Otherwise it stays on low.  Yes, it does make a low, slight noise as it works but it is so minimal.  Also, it doesn't make my apartment as warm as the other did.

Bottom line, no static, my allergies are great and the machine takes up little space as it works over my whole apartment.  The nightlight is also appreciated for I always know it is working.  There is no perfect model out there and no humidifier, no matter how good the quality, will keep all from getting sick, etc.  And all warm mist models will get calcium buildup on the walls when used frequently.  It goes with the territory.  People are complaining about it with this model and I had the same problem with my previous Honeywell.

There does not seem to be a ""main"" plot; the focus of the story is giving backstory to the other Nina Reilly books.  It's like one long chapter in a book-to-come. It did make for a pleasant evening's reading, though.

I agree with the reviewer who could not recognize Nina.  Usually I find her a little too cold and hard for my taste; here she exhibits superhuman stamina, but way too much emotion.  It's a little harsh to say she acts like she's in heat, but she does seem surprisingly interested in sex for someone as exhausted as she must be.

More importantly, I cannot believe that a woman as intelligent as Nina could ""accidentally"" become pregnant in the 1990s.  Affordable, efficient birth control has been easy to come by for DECADES; I do not think the accidental pregnancy plot is acceptable any more without a pretty strong story explaining how it could happen -- like maybe a poor teenager from a fiercely religious background and a weak self-image.  But NINA?? No way.  And we're supposed to think that she carried on a relationship with Filsen and others with no birth control?  uh-uh.

The main characters back and forth was getting old and drawn out, everything seemed way to easy, and sometimes them speaking to one another went from playful banter to borderline juvenile. I loved their growing relationship and connection in the first book and was missing it in this one, I didn't feel like there was a lot of depth. I really enjoyed the first book and as much as I hate to compare books, this one seemed to decline for me and I did not enjoy it as much. There was more light drama but everything seemed too easily solved. Things that were a major issue before with Laurelyn just seemed to be glossed over. Maybe they'll come back around in book three?

I like books with sexy times in them but I want it to make sense in the story and I didn't always feel that with this one. I also thought some of the things Jack Henry and Laurelyn said during these times were odd. Their sex talk and some of the descriptive words were just off putting to me. Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood to read it.

760,"Blame is a novel that takes us through two decades of the life of Patsy MacLemoore.  In 1981, Patsy is convicted of killing two people while driving a vehicle under the influence of alcohol.  She was in a blackout during the incident and has no memory of the event.  She is sentenced to four years in prison for the crime.  The book deals very realistically with the concept of alcoholism as a disease.  ""After a certain point, our disease takes us only to hospitals, jails or morgues."" (p. 27).  During her time in prison, Patsy becomes involved in Alcoholics Anonymous and is a firm convert to 12-step programs.

The book has a secondary plot which I found interesting and poignant.  A lot of the novel takes place in the early 1980's.  Several of the key characters are gay men and they are integrated into the plot very naturally as Patsy's friends. The onset of AIDS begins in the early 1980's and the novel deals with the losses and grief associated with this disease.

Approximately two decades after Patsy's incarceration, she is given information that turns her life into a tailspin.  She has to deal with the typical alcoholic's issues of shame, secrecy and silence in order to integrate this news.  To say more about what she is told would be to give too much away.

The book deals quite a bit with Patsy's love life and her inability to choose healthy lovers and companions for herself.  She works with a therapist to try to understand why she keeps repeating old patterns that don't work for her.

I liked this book but I felt that there were too many issues not dealt with sufficiently at the end, especially in relationship to Patsy's marriage and her own sense of self-esteem.  I think the book does an excellent job on educating the reader about alcoholism while also telling an interesting narrative.

1404,"I actually quit reading this book at the 30% point but then decided to press on and I was glad that I did.  I found the first part to be bordering on ridiculous but the last one half was much better.

The basis of the storyline is that that India Delamere's love, Devlyn Carlisle, was supposedly killed in the war but then showed up one year later in London without his memory.  If you read the book's description it revealed that India and Devlyn were secretly married in Brussels shortly before he left for battle. When he returns home, she shows up at his house to see him and tells him she is his wife.

Devlyn refuses to acknowledge her but actually attempts to get her to allow him to ""settle some funds"" on her and then the little game of ""I'm angry at you so I won't have anything to do with you"" versus ""I'll seduce you so you will remember me"" goes back and forth until it is absolutely silly.

**Huge Spoiler** Devlyn was not an amnesiac and knew for months before returning home exactly who he was and that he was married to India but due to his being on a secret mission kept to his story about the loss of memory. There was absolutely no reason for Devlyn to continue in this farce and let India suffer because he could have told her privately - she would have done anything for him. The best part of the book by far is when India attempts figure out what is going on with the ""diamonds"" and runs smack dab into a very charismatic, handsome French pirate.

Character development of the heroine was jerky and not written clearly;  the reader understands that Paige goes from physically and emotionally damaged wimp to strong magical ruling chick, but the writer fails to take us on that journey and instead more announces this.  Also, the physical scars which Paige allowed to rule her are never noted after the beginning.  My big issue is that college-attending Paige comes off really really stupid: she doesn't remember things anyone tells her, she shows no insight or reasoning abilities, and she struggles to comprehend things other Earth women easily mastered or understood.

These are the elements that John le Carre has worked and reworked in admirable prose and which are all in evidence in this book. lf Mr. le Carre were some other writer, I might conclude he was growing old and tired.

Part of the author's appeal is his disinclination to rely on the graphic violence that has become a staple in current suspense novels.

1)the scene she carelessly watched directly at the camera didn't delete.

2)there is no immediate response when the young girl reported to the stewardess that a man got into the restroom where a woman was already inside. what kind of training that stewardess really got?

3)the 911 operator and police responding times were both ridiculously long

4)so after the rocket blast, no one questioned her and just took for granted? nobody questioned her why she changed the room? and the victim just came up to her and said 'thanks'?

5)yeah, in order to make the young psycho looked bad, you just casted a young man who looked so obviously like psycho and still made the heroine like to talk to him in the airport? that guy's goofy and spooky face would turn every normal woman right away from him, albeit talking to him, having a drink with him, and didn't try to change seat right away. a terrible casting mistake.

6)did you ever open yourself up and confess so much of your personal life to a stranger, a fellow traveler, just because he coincidentally seated next to you?

THE GOOD:

It works very well to push large amounts of snow off cleanly-- even did a better job than my usual brush, with much less effort.

THE BAD:

The locking mechanism and connection to the ""broom."" My hands were very cold, which made it hard to screw on the foam ""broom"" to the handle, but I got it. Then I tried to pull out the telescoping handle, and couldn't. I had to step on the foam and pull up on the handle. That worked. However, it wouldn't stay locked in the ""out"" position. While I was pushing the snow around, the handle kept retracting. That would be pain enough, but here's what was worse:

The handle ALSO kept unscrewing from the foam. The foam was actually spinning around in the wind. I couldn't get it to stay securely on, even though I tightened it as far as it would go. The slightest movement made it loosen and start unscrewing again.

So, in short, I'll still keep it handy because even with the annoyances, it got the job done faster than with a brush and scraper and with less worry about scratching my car, but if I were looking for a snow broom, I'd try a different model first.",2,"[1.3080597019461158, -0.5317436367210524, -1.2052413385120682, -0.979347665281975, -1.4895327471682116]",1.3080597019461158

9447,"127 Hours is one of the better movies I have seen in the last few years. A climber falls and gets his arm stuck. He can't free himself and the film shows his experiences over 127 hours of agony. It never gets boring, manages to tell a simple but believable story and allows you to empathize with the main character's plight. Camp and comedy are avoided here in favor of an effectively dramatic performance about one man's ordeal. What struck me was how easily anyone can relate to this situation in some way. I'm surprised more people haven't rated and reviewed this little gem. It got 6 Oscar nominations but only managed to break even at the box office. The picture and audio quality are superb in this release. There is 103 minutes of bonus content.

It was fairly easy to assemble except for the little yellow centers, which kept popping out and flying onto the floor, but once that was taken care of the unit was impressive, looked very nice.

Adding the cylinder, which I had thankfully  filled only 1/3 with sugar syrup, was an unwieldy process, But  I did that over the kitchen sink and once I mastered that and everything was in place, and the feeder was ready to hang on my balcony -- that was when I noticed the syrup dripping out from UNDER the red flowers. Had it been dripping out from under ONE of the flowers I might have been more forgiving but ALL the flowers were leaking. Nuh Uh --  I just installed a new balcony rug and there is NO way I am going to hang that on my balcony.

The Hioki turns on quickly and lights up green with a quick flick of the knob.  But in order to turn on the Fluke, I have to hold down the button for a couple seconds and then it flashes red to indicate that it's on.  Sometimes I fail to press the button on the Fluke long enough, and then I have to press it again to turn it on or off.  The green color indicator on the Hioki seems more intuitive to tell me that it's on and there's no voltage.  The red flashing on the Fluke shares the same red color that lights up solid to indicate a live circuit, so while it's obvious enough, it's not as crystal clear as the Hioki turning green to red.  I'm not exactly sure why, but the Hioki is just more ""fun"" or ""pleasant"" to use.

The dialogue and situations are so forced and ponderous it's hard to really get into the film.  The script has wooden dialog, and seems to have spit out of a manual from a screenwriting 101 class.  Sure, it's about a worthy and important subject (working class woman having trouble surviving and paying the rent, so she smuggles people across the border), but that doesn't make it a good film.  Melissa Leo's and Misty Upham's performances are decent (I actually think Misty is better than Melissa), but other performances are laughable, mainly because they're so badly written that they end up being unintentionally hilarious when they're supposed to be somber (like Michael O'Keefe's portrayal of a state trooper).  Another unintentionally hilarious scene involves a blow torch with the young son.

I didn't enjoy this at all. I struggled finishing it.

The writing is not good at all.
Each character does a lot of talking.
The characters are young, maybe that is why I couldn't get into it. I mean when hero and heroine kiss, people make gagging noises and tells them to get a room, and that is in the epilogue.
I feel if it had character growth and better writing this could have been a good read, especially with the real life situations it was tackling. It was just poorly written. And not enough.
The details are lacking which ruins the romance.
I didn't like the epilogue, Dean got a home, yet there was no happy ever after. It was more happy for now, or just settling every one of the situations into the epilogue.

257,"I am a fan of Dennis Lehane, having read  innumerable books by him. This one, however, almost did not get finished.
I started reading this book several months ago. It started slow, but then I reconciled that feeling to knowing that this author is a consummate developer of plot and character development. So, I persisted, even though I could not for the life of me understand where he was going.
I put the book down twice. My habit is if I put a book down three times I will not finish it. But then I told myself, this is Dennis Lehane! So what gives?
After finishing several other books and doing reviews on each in the interim, I decided to give this book one more effort. That was when I was 50% into the read. Now, let me say this. Because Lehane's plots are so tight, I was able to leave and then return without having to re read pages. In other words, the story stayed with me (no matter how confusing I considered it to be).
In retrospect, I'm glad I went back. From the point where I last left off to the end the book it had me captivated. Again, This is Lehane the master character and plot developer at work (I mean The Given Day--are you kidding me?!).
When I finished, the whole point of the story came to me in a flash. Characters and plot all came together. Rising action reached a climax. Falling action and resolution fell into place and, once again, I was taken in by the quality of writing by this writer.

However, I did not like the story nor the characters of Fahrenheit 451 nearly as much. Montag came across as weak and pathetic, even when he was rebelling and supposedly thinking for himself for a change. And the minor characters all irritated me to no end.

There some good points but way too many negative points to even think about a three star review at this point. I took my review down to see if they would have this fixed by christmas. Well, that has not happened and the game is still buggy, slow, and has too many problems for it to get anything but one or two stars. Other games have been fixing their mistakes and this one seems like it just cannot get there in time for anything to matter.

This is M's flagship franchise. The reviews all praised it to high heaven despite it being near-broken. That was step one in the problem. No pro reviewer worth their salt ever mentioned how buggy this game was. And you think people are not getting paid to shill on this release? Or in the least they are sent out their own game which they play with fellow reviewers and no one else.... those are the only two options.

Single player still has tons of glitches. Halo 2 is a mess and there was no need to run two engines at once in the game as it isn't even true 1080p ffs. Halo 3 needed a full HD release by itself and instead got some half-assed release that barely looks any different than the 360. There is a huge lack of anisotropic shading to make anything defined in the distance. There are tons of jaggies. I could go on and on.... the biggest problem is the matchmaking which just isn't worth my time. Get Dragon Age or Sunset instead and reward a developer that did their job.

I'm not sure where to begin...I both love and despise this novel. This book is not a quick or easy read, but it definitely is thought-provoking. I normally do not even attempt books with bored housewives as the main character because, well, the stories are usually dull. This one breaks that mold. Although there are moments where I want to scream at this MC, her internal thoughts are so real and philosophical, that I wanted to know what happened next, but also how she would respond. The setting also plays a major role in the story. The characters are authentic, the story is desperate and gritty, and the writing is engaging and intelligent.

But really its nothing special.  Its got the typical Adam Sandler formula in it.  Hes an average guy shown in his average life doing an average job.  He meets a girl and tries to start a relationship with her but she shuns him.  But over the course of the movie, she learns that he is special.  The girl then comes around, gives him a chance and they end up together in the end.

The jokes are just okay and the acting is also just okay.  Parts of it are worse than others.  I mean can you really see Kevin James as the President of the United States?  Somehow I cant see the same actor who played The Zookeeper and Paul Blart as the leader of the free world.

The graphics of the game characters seemed like the makers of this movie were just trying too hard.  Seriously, how much can you touch up or polish Pac Man or Q*Bert?  Theyre just blobs of one color with dots for eyes in those old games.  Also I have to question why Mario is only in this movie for like 2 seconds?  And hes in the background at that!  I kind of thought in a movie that is about video games from the early 80s that he would be more prominent in the story.

All in all its just a movie that is okay.  It does give you a feeling of nostalgia for these games as you are watching the movie, but really the movie is just so bland that you find yourself just wishing you could be playing these old games.  And if you really want to do that you can download them on your smartphone for a few bucks or you can find videos of people playing them online.

You might not know this about me, but the Mars Needs Women trope is a guilty pleasure of mine. Kind of in the same vein as staying up late to watch cheesy, B-grade science fiction movies on the Sci-fi channel. Give me a bottle of red and a made for TV movie, at 2am and I'd be a happy camper. Laughing maniacally, but happily. You can't take that s*** seriously and the same goes for most well written Mars Needs Women themed books.

Ice Planet Barbarians is one such book. It is written with tongue firmly in cheek. It's not that there aren't serious bits, but the book doesn't insist on taking itself seriously. Which always seems to feel like it gives me permission to laugh at it, as if I'm laughing with it. It's freeing.

It's not without missteps. The conversant computer is a little too conversationally chatty and well informed, not computer-like at all. The alien physique seemed a little too specialized to human female pleasure to be believable. Even without many females, I have a hard time believing every it'll-feel-good practiced hadn't been explored in some way. So, teaching him to kiss was eye-roll worthy and  I don't know that the rape in the beginning was necessary to make being kidnapped by aliens for an unknown purpose terrifying enough. But for the most part, this was a fun space romp. You just have to remember what it's meant to be (and not be) to enjoy it.

The writing is wonderful, with lots of hidden meanings (and some not so hidden:  H/h's names are Adam and Eve...)  and symbolism and extremely smart dialogue.  In fact, I can always count on this author to provide amusing and witty conversations and there are great ones in this book.  The story has a nice pace and leads up to a slow boil of passion and tension.  So well done!!
A believable tale of love and passion between the courtesan and the vicar was going to be hard to pull off and it was well done all the way until the denouement.  Sadly, that was just too over-the-top, required too much suspension of disbelief and almost ruined the book for me.  That is why I only gave this book 4 stars and, in fact, this was more of a 3.5 stars.  Also, I am not sure what happened to the editing but this book needs to be re-edited and corrected!  There were way too many typos and grammatical erros (lots of wrong pronouns, for example.)  Very strange and not characteristic of this author at all.  Finally, another problem was the change in the heroine's name:  I just told myself if was the author vascillating between the heroine's  aristocratic monikers but it was very distracting.  In fact, the first time Eve, ""Lady Wareham"" was suddenly ""Lady Balmain"" I groaned, assuming poor editing.  There is probably an explanation but it took me out of the book each time it changed.  Not good.

54,"The story centers on an investigation by the NYPD and FBI of a worldwide crime syndicate known as the Midnight Club. The organizations secret membership is made up of powerful financial tycoons and underworld crime bosses. The club is believed to be headed by a Frenchman, Alexandre St. Germain, AKA, The Grave Dancer, who will stop at nothing to ensure his controlling interest in the syndicate.
The Midnight Club is one of more than two dozen James Patterson books that I have read. I rate the Club in the bottom half primarily due to the authors excessive use of rambling, boring and lengthy narration that seems to manifest itself throughout the book. Also the prime characters are never fully developed. Other characters haphazardly float in and out of the story but the reader never gets to really know them. There is also a distinct sense of implausibility and lack of reality to many of the tactical operations undertaken by the NYPD and the FBI.
NYPD Detective John Stefanovitch heads up the investigation into the syndicate. After losing his wife and the use of his legs from actions attributed to the Grave Dancer, Stefanovitch hooks up professionally with a journalist, Sarah McGinniss who just happens to be writing a book about the Midnight Club. She has a young son who figures prominently later in the story. Sarah is a recent divorcee. The professional relationship between McGinniss and Stefanovitch soon turns romantic. But this romance also lacks depth. Midnight Club could have been a great story, but Patterson chose to bring too many characters into the mix without developing any of them in depth.

On the positive side, this clipper is nice and quiet. Alas, it is totally non-helpful for our situation.

1302,"I've been a sporadic reader of Gothic romance since my teens (a very, very long time). I favor the ones without paranormal elements and, in that respect, Jennifer St. Giles' Gothics work for me.  In this one, for example, there is just a touch of the paranormal with the heroine and her sister having slight psychic abilities.  Other than that, this is a pretty straightforward Victorian Gothic.

What bothered me about this, as opposed to other St. Giles Gothics I've read, is that I felt it needed better editing to eliminate excess tangential subplots, wordiness, and repetitiveness, and there was a failure to fully realize the mystery plot and its resolution.  There was TMI about unimportant things, such as the h's sisters' strange ""tea"" parties with the H's brother and friends, or the h's preoccupation with restricted personal hygiene (although rather funny at first) when working undercover as a maid, the strange nighttime activities of the H speculated upon ad infinitum, etc. and not enough time spent getting into the mystery.

What's the mystery?  There were two murders, one of a woman some 8 years ago and the recent death of the h's cousin Mary.  Cassie, our h, infiltrates the house where Mary had been governess to a young blind girl, pretending to be a maid.  She spends most of her time making friends with another young maid, yearning for baths and uselessly exploring the house at night. I say ""uselessly"" as far as making any headway into the mystery of Mary's death, but it was very useful for meeting the H, who closets himself away during the day and is up all night making mysterious noises.

Because the book seemed excessively long to me, I tended to skim and read quickly towards the end.  Perhaps because of this I did not find much satisfaction with the ending.  Yes, the romance ended with an HEA but I remained a bit puzzled about the first murder, the one 8 years ago.  Not wishing to go back and read more carefully, I'll just resign myself to not knowing.

This was free.  As such, it's an OK read, but, IMO, not if you have to pay for it.  I doubt I'll read the sequels unless they are offered for free at some point.",2,"[-0.4052168196798903, 1.1053109723971586, -0.32769088787982326, -0.9942099493403092, -2.6741827991623186]",1.1053109723971586

The fact that to propel the story along, she does not use the tired, old trick of writing about a hero who refuses to realize he is in love and/or commit, while the heroine is dying with love for him.  This ploy I totally detest.  However, I did not particularly liked this story, even though it had many of the elements I enjoy in my romance tales.  Possible SPOILERS to follow:

For starters I never like it when the hero has been in love before, or when the heroine is portrayed as a spinter.  I also do not like it when the couple is apart for a long period of time, as they were in the second half of this story.  But what really put me off is:  that when push came to shove, Tate chose to ""personally"" protect Edward rather than Toby.  I get it why he did it.  It was the logical thing to do, arguably the only thing to do.  He had known Toby for only a few weeks  while his commitment to King & Country, as well as family was long standing, his decision was probably what would of happened in real life.  But then I do not read romance stories for their realism, I want to get caught up in the fantasy, that at least in the story, the She comes first with the He.

926,"Years ago Stephen King was my favorite writer; although for the past several years I had given up on reading books by him. However, when Amazon, during its price war with Walmart, was selling Under The Dome for just $9.00, I decided to give King another try. For about the first 200 pages I was sure that Under The Dome was a book that was going to make me a born-again King-ite, as he introduced an intriguing plot and several interesting characters that were reminiscent of the ""old days."" This faith was short-lived as too large a portion of the remaining almost 900 pages made for tedious and sometimes boring reading. King filled these passages with excessive, disjointed details and dialogue, characters that were not very well-developed and often seemed cartoon-like, too many plot contrivances that became confusing and annoying rather than stimulating, and an abundance of espousing on his political and religious viewpoints. Despite these serious flaws, I did not think Under The Dome was a bad book. When King was ""on his game"" Under The Dome was exciting, suspenseful and a page-turner. The problem for me, however, was that these exciting times were too few to sustain my interest in a book of 1,072 pages; and, thus, makes it a book that I would not highly recommend.",2,"[1.0773946019010225, 0.7697969423417075, -0.0904600284424597, -1.03973380068986, -2.2455957583175365]",1.0773946019010225

9432,"I couldn't finish this movie.

Like the annoying neighbor who traps the main character in his driveway over and over again, I went into each scene wondering if anything was going to make me laugh.

Jason Bateman's character is nearly vacant enough for Paul Rudd to play.  He owns a company and he doesn't get much from his wife...basically, he's a normal schmuck who isn't all that interesting.  He employs bickering employees who aren't that interesting either.  You would not want to hang with any of these people during or after work.  Milas Kunis is a smokin' hot chick but she's such a despicable person, stealing and scamming from everyone in her path, that I hated her.  So what that she's hot?  Was her hotness supposed to offset what a terrible person she really is?

Ben Affleck plays a shaggy, stupid bartender who somehow tends bar in a Marriott or some upscale place--obviously a place that would never hire an unkempt moron like him.

There's a workplace plot that involves a character getting his privates mutilated and the impending lawsuit that could upset the sale of the company.  Then there's a domestic plotline of a husband setting his wife up for adultery that has absolutely nothing to do with the workplace plotline...and none of this would matter if the film was remotely funny.

You'll see a lot of good reviews here but look for the key words, like ""understated.""  That means that the movie is ""not funny.""  ""Subtle.""  ""Not funny.""

So, just pour in the wet ingredients, then the dry, then hit the ""whole wheat"" setting on the breadmaker (1.5 pound loaf), and 3:45 later, fresh whole wheat bread!

I use this bread every day for my sandwiches. Just slice some in the morning (I store it in a large Ziploc bag), and several hours later I'm eating a super fresh sandwich. Even though the bread is a ""honey wheat"", I taste no honey in it, and it's definitely NOT sweet. This is a good thing, as I wouldn't want sweet bread to use for sandwiches.

The bread keeps very well in a ziploc bag for roughly 10 days. It may not rise as much as some other wheat breads you buy in the store, but it's still adequate for sandwiches and very tasty. I tried the whole grain white bread, and it rose twice as high as the wheat, making it impossible for me to fit into a bag!

The only complaint I've had is the way Amazon has played with the price. When I got it the loaves cost roughly one dollar, and now they're close to three dollars. So if you get lucky, it can be very economical to use this instead of buying commercial, processed bread.

218,"If you're an Elizabeth Boyle fan but feel that she is perhaps a tad too historically accurate in her characters' behavior and speech and that her plots and characters are not silly, superficial and one-dimensional enough, then this Lynsay Sands book is the one for you.  I'm pretty sure Sands wasn't even intending for this HR to have any ""historical"" in it, but why then bother to throw words like ""aye"", ""'tis"" and ""'twas"" into the dialogue as if attempting some kind of period speech?  Just leaving it all modern would have worked better for me.

The plot is a farce and I'm sure it was meant to be so, but somehow instead of finding it LOL funny, I just found it to be silly.  It also is full of more holes than Swiss cheese and is so simplistic that if it weren't for the several hot sex scenes, I would have thought it was a book intended for 15-year-old girls.

The characters are appealing in a one-dimensional, cartoonish way, but I like a little more depth in character and plot.  The three sisters in the book (1800s England is the setting, I believe) are named Chrissy, Suzette and Lisa.  'Nuff said.

What I hated: except that she drug out a high school drama/comic/tragedy for how many pages????

And then there are those books that scream at you and each word tumbles into your soul and fills you up and has you turned inside out and outside in and whispers to your heart and thats when a book turns into something much more than just a book... Kennedy Ryan is a mastermind when it comes to joining words together to make a story ( that is so much more than just a story its a journey). She takes your heart with her hands and pumps her words through you and breaks your heart because the words the words are so much more they are jagged pieces that cut they are real and their edges will cut.. and then she takes that same heart she just shredded and puts it back together.

I don't know if they ran a bad batch or if some dogs reacted to an ingredient that was sourced from a different supplier when they made it, but there does not appear to be any difference in the formula from what I can see on the labels of the 38.5 size bage and this newly packaged size of 35 pounds. The ingredients listed are identical, if I was to guess why this new listing for a 35 pound bag and the 38.5 pound  bag being ""out of stock"" now is their way to get away from people reading how this formula made a lot of dogs sick over the past 4-5 months when people read the most recent reviews.

My dogs all ate it up like it was candy, none appeared ill after wards, bowels were a bit softer as I did not transition them, I wanted to see if it made any of them sick. At first I only gave a little, then I gave them a full meal when 8 hours had passed and I saw no negative reactions. Then I gave them it for 2 days and so far all is good.
I think that whatever the problem was they fixed it.  BUT ALWAYS read the most recent reviews on any dog food as so many have been recalled due to  changes in formulas or who supplied the manufacturer with the ingredients..
I do not like the way they went about it, I would rather the mnfr commented and told how they resolved the issue and was above board but regardless it appears that this one is good to go now, All my dogs liked it and its nutritional value is in keeping with the other dog foods that have grain in them, you will pay  a LOT more for the grain free types.",3,"[0.6101111584394416, 1.0496213582579386, -0.8018411910329811, -1.0137079639114148, -1.5286824937494923]",1.0496213582579386

I finished this book days ago and I still don't know how to write this review. I have never read E.K. Blair before, but I will be checking out some of her other books, she is a phenomenal writer. As for the story I am torn, I've been aggravated by it and I can't figure out why. Why did Anonymous need her story told? Why didn't she just write it, as fiction. Why is the ending the way it is? On some very out of this world level I can almost, ALMOST relate to her story, where it started. It's hard being a mom and wife, we lose ourselves very easily. So when we get ANY kind of positive attention towards us, the woman we have long forgotten it feels nice, amazing even. But then you remember who you are, what you have, and how hard you worked to get there. From the story there wasn't anything really in her life that should have made her so unhappy to go as far as she did. I am not judging her, I am not mad at her nor do I hate her. I am just not understanding how she went that far with everything she had. There were parts of the story that made no sense to me, parts I didn't quite understand why they were there. I had a slew of different emotions while reading, E.K. Blair did an amazing job pulling me in, connecting me to the story, and making me feel things. Things I didn't want to feel sometimes. As far Anonymous' best friend in the story, I am shocked, I can sort of see why she would be there and support her but at the same time I think to myself I could never ever watch my best friend self destruct, live that way, and not try my damndest to get her help. Make her understand. Do something, anything besides be there. As far as the ending goes I am baffled. Why did the story just stop? Is she still living in limbo?

It's easy to fill the container with water, and cleanup has to be done weekly at least to remove the calcium and other gunk that builds up in the heating basin but it isn't difficult. The thing that makes me knock off a few stars, it isn't consistent.

Now fans of the author and the series will probably not like the three stars but, and this is just MY opinion, three stars mean I don't like it and I don't hate it.  I'm neutral.  It doesn't put the book down but it doesn't also 'lift' the book up.  Does that make sense?

Admission:  I did not read anything in the series prior to this book.  I know that's like putting the cart before the horse but this book is supposed to be a book in itself and not have to rely on its predecessors.  I didn't find myself lost, personally.

The book is pretty steamy and focuses on Cassie and Dauphine. Cassie, more or less, is Dauphine's guide.  You see, the SECRET society is a place to help people/women jumpstart their sexuality (what a concept!).  This book is not for the meek or mild-mannered person because there is quite a bit of erotica, and it's written very well.  As I write this, I've changed my mind from a 3 to a 4 star.

4050,"When I read the blurb for this story, I thought it would be right up my alley. I love dark stories and captivity themes are among my favorites. So, the story of a girl kidnapped and forced into sexual slavery sounded like a guaranteed dark success.

Unfortunately, this book fell flat for me. The characters seemed completely disconnected from the events taking place in the story. When they did have any type of reaction to the events transpire get, it was disproportionate and, at times, inappropriate for the situation.

For example, there is one scene where the heroine, ""Silver"", has supposedly just been brutally gang-raped and instead of the expected emotional turmoil and distress, she is savoring chocolate cake. Seriously? That scene was paired with the anecdotal comment that ""chocolate fixes everything"". Well, thanks for that pearl of wisdom, but I'm pretty certain that chocolate does not fix everything!

The detachment between the main characters emotions and the events taking place in the story made the entire story unbelievable. It just didn't ring true. Sometimes the emotions seemed rushed, or force-fed to the reader. Other times, the characters seemed to lack any of the expected, appropriate emotions for the given situation.

There were also a fair amount of grammatical mistakes in this book. If there hadn't been other issues with the execution of the plot, I could have overlooked this. However, as it is, the grammatical errors just proved to add more irritation.

Overall, I give this story 2 1/2 stars. The premise was promising, but the execution was lacking. The story was not as dark as I'd expected, with only a few ""darkish"" scenes. The characters were not compelling and failed to sell the story. Instead, the story comes across as unbelievable, and at times laughable.",2,"[0.21786476658806664, 1.009667757482096, -0.6314163939281827, -1.0166158763616824, -1.7315221990315555]",1.009667757482096

I didn't feel the love nor the suspense. Was it because of my state of mine? Could be. Anyway, I could only rate those two stories as 3 stars top (leaning to 2.5, really). However, the third book was very interesting. I love it when the kick-ass guy was a girl (eh, okay, bit confusing there, but you know what I mean). Honestly, I was a bit disappointed because the hero was still some kind of kick-ass guy (former force recon, grew up tough, etc). Why should he be like that? Why can't he be some genius computer mogul with kind heart who needed real physical protection from a kick-ass girl? Well, one can only hope.

7858,"This is a very cool mattress. Like others, I was very surprised to find the mattress arrived in an elongated package. It was quite heavy, but my UPS man had the worst of it, carrying it in from the truck. I was able to get it in my living room without much difficulty. This mattress is for my guest bedroom up a flight of stairs. I took the rolled up mattress out of the cardboard box and was able to cart it up the stairs with assistance from a teenaged neighbor. We put the mattress on the bed, the correct side up, and let it unfurl. It took a couple of days for the mattress to regain its full shape. I opened a window for an hour to allow the smell to dissipate.

The mattress is made of stretch knit with a fleur de lie design. I waited a few more days before I made the bed with sheets and top quilt. My son came for the weekend, and he slept on the mattress. His report is that it is very comfortable, with good support. He prefers a queen size bed, but this full mattress will be perfect for most people. There is a 12"" profile memory foam and innerspring mattress. It feels good to the touch. There is also a cool gel layer. The pocketed coils prevents motion and movement being noticed by a partner. Getting in and out of bed will not awaken your partner, unless they are a light sleeper.

The ease of set up was impressive for me. I have always had people deliver the mattress, and set it up. I will give the other mattress away and list it on my city's list serve. Comfort and support are the most important aspects of any mattress, and this one fits the bill.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 02-11-15",3,"[0.9855444289233184, 0.0981395964707723, -1.4573228153520492, -1.0260600559551103, -1.1248744254691307]",0.9855444289233184

9191,"I was always under the impression that this film was a comedy. I was very mistaken, but I enjoyed the film anyway. Aside from that false judgement, I was biased against the movie because of the era in which it was made. As a classic film fan, it is sometimes difficult not to resent some of the films that helped Hollywood progress away from the traditions of the classic era. However, any way you look at this movie, it is hard not to recognize the quality of the story and of the actors' performances.

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a film about a man Randle (Jack Nicholson) who is sent to a mental institution to be evaluated because of his behavior in jail. The doctors think he could be faking insanity in order to avoid the rest of his jail time, but he keeps them guessing with strange behavior. Randle becomes friends with the men in the ward, a diverse group including a young man with a stutter named Brad Dourif (Billy Bibbit), a deaf and dumb Indian called Chief (Will Sampson), a rigid man named Harding (William Redfield), and a hyperactive Italian called Martini (Danny deVito). Randle helps these men to fight back against the abusive power of the nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) causing trouble for everyone but giving them a sense of idenity and happiness.

This is a long film, but it is very emotional and powerful. Nicholson makes his character likable but appropriately flawed. Dourif presents his character innocently and sweetly like a little brother one needs to protect. Sampson is excellent as the Chief, one of the most interesting characters in the film. The ending to the movie is unsettling and sad, but it is thought-provoking and a wonderful finish to this film.",3,"[0.9850776601220199, -0.20649016024646227, -1.0077787515542238, -1.019505624907397, -1.4660939561459663]",0.9850776601220199

Halves and pieces. Hmmmm. Where and how do they get all the broken cashews? I couldn't find a single non-broken one. Oh well, I guess that's truth in labeling. But, how do they all get broken?

9373,"Old Boy was the first Korean film I have ever seen. I must say I am completely taken aback by the concept. I've lost count of the number of times in this film when I experienced EXTREME GOOSEBUMP SYNDROME.

I know I will never watch a film like Old Boy again but I do know it will reflect in my future conversations. I am not even ashamed of downloading this film. Atleast I watched it.

This film is about revenge and has more suspense filled raw staggering control over the viewer than I can possibly comprehend in my little review. The story is about as unique as the design of the wonders of the world. The movie covers a lot of aspects of a man's life. What value does time have? Do we really forget everything we know? Do elevators actually have passwords for the penthouse right on top? Do men actually have a remote control controlling their life support?

Now now, I know how vague and random I might sound but Old Boy actually did this to me. It is the most potent display of human thought I have seen in a long time. I remember watching ""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind"" and being disappointed not by the story but by the frail enactment. ""Old Boy"" contains more thought and hardcore action than quite a few movies put together. It leaves most behind in terms of quantity of mind.

I don't want to start with the actors and storylines because I do not want to ruin it for you. My favourite character in the film was the villain. The movie seems way ahead of it's time. At first, the subtitles didn't really help but soon I got used to it and by the end, they only helped more and more.

Old Boy keeps becoming more interesting as it grows. When it ended, I had my hand on my mouth and my eyes just about as wide as to make me look uglier.

3139,"Time marches on and another Pendergast novel hits the streets.  Unfortunately this one appears to primarily recycle characters that occasionally disappear and randomly reappear at convenient times.  Constance Greene is elevated to a main character, Proctor is fleshed out significantly, and even the busy-body Mrs. Trask has some meat added to her bones.  Howard Longstreet is introduced as an FBI investigator along with a backstory that ties in with that of our intrepid Special Agent.  And we are introduced to a female villain whose heart and mind reminds us of the dearly departed Diogenes.  But Aloysius, the slender white specter in the black suit, finds himself fully occupied elsewhere, joining the fray mid-point in the story.

There is no reason for me to tell you the story that other reviewers have already alluded to, especially since many of them have included spoilers that can ruin your hunches of where the action will lead.  But for some reason the story itself and its presentation seemed 'tired' to me, almost like the  authors had to really be creative and tried to wring out everything they could involving the characters and their interactions with each other.  Could it be that they simply 'tried too hard'?  Or, perish the  thought, has the Pendergast series finally worn itself out?

I have spent many (MANY) hours reading the works of these two authors, hours full of mystery, intrigue, unorthodox and imaginative crime solving, and the development of unique and complicated characters who have piqued my interest and entertained me time and time again.  The authors' writing remains the same, clear and concise, eloquent without being flowery, replete with subtle (and sarcastic) humor, taking the reader on a trip full of twists and turns that eventually arrives at a complicated ending -- usually one leaving the reader twisting in the wind until the next novel picks up the frayed ends.

Throughout the entire book I just didn't care about their issues, love life, problems whatever.  The author can't write well enough to make me care.  So Mom is kidnapped. Daughter is distraught.  I don't really care about the daughter.  Next we meet Mom who is being tortured.  How I can listen to a person being tortured & have no feelings about it other than boredom is beyond me.  There are no emotions.  Nothing gripping.  It just isn't there.  Another character, the poor tortured soul good guy (who apparently is sexy though I never felt the sexy).  Then we have our scary bad ass bad guys - um right.  Not scary.  I don't worry about Mom, daughter or anyone else while they deal with these so called bad ass criminals; not the cops, not the neighbors, not the kids, nobody.

Then the grand finale!  The explanation behind EVERYTHING!  I just didn't care.  So that's why this that & the other thing happened.  That's nice.  So what.  Are we done yet?

7340,"Bitches Brew (1970) is one of the real gems in the extensive Miles Davis discography. Why? After the incredible In a Silent Way from a year earlier, Davis continues his experimentation with avant-garde and fusion, but this time with a bolder and darker sound that really contrasts his work from In a Silent Way. Perhaps the most noteworthy aspect of this recording is its spontaneity; basically, the band more or less picked up their respective instruments and started playing. It's this unusual approach which makes Bitches Brew stand out. While listening, one can quickly conclude that the band was doing a long and spontaneous jam session, as some sounds don't mesh 100%. Still, this recording maintains a certain charm and appeal, despite its rawness. I'm not a jazz expert (especially with knowledge of song structures), but can safely say that Bitches Brew is loose, and purely meant to be transitional and trailblazing. Miles' trumpet is exceptionally loud on this one, and can really dominate at times. In summary, this album is for the open-minded audience, and for those who embrace something very out of the ordinary. This album is reflective of the late 60s, for sure.",4,"[0.9654764793007944, -1.0219285207045428, -0.8817173530064496, -1.02800488128576, -1.2945619685525263]",0.9654764793007944

546,"I had given up on Scarpetta books completely. Then I was given this one in audio for my birthday. I let it sit for over 6 months and then found myself without a book to read on audio when I made my morning walk. I fired up this book. The Shark (ala the Happy Days story when Fonzie jumped a shark and you knew the series had run out of gas) has been jumped again. I guess these latest books sell but I cannot figure out why.

Kay: Always mad, morose, depressed
Lucy: Always mad, still lesbian and still an unloveable person.
Marino: Not the same guy anymore.
Benton: Better off dead and I think he knows it.

I honestly tried to complete this book. The narrator is bad but I hung in there. I finally gave up today. Did not make it to the finish when I realized that I did not care what happened. The author is now filling pages with telling the reader what happened in other books: Kay's problem with Marino, Lucy's money, Benton's fake death, Kay's firing and on and on and on. Just write a mystery like you used to!

I congratulate anyone that made it to the finish. I hope Kay got killed to take her out of her misery. Anyone need a good condition CD?

643,"I can't say exactly what drew me to this book in the first place. It's not my typical read, but the title sucked me in with promises of Houdini facing off with the great medium of his time.

I wasn't disappointed.

The writing flowed well and kept me captivated. The story is wildly interesting. I had no idea that spiritism was such a big thing in America and that such prominent names were involved with it.

More than once, I got a bit freaked out after finishing a chapter. The seances could be quite spooky to read about and I can only imagine how much spookier they were for the people experiencing them. Even though mediums were routinely exposed as false and their tricks discovered, that didn't diminish the eerie feeling that permeated throughout the book.

When it comes to complaints about the book, I have only one. It was too long.

The historical account was enough to raise the hair on the back of my neck and make my arms break out in goosebumps. But it took so long to get anywhere with the story that I got frustrated. There are a lot of in-depth backstory about people that don't have much, if any, relevance to the story.

Length aside, The Witch of Lime Street is fabulous. It's a well-researched and fascinating account of a time in our history when science and spiritism nearly joined hands.

Excellent story and writing. Great build and pace with really nice details. Loved the changing POV's, both Will and Hanna each have a great voice. Loved the laugh-out-loud funny moments and there was a nice amount of sexy times too. Will and Hanna are always so playful and I love getting to see that side of them in full force. There was also a nice bit of angst, drama, and emotion happening and I loved how it was a touch more serious and seeing how they handled it. There were major changes happening and I had this ""awww, they're all grown up"" feeling happening. It was awesome! This was a really well rounded, fun story to read and it just made my heart happy.

Love when all the couples get together. They've forms such great friendships and they're own little family and I enjoy all their interactions and personalities. It was all so entertaining. It was fun seeing George again too... he was in one of my favorite scenes! Seriously hysterical!

This was just an awesome read. Totally entertaining and sexy! A definite five star read for me and an excellent addition to the Beautiful Bastard series. I so love Bennett, Chloe, Max, Sara, Will and Hanna so much! Player Will be in my heart forever!

This is a FABULOUS CHRISTmas read and if you've followed the series it CAN NOT be missed!!!!!!!  Focusing more on sweet kids instead of the animals this time, I truly enjoyed all of these characters!  There's a touch of suspense in the mix with this one and a touch of gritty reality that has been flowing through this whole series!  This story is about change, hope, family, and love!  What a year these siblings have been through!!!!  Completing the four siblings tales, Levi picks up the plot and finds what his siblings have already found!  Continuing also with Tess I really LOVED her stories continuation!  There's a scene where she and another character are so open and honest about what they are feeling!  I LOVED it!  It is so refreshing among the suspense and turmoil of hidden secrets and feelings from other characters!  With the characters coming together in REALLY GREAT scenes and their pasts colliding with their present, this is a highly entertaining read and became one of my favorites of the series!

The ending was awful. This was a free book; I'm not paying to see what happened. Oh well, it was pretty short so I didn't waste THAT much time. As far as the book now, it started like wildfire--like the gun shot off and the horses started running. Had me hooked right from the beginning. But as I read, it became more and more sexual, almost pornographic. I like a little romance but it seemed like all they did was have sex- in your face, very graphic sex. But I wanted to see who Petra ended up with so I kept reading (not knowing it continues in another book). There were some lol moments for me with some of the things she said but other than that, it couldn't make up for the overabundance of sex. It just didn't seem believable to me and they never gave you HIS p.o.v. So I don't know if he was real or just acting. I really wanted to see what was up with Adrian, her high school crush but alas, that went unresolved too. If you're into fun, gratuitous sex, you'll like this book.

Layla has had it with dating football players!! She still in a funk after her recent break up with Quarterback Callum Worthington after he was busted cheating on her.  She decides a road trip to her family lake house with her bestie Poppy is exactly what she needs!!
She doesn't expect for her brother, Finn, to be there with his super hot friend and teammate Branch Best. Finn let Branch now right away that his sister is strictly off limits!!
After endless flirting between Layla and Branch for the last couple of days, Finn and Poppy end up leaving for a trip to town.  One thing leads to another and things end up getting hot and heavy between Layla and Branch.  Layla knows not to get attached because Branch was upfront about how he never gets in relationships because of the schedule involved with playing football.  She can definitely handle having a weekend fling. Plus, she's over dating football players!! Things get crazy when Finn finds out amongst other surprises!! I loved this fast paced read!!

2663,"As opposed to the majority of the reviewers here I didn't like this book.
For me the writing was extremly flat. Perhaps my receiver is jammed but I just couldn't feel any of those sentiments other reviewers could. The words, sentences were there but they didn't convey any emotions for me. I didn't feel the love between the characters, I was only told they loved each other but was unable to feel it. The story itself wasn't bad but the execution failed.
The writing felt as passionate as a handshake with a stranger in the office or a news report about economic trends in my daily newspaper.
On the other hand I understand not every writing style is for everyone. So despite not feeling the romance with my 3 stars I appreciated the work of the author. The characters, their backgrounds and the storyline were thought-out, technically speaking the writing was good (in terms of grammar and editing).
This book was my second attempt with this author and after experiencing the same reservations I think its time to admit defeat and move to greener pastures.

5421,"The Fight of Our Lives: Knowing the Enemy, Speaking the Truth, and Choosing to Win the War Against Radical Islam is a very thought provoking book.

If you are even remotely PC, I can almost guarantee that this book will offend you.  It takes a sledgehammer and hits you square between the eyes with fact after fact about how the country is looking the other way at this issue.  Why is that?  Are we afraid to confront it?  Are we afraid of offending people in this country?  Read the book and find out for yourself, so I don't spoil it for you. :)

I was shocked to learn of the ""look the other way"" mentality, or ""we don't want to offend anyone"" with regard to the Ft. Hood shooter and how our administration continues to refuse to call it what it is:  Terrorism. Radical Islamic Terrorism. And yes, there is plenty of blame to go around for each political party.

The reality is simple: if we continue to bury our head in the sand on this issue and concede every time the country is challenged we might as well bury our founding documents right along with it.

. The plot centers around Mort Angel, who gives up a good paying job as an IRS agent because a) It is boring and b) he didn't like ""grim silences at parties"" when he said he was an IRS agent. The idea that someone would give up a job paying $60,000 a year because strangers disapproved is ludicrous.

1657,"The Library at Mount Char is an oddity of a book.  It's a mix of genres, mostly fantasy and thriller, but with a story arc that's a bit tricky to pin down and characters that I found difficult to connect with.  Let me put it this way, if chapter one doesn't hook you or simply horrifies you, that's a good place to stop.  I powered on and kind of wish I hadn't.  It's not so much that I did not like the book, more that there was not a clear sense of direction most of the time.  Between the chapters there are often interludes that fill in some character's back story, but two of the characters seem thrown into the text without a sense of direction for much of the first half.  They also seemed very much two sides of the same coin, so despite their differences, the purpose of them was oddly similar.

The second half unravels much of what the first half builds, but even that is not entirely satisfactory and goes walkabout bogging down the narrative.  Much of the story comes through dialogue which keeps the pace up but doesn't always give solid answers to questions.  I'm still not sure what the purpose of the story was or who the main character is meant to be at the end.  The description from the publisher does not exactly match what Scott Hawkins delivers in this book.  There are complex ideas that never fully coalesce and plenty of times that events stretch belief even within the fantasy setting.  Basically, one needs to suspend disbelief the moment the book starts or it comes out a hodge podge of genres and ideas that don't untangle.

I had to DNF at 58% because I was wondering, what now? They said their I-love-yous and even their good-byes, so what's next? And was I even curious to find out?

The answer seems to be no.

A book friend told me I'd love the chick. Mehhhh, not really. She's an odd one but not because of being an ex-thief or her secret, but that's how she comes off. She often says pointless things, randomly spits them out and I'm scratching my head, wondering how that was relevant to the story, in any way?

And let's not get into how unlike-able the hero is. He's actually repulsive and if I had to share a house with him, I'd clobber him with the frying pan, daily. Because yes, the a-hole jerk deserves no less.

But anyway, I felt zero connection to the characters, the story. I'm confused as to what's it about. The heroine's secret? The hero's secret? An important Southern family's secret? Again, I'm pondering on how some things are relevant to the story because I just don't get it. It's the first time I've read a book by this author, I have no idea how her other stories are, but this one didn't sell me on wanting to read them.

2742,"Too Bad To Die is described as a WWII thriller in which British Naval Intelligence officer Ian Fleming races to foil a Nazi plot to assassinate Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin at the Tehran Conference. Since I am a big fan of historical thrillers and especially those set during WWII, I was certain Too Bad To Die was going to be a big hit with me.

To its credit, I enjoyed the rich historical detail Francine Mathews packs into her latest book, and I learned a lot about many of those people who were world leaders and influencers of those leaders during WWII.

Unfortunately, however, I felt that Mathews spent so much of her book packing historical details into it that they overshadowed her ability to tell a tense and enthralling thriller. For me, Too Bad To Die moved at such a slow pace that by the time any real thrills and actions occurred they were too little, too late. Further, while the tidbits about many of the 'real people' characters were interesting and, at times, juicy, Mathews' ability to present richly developed characters -- including her main character, Ian Fleming -- was just mediocre. As a result of these flaws, on several occasions I came very close to giving up on this book.

Ultimately, I'm glad I finished Too Bad To Die book because it turned out to be an okay read -- but a book that is just okay is not one I'd recommend you rush out to read. 2 1/2 stars rounded up to 3 stars.",2,"[0.789327616608644, 0.9180911500790732, -0.5169410752320424, -1.000689177999788, -2.180381251606888]",0.9180911500790732

593,"After traversing the ever expanding story arc of 2001, 2010, and 2061, the finale was a supreme letdown and major disappointment. Part of the tragedy lies in the evolution of science fiction writing itself. Contemporary sci-fi writers are much more nuanced, subtle, and sophisticated. While there is still some of the simplistic alien wars with bizarre lifeforms (usually for no reason), the majority of sci-fi writing today is for an educated, adult audience that includes exploration of societal organization and interpersonal relationships in addition to the standard advances in physics, biology, medicine, electronics, and computers.

3001 is written more in the style of pre-1950's sci-fi where the audience was primarily pre-adolescent boys. The science and technology is not terribly engaging. Clarke's philosophical meanderings are mostly a distraction to the story. One gets the impression that Clarke is frustrated that the future is not turning out as he originally envisioned. Finally, the expectation for some resolution of the monolith structures is left wanting. Clarke appears to be ""stuck"" in a time warp of old-fashioned (rather than classical) sci-fi writing style that is simply unsatisfying today.

For those looking for closure with the whole 2001 saga, by all means read 3001; it's relatively short and quite readable.",0,"[0.8938713536507752, 0.3004237419593485, -0.32619602718317897, -1.0159052572165088, -2.250558116570426]",0.8938713536507752

But even if it is more accurate than I think, it's still a bad book.  The characters and plot (such as it is) are trite and predictable, the dialogue likewise.  It's like ""Scrubs"" without the comedy (which was pretty good).

I have always liked and actually respected Sanjay Gupta, but he doesn't do himself any credit with this novelized version of ""General Hospital.""  I can only surmise that CNN and his other gigs aren't paying him well enough, or at least not as much as he thinks he deserves.

However, besides all that - and an unforgivable sin in my book - the book is sloppily put together, and the editor needs to have an eye (or brain) exam (presumably Dr. Ty Wilson could do the latter).  It is replete with typos, beginning in the early pages (the word ""sections"" appears where the context makes it clear that it should be ""seconds"") and continuing throughout.

Although the design of all crates are basically the same, this crate's latches and hooks caught on other parts of the crate so it required more maneuvering and finagling to get each panel into place. Maybe it's because the box was pretty banged up when it arrived so some pieces felt slightly bent. Also, it felt less sturdy and finished than the iCrates. Don't get me wrong, it's still a perfectly fine and serviceable crate; I guess I've become used to the ease of setting up our iCrates for my fosters. Price wise, this crate tends to run a bit cheaper than the similar sized iCrate, so that's a point in the AmazonBasics crate's favor. I also really like having the versatility of two doors, but if you're only looking for a single door, this is a good option.

My daughter uses the i-Pod, I don't even know how to download to it or get the music to key up, and I had this thing plugged up and playing in a few minutes. As far as the hardware itself, be careful, first of all, which i-Pod housing you use; once you get them clipped in, they are difficult to take out. And I, of course, chose the wrong one. The i-Pod she has is from China, so it's a slightly different size, yet it plugged in and worked fine, but it necessitated going without any housing at all. As far as sound, it's mediocre at best; it's great if you have nothing else and are using this for listening to something while you're doing something else (like having background music while you studying or mood/ambience music). But once you increase the volume on this, the sound gets distorted and fuzzy, rather than able to keep it's clarity as the sound goes on up. I listen to metal and hard rock, so this is definitely not my kind of system. My daughter, however, thinks it's fine, as does my wife. They listen to instrumental, pop, and various vocalists compilations and tend to talk over their music sometimes. To be frank, it's not hard to talk over this system.

Why not 4-stars?  The effort to include Vincent D'Agosto was painful.  There was no reason to include that character here at all.  Also, the inclusion of two other characters was all set-up material for a future book, and had no business being in this book.

Any other highlights?  Pendergast is always an unusual protagonist who manages to come up with very creative solutions to difficult problems.  The pacing and dialogue were superb.

But you did like the book, right?  I enjoyed it a lot.  It's just not as good as it could have been, and should have been.",2,"[0.8582871468699516, 0.6324621957476451, -0.38110158242344894, -1.0046329713024063, -2.0983430408737913]",0.8582871468699516

However right after we put it down we had very heavy rain shower the following morning. We had applied it as directed but when we went out to check on it, it was totally washed away! Not only were the sloped areas that one would expect rinsed clean but the flatter barren area had washed out into the grassy area that didn't need  to be reseeded!

In hindsight if I were to use this ""self mulching"" seed again, not only would I scratch up the surface like I did, I would also add some topsoil on top to have something with more weight hold it in place and scattered some straw on top like we did when we originally seeded our lawn after building our house, to give it a bit more insurance that is would stay where we planted it! We did not have this issue when we used the scratched up surface and liberally scattered straw over the seeds. This ""mulch"" part of this product did not hold up to the rain in our situation.

7477,"Once upon a time, an SLR came with a 50(ish) mm ""standard"" lens with a maximum aperture of somewhere in the f 1.4-2.0 range. Today a 28-70mm (or digital equivalent) zoom is usually kitted with an SLR. This has a maximum aperture generally in the f 4.0-5.6 range. That's something like 1/2 to 1/4 the light gathering ability, and often considerable optical quality, given away in exchange for cheap zooms.

If you're looking at this, then you've probably decided on a 50mm or so prime lens, likely because the kit zoom lens is both slow and not very good quality. Here are the options for Canon:

Canon 50mm f/1.8 (version 2): It's inexpensive, very fast compared to any cheap zoom and exceptionally good for the price. On the down side, it's cheap feeling, noisy in focusing, and difficult to focus manually. You should buy at least this.

Canon 50mm f/1.4: A little bit faster, but that's a less important trait these days with good digital high effective ISOs. More importantly, it's robust, easy to use, with full-time manual focusing (you can just grab the ring even when it's autofocusing), and good image quality

Sigma 50mm f/1.4: More expensive than the Canon lens, but slightly better image quality wide open. It's a tough sell since the quality change isn't huge. But if the extra money and Sigma logo don't bother you, then go for it.

Canon 50mm f/1.2: Big money for that extra light-gathering ability. If you need this for photographing in a club, then you'll buy it. If you don't need it, it's too expensive and heavy to compete with the lenses above.

Another, used, option, the original Canon 50mm f/1.8 EF lens was sturdier and better built, but they're only available used and possibly abused. I own one and am happy with it. I have shot with the Canon f/1.4 as well and that's the lens that I'd buy today.",4,"[-0.9163460691101384, 0.8493598265425706, -0.6129412377075126, -0.9907009247176608, -1.6147379477097035]",0.8493598265425706

When an heiress disappears in 1917, her cousins are next in line to inherit. Seven years after her disappearance, an uncle discovers an actress who looks just like the missing Jessie. He wants her to pretend to be Jessie and claim the fortune.

At first Leah refuses. But after losing her vaudeville gig and finding few prospects of work, she agrees.

Then, as she gets into the role, she realizes Jessie didn't disappear. She thinks the heiress was murdered. The obvious suspect is one of Jessie's cousins, and Leah sets out to unravel the truth. Even when she discovers other women have been murdered and might be connected to Jessie's disappearance, even when the greedy uncle threatens her--all he wants is for her to claim the money and disappear--she refuses to leave it alone.

The slang and events of the era seem true to form. The scattered mentions and use of well-known Vaudeville people who later emerged as big stars make things interesting (although I personally never like a story using a real person in a fictional situation).

Seven years later, her uncle, Oliver,  thinks he has found his answer when he sees a vaudville actress on stage who is Jesse's dead ringer. Problem is...it isn't her.  It is a young woman, Leah, who has been alone since the age of 12. Oliver comes up with a great idea that will allow him to take hold of Jesse's fortune. He will have Leah impersonate Jessie. There are some who aren't happy to see Jesse back though.

My rating: 4 Stars

My opinion: Ms. Miley offers a stunning example of why I love the freshness of debut authors so much.

The storyline in this book was so unique, well developed and intriguing. Given the time period that the book is set in, one can actually see this occurring and have been offered times in history when it has occurred. Ms. Miley includes the famous weaved into her storyline which was thrilling. It was just a fun, fun read!

Gotta admit that the ending left me in surprise, which is always a nice thing for me. Not necessarily a book with a lot of twists, per se, but a well developed plot that didn't release too much too soon.

You will hear a little background noise, but only if you do not have anything playing. The instructions say to turn the volume all the way down before you first use the earphones then slowly turn it up. Remember to do this. You will not have to turn the volume up as high as you would normally.

I admit that I have trouble using bud earphones; they don't fit right and tend to hurt my ears. These did too. To me, they feel like they are about to fall out of my ear. I tried the other rubber covers that come with the earphones and that helped. But just having them in my ears had my ears hurting after a short amount of time.

They are good earphones. But, if you have trouble using normal bud earphones, then I doubt that these will feel comfortable to you, but if you don't, you will probably absolutely love them.

Keeper is a beautifully heart wrenching and exquisitely soul resurrecting journey.  After I read the Harris brothers books it leaves me with a huge smile on my face. I think Booker is my favorite so far out of the Harris brothers. I love their fun, flirty, sexy banter and oh god the British accents. The audible version is AWESOME!  You have to listen to it. Will M. Watt & Charlotte Cole are just perfection, best narration I have heard to date. If I could give more than 5 stars I would. This is a second chance story.

It is as addictive as any video game and has just as much replay value.

The story concerns Wade Watts, user name Parzival, an overweight, poor, and nerdy video game enthusiast who wants to win the OASIS contest. OASIS is a completely immersive console game that many people use as a second life, a way to be the person they cannot be in life. The creator of the OASIS has just died, and he willed his $240 billion fortune to the first person to find the series of Easter eggs in the OASIS. After five years, no one has even found the first part, but that is all about to change. And the results of the contest seem steeped in the favor of the Sixers, the nickname for the employees of an oppressive company that wants to mold the OASIS to suit their desires, which would keep poor players like Parzival out.

Since the creator of the OASIS grew up in the 80s, and the seekers of the fortune have made the decade second nature in hopes of using the knowledge to win, this book is packed with references from music to games to movies like Wham!, Joust, Dig Dug, PacMan, WarGames, Star Wars, Revenge of the Nerds, The Breakfast Club, Back to the Future, Highlander, Ghostbusters, Risky Business, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Red Dawn, Beastmasters, Night Rider, etc. If you like any of these, you'll love this book.",4,"[0.7907595177842865, -0.12148952875630825, -1.2762455009575469, -1.0315028045764243, -1.4815508928546994]",0.7907595177842865

She is an author that I continually suggest to my reader friends, because she writes her characters and stories in such a way, that makes them just come to life right I front of your eyes!  This book is my second favorite book, with Let Love Heal being my first.  That's not to say that this story is any less powerful and passionate...it's just that the main character of LLH struck such a personal chord for me.  Let Love Be is a MUST READ for those who have lost hope in ever finding another one true love.  Once again, Melissa brings you right into the lives of the characters in her book and teaches about great friendship, strong family units, unyielding love, passion, and faith, and tremendous courage in all of life's unseen paths.  Are there love scenes?  Yes there are, and once again, Melissa doesn't disappoint.  With Reid and Maddie there were all the awkward ""firsts"".  Melanie and Bryan dealt with all the awkward moments that stem from low ""self-image"".  Finally, with Lucy and Bryan, you learn that over 40 just makes the love that more strong and passionate...and they get it JUST RIGHT!  If you have not read any of Melissa's books, then may I suggest that you put the book that you're reading now down...right this minute and begin reading her books.

6565,"This is the kind of plot that makes me drool Let's say that metaphorically or I'll spook you ;o) Still...

Hitman.
(My muscles were clenching)

A boss' daughter that has the hots for him, but is untouchable.
(Me wants this right now)

Dangerous man, forbidden woman, bullets and sparks everywhere.
(Oh, yeah, I'm sold, packed and on my way to dark romance heaven!)

The plot was hard and unforgiving. The relationship between Silas and Fawn seemed doomed. Yay. Even the characters were interesting as he has a damaging past and she understands mafia life from inside. I wanted to know more about them when I reached the end.

From the first chapter with a bloody introduction to Sila's job as an assassin to the first encounters with Fawn and their harsh, hot, heart-pounding chemistry, this story had me enthralled.

It's dark, it's violent, it's as sexy as sin, and every scene was full of injustice, horrid mobsters, dangerous secrets as sharp as a knife and carnal excitement that will heat your body no matter where you are or who you are.

Expect to have crazy fun with a criminal syndicate steeped in debauchery and carnage, and find yourself deep in a world of vendettas, murder and the steamiest relationship ever between a bold, helpless and brave woman and her perfectly mind-blowing hitman.

I've read several novels by this author and always enjoyed them, eagerly waiting for the next release. This one, wow. It's really intense. A blood-curdling nemesis, a dark hero, a relentless heroine. More desperate sensuality that I could dream of, a strong narrative that made me crave the outcome as much as the protagonists. Any drawbacks? Let me think... too much oral gratification for the male character? ;o) I'll let you decide.

The novel is fantastic with a brutal plot and abundant sexy times. This new Bad Boy Empire series is going to be such a temptation!",4,"[0.7800890097939652, -0.8451659882529607, -1.3796798664785104, -1.0112827753735634, -0.994371181328845]",0.7800890097939652

I find it tedious when a person who has no investigative experience (a graphic artist) is suddenly off investigating crimes on his own, following really bad people into deep, dark woods where there is no cell phone reception.

  The story is pretty straightforward: Two L.A. Cops are brought to Alaska, ostensibly to help solve a murder, but the reality is they were sent away to get them out of the spotlight of an Internal Affairs investigation that could drag them both down. While trying to snare the killer, the stakeout goes horribly awry, and cop and killer become drawn together by the secret knowledge of what happened.
  The performances are great. Al Pacino, Robin Williams, Hilary Swank, and Nicky Katt are all great actors. The problem is, the story just doesn't seem compelling enough on it's own. The actors are the only thing sustaining interest. It's also riddled with bad-tv cliches: Evidence is found by accident, days after dozens of people turned the beach upside-down and found nothing, the killer opens a drawer in his house, allowing a cop to see evidence that can implicate him (oops!), Pacino even gets the location of Williams' hideout from the jacket of a book he'd written! Come ON.....sloppy writing!

The book is essentially a French Resistance hero wandering from place to place.  There were no nasty nazis on his tail for most of the book.  There were so many opportunities when some intrigue would have helped, but it seems that Furst didn't want to bother.  I think Furst has fallen into the abyss that so many popular writers have done: He's written all his good books, he's very rich, and he has neither the ability or desire to crank out first-class thrillers anymore.  I hope this isn't the case and I will give this book three -- instead of two -- stars because Furst is one of the best writers out there.

It has a refreshing minty taste with an odd lingering aftertaste.  This might be thanks to the stevia.  My dilemma is if this is worth the price.  The first ingredient is water.  On the nutrition panel none of the amino acids, vitamins, antioxidants, enzymes & minerals the bottle says aloe vera contains are listed.  Just sodium & sugar.  The lack of any nutrients on the nutrition facts makes me wonder if there is anything what so ever nutritional about Aloe Gloe.

My normal choice for aloe is by the brand Lily Of The Desert.  Their aloe juice is certified organic containing only 3 ingredients:  organic inner aloe leaf, citric acid & potassium sorbate.  On the nutrition facts it says it contains 25mg calcium, 4mg magnesium, 58ml aloe filet (aloe gloe on the other hand does not even say how much aloe is actually in the water!)

4722,"This book had a much different feel to me than this author's other work. Yes, it has a sexy lead male, intimate scenes that have you shifting in your seat, and many other aspects that we all love, but this one felt so much more personal. For me, Willow is an extremely relatable character. Pieces of her live in all of us. Even those that project confidence or conceit, have self doubt that can't be seen by others.

Willow struggles with her self worth and a 'family' that viciously feeds those insecurities. Her situation broke my heart, but the growth that followed gave me the warm and fuzzies. This book shows how determination and the love of others can give you the drive to overcome the inner battles we all face from time to time.

Kane... I struggled to find another word to describe him other than perfect. Because if this book teaches us anything at all, it's that no one is perfect. He's loyal, caring, gentle, patient, supportive, determined, and one of the most swoon worthy characters I have read in a long time. I love him, I'm going to keep him, and I'm going to make him mine forever....

Amanda Hocking is well known for selling, well ... quite a few self-published novels, but having not read any of them, I wasn't quite sure what to expect with Wake, the first book of a new trilogy.

I'm touch and go on stories with mermaids/selkies/sirens. They are so awkward to write about, to try to figure out logistics and such. I mean - it's not like you can actually be sexy with a fin for your lower half, right? So while I think Hocking did an admirable job trying to make this strange, mystifying race alluring, I think it all kind of got lost in a strange loops.

Because, honestly, I finished the book yesterday and here's what I remember about it: girl swims, girl falls for guy, sister falls for guy, girl swims, something bad, the end.

Was I entertained while reading Wake? Sure. I mean, I wanted to finish the book, it wasn't difficult to read, but it was a sort of morbid curiosity that ultimately led to me finishing it.

1528,"I have read (and loved) every single Fannie Flagg book ever published, and it pains me to give one of her books only 3 stars, but I just did not care for this book nearly as much as her previous novels. I think the main thing that turned me off was not understanding why exactly Margaret wanted to commit suicide in the first place. Because she's no longer Miss Alabama? Because she had an affair with a married man 40 years ago? Because she didn't marry her teenage sweetheart? All pretty weak reasons to drown yourself in a lake.

Another issue for me was how neat and clean everything was wrapped up. I realize all Fannie's novels have happy endings, and I look forward to that, but in this book it just felt forced and extremely far-fetched. Especially the surprise at the end. Funny how that all worked out. And I KNEW Babs would end up getting hers in the end, but it was all so rushed. Just a paragraph explained her downfall.

Also, while I liked Margaret, I certainly didn't love her. She was much more likeable though when compared to her 'friends' (with the exception of Hazel). Every time Margaret tried to broach the topic of cluing Brenda into her suicide plans, she would always ignore Margaret's silent plea and turn the conversation to herself. I thought it was extremely selfish and it really made me not like her.

Overall, I just did not love this book. It's been 4 years since Fannie's published a book, and this is the first time I've ever been disappointed with one of her novels.

My only complaint on the mounting would be that it would be nice if it was sized to fit in a standard drill, like 1 1/8 or 1/14 inch.  As it was, I drilled a 1"" hole, and opened it up with a dremel.  It's not pretty, but there is enough ""lip"" to the socket to cover the roughness of the hole, even without the rectangular piece (which pops right off, you don't need to use it).

Is it waterproof?  I washed the motorcycle after install, opened the lid, dry inside.  So it worked for that.  Would it survive a rain storm?  Hard to say for sure, but then I don't remember the last time I rode in heavy rain, so it's not an issue for me.

5432,"The blurb seriously UNDERSELLS this book. I was expecting a fairly lightweight and forgettable romance with main characters who were maybe a little selfish and that I might not really care for. Hands up I admit it, I was so wrong on all counts.

I got an AMAZING book with so much emotion it almost left me speechless. In fact now I have finished the story I have that lost feeling of needing more book. The intensity and depth of feelings drew me so deeply into this story that I didn't want to put it down. I just kept reading and reading. Lorelei James is a wondrous spinner of tales and I cared so much about what happened to Tate and Nathan. All the characters were well written and interesting - I need to know what happens with some of them too. The chemistry between the hero and heroine was so steamy hot I'm surprised my kindle didn't melt.

Tate and Nathan are both a little broken and this affects how they act with each other. They also harbour some secrets - and you can see this is going to cause problems later on for them. They don't even get really intimate until a good chunk of the way through the book - but the heat is there throughout. And the sex scenes are beautifully written, tasteful but hot.

I laughed, I swooned and yes I cried at this book. And there wasn't anything predictable about this book. Other than the fantastic writing the other thing that made this book superb was how real the characters and story line were, Nathan worked at the dirty end of construction. This book proves that you don't have to be a billionaire or sports star to be a hot, hot, hot hero.

I like a little erotica with my romance bordering on soft porn.  But this was straight out hardcore porn.  Same sex play, sharing and menage, as well as dual couple participation disguised as instruction or teaching lessons.  I thought this was going to be about Payton McCreary (23) quitting her job at a BDSM Club and finding her strength as she builds a new life for herself. Instead, it's about her finding passion and learning to trust while overcoming her fear of relationships.  It could've been a good story if it hadn't been overpowered with contrived reasoning to insert hardcore sex.  It became boring and tedious with one sex scene after another.  On top of all this, there's no reiteration through the story of what these two characters looked like other than Dom having aqua blue eyes.  Ms. Sloane...keep them alive in our minds!  Refresh. Reiterate. Repeat the characters details. Subtle reminders go a long way in forming a solid connection.  I never had any idea what Payton looked like other than her killer body.  No visual, no connection.  Anyway, all told from Payton's POV.  It would've been nice to hear from Dominics voice.  The controversy is forced, contrived, and ridiculous.  No turmoil.  No drama.

the movie itself, just like ellroy's novel, even it was deemed as the best of ellroy's, is so pretentiously noir, noir, overly noir, added some yellowish, brownish lens to imitate that era with chain-smoking people, hats...lousy background music that usually come with disney cartoons, ended this movie up in a messy shape.  not even you've read or re-read the novel first, you still didn't quite get it, no matter what and, couldn't have cared less.

411,"I hate to be a naysayer, but I truly do not understand the appeal of this book.  Old maids sit about pinching pennies (or farthings) poke their heads outdoors to frown on their neighbors and head back inside to grouse.  A reader of this review commented that some of the details (I considered them banalities) do indeed constitute spoilers and therefore I have deleted them from this edited version (12/5/11).

That same reader was kind enough to point out the history of the novel which explains its disjointed narrative and lack of cohesion.  Whille I understand better why it is such a tedious stinker, I am no more inclined to improve my opinion.  The book is nothing more than a multitude of the mundane strung together as plot.  Our narrator pops in and out of town on visits recording these banalities to what end?  A few instances made me smile, a skirmish between fans of Dr. Johnson and Dickens had some charm but for the most part the characters and their lives left me bored.  Some of the reviewers here have compared Gaskell to Austen.  Sorry but not even close.

5am.

I'm laying in bed, drinking my coffee.

Eyes start to sting

little *sniffle* here and there.

At this point I seriously want to crush Danielle Jamie. I don't know if in a huggy way or a ""I'm gonna kick your booty way"" Not even had my first full cup of coffee and the girl has me cryin. wtf. I'm not a crier. I don't cry at books. I don't. I know what happens to me when I cry. It's just not happening. Yea well. Danielle did it. It's her fault.

What an amazing story. Hands down, Danielle's best work to date. And that says a lot because I LOVE Kaden.

Brittan, struggling to move on with her life after a tragedy. The only thing that keeps her head above water is the memories she desperately holds onto. She moves around day to day, with all the things around her reminding her of what used to be. Nothing can bring her back. It's a swirling black hole out there plaguing her, and why should she move on? There's nothing for her out there. Her family doesn't get it, her friends don't understand. The only other thing she clings to other than the memories - music. It's the one thing, that one song that can define her, lift her, or break her.

A chance moment, a chance encounter brings Jordan Valentine into her life. She's in the right place at the right time. An electric charge unlike any before arch's between them. If she takes a step, she has to let go of the memories, doesn't she? Can she? Brittan takes a chance and buries her emotions, friends with benefits she can deal with, just leave her heart alone. Jordan takes what he can get knowing fully that Brittan's heart belongs to another.

Danielle Jamie has taken her writing to another level. She's a brilliant story teller, as we knew with The Savannah Series, but this? This is masterful. Phenomenal. Heartbreakingly, Hauntingly Beautiful.

The book seemed to jump all over the place with not much history around the characters. I'm not a huge fan of cheating spouses, so that kind of drug the book down for me with Enzo's character, but Dorian was also a bit of a jerk, and whole betting thing just turned me off. Kendall and Elroy just gave me the creeps, and their characters just kind of inappropriately fell into to story instead of being strategically written into the situation. The book was a bit long than what it needed to be given the storyline, I found myself jumping ahead to get past the parts that were being dragged out. The only redeeming factor with this book was the Epilogue, made the whole book for me, and given how long the book was, there should have been far more redeeming factors there.
