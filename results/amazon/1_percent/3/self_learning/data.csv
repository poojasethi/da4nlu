It features a slim design so it can fit in tight places. It lasts about four hours per charge and doesn't dim very much as the charge goes down.  Which leads me to the two things I dislike about it.  One, the unit I received for review flickers quite a lot, and it's VERY noticeable when working on objects near the light.  It tends to stop flickering near the end of the charge..  It's annoying, but it's possible I simply got a defective unit.  Second, there is no warning that I can detect when the charge gets low. The unit just turns off completely until you recharge it.  A pre-warning flashing red LED on the unit would be a big help to anticipate its impending shutoff.

I mean, despite what the blurb suggests, it doesn't even have a main character. What do you do with a book that doesn't have a main character or couple? What do you do? (As an aside, that blurb is totally inaccurate anyway.) There's no plot. The characters do everything from pine for one another to assassinations to buy a horse that randomly gets bitten by a snake. There's insta-lust and a relationship that goes from 0 to 4,000 in about a page. There is endless agonizing over if the characters are a couple yet and if they're gay or not, all in artificial and exaggerated ways. There's pointless past trauma that is too much to be believed.

There is telling, telling, telling about how wonderful and significant and 'I'll be with you forever even though we've been a couple for 2 days' the characters feel, all adding up to basically nothing. Nothing that happens is believable. None of the emotions read as believable, not even the lust (though that's not really an emotion, I suppose). These men are supposed to be super elite soldiers and assassins, but they agonize over everything like teenager, and I don't just mean the emo stuff (though that's non-stop from page one) but if a teammate gets injured or is doing his part of a mission out of sight or killing. All the things a highly trained soldier would take in stride (and we're told they do) they are shown to whinge about. And the technical aspect of these soldiers? ""...are you sure this little black box will disrupt them?"" Seriously, that's how they talk about their tech!

It's his most infamous because of a serial killer doing a Donald Duck impression and seeing a lot of women cut up in various gruesome and sick, sick ways.  The film has all the usual Fulci ingredients:  bad story, atrocious dialogue, bad dubbing (though I'm sure this would be a piece of garbage in Italian as well), crappy camera work, just all around unprofessional, tacky, and a complete waste of time.  I kick myself a lot when I decided ""I should give this guy a chance"", so I saw a lot of his films (too many), and I dread the name Fulci, as it is synonymous with ""worst films ever made"".

I think the BBFC did the larger viewing public a disservice when they classified this as a ""video nasty"" (and other Fulci works), because it made many people go out and seek it out.  They should have just let it slide through and labeled it ""mediocre, preposterously s****y, enormous toilet dropping of a movie"".  I sometimes think that because Fulci is so reviled by many that people assume he must be a genius that ""film snobs"" or ""elites"" don't get.  This isn't true at all.  He's just a really bad filmmaker who made a couple of decent films (Zombie is his most consistent), and upped the gore quotient in the horror genre.

At least that's how it should have gone. Unfortunately the recent '06 film `The Good Shepherd' falls far short of my pre-viewing expectations. It is exceedingly slow, too long and the farthest thing from being a thriller than one could imagine.

Was it a bit sweet and predictable?  Yes.  However, it had some extremely touching parts as well as a suprise or two thrown in.  As I neared the end of the book I realized that I would miss these characters, especially Lily.  I am not a fan of the romance genre, but this book pulled me in and kept me reading start to finish.

The only absolutely negative note about this book was the unnecessarily crude sexual content.  It demeaned the characters who were partly defined by it, and that's a shame.  I understand it was used to demarcate the emptiness and futile hate or guilt of those characters, but it came off as cheap and crass.  This could have been expressed without the uncouth verbiage.  This story deserved better.

This reader found himself, through much of the book, only liking one character but the good roundup ending caused another to shine even more. Actually, to me, but obviously not to the author, the best and most interesting  character was miserably killed off within the first few pages. So much for me having someone to root for.

Besides the character issues, several times the bunch behaved so unlikely that it damaged the credibility of the book. Of course, you need to suspend belief to read a book like this due to the situation (people back in time 67 mm years) but they need to act like you'd expect a bunch thrown back then to act.

Another thing that I find stupid about this movie is that when Patience is slipping out of the jail cell by going through the bars, one of them moves and it's obvious that it's made out of rubber or plastic.  Like 60% of this movie is CGI but they couldn't take some of their budget and CGI the bar into not moving to make it look realistic?

1003,"I haven't read any of the author's other books so I really didn't know what to expect from this book.  I thought it might be a humorous social satire -- when I told my co-workers the basic story line, they all laughed -- so I decided to take a chance on it. This could have been a scathingly funny book in the hands of a writer who really understands and likes women and can poke fun at our foibles without getting ugly, but this is not that book and apparently not that writer. I just don't find any humor in a man using sex to control and manipulate the female population and the overall feel of the book to me was misogynistic, not humorous.  Reading it made me want to burn it in my driveway to help exorcise it from my mind.

This book has a LOT of sex so don't read it if you aren't comfortable with that.  But all that sex is very unsexy and instead ranged from clinical to gross.  The first three pages of this book were my first clue that this was going to be an unpleasant reading experience.  The main female character is raped in a public courtroom and no one comes to her aid.  The circumstances are explained much later in the book but that passage made me very uncomfortable.

For social satire to be effective, it has to paint an accurate (even if exaggerated) picture of the follies of society it is intending to skewer. The main female character fails in that aspect.  She is supposed to be a young lawyer at a NY firm and the author has her fetching coffee and looking for chairs for a meeting.  Young lawyers do a lot of grunt work but it is all billable legal grunt work. And the notion that nearly all women would buy the Beautiful You products and then abandon their jobs, families and every other aspect of their lives reflect such a poor understanding of what women are like that it makes the book fail for me.

I don't throw around the term misogyny lightly, but this book felt anti-woman from beginning to end.  I really can't recommend that any women read this book.  I suspect that there will be a number of readers who think this book is brilliant and hilarious -- and I suspect that they will be overwhelmingly male.",1,"[-0.5617436528267843, 2.0229646820092615, -1.9385530543642866, -1.0619666577239082, -2.046140047955072]",2.0229646820092615

He can't free himself and the film shows his experiences over 127 hours of agony. It never gets boring, manages to tell a simple but believable story and allows you to empathize with the main character's plight. Camp and comedy are avoided here in favor of an effectively dramatic performance about one man's ordeal. What struck me was how easily anyone can relate to this situation in some way. I'm surprised more people haven't rated and reviewed this little gem. It got 6 Oscar nominations but only managed to break even at the box office.

9528,"And we got another pathetic film about an old couple tried so hard to reignite their romance and salvage their shipwreck marriage, decided to go back to Paris, rent the same room when they had their honeymoon a trillion years ago. But later found out that only loathing, disgust and despise to each other, a deep cynicism remained in their marriage. And in this pathetic and another highly unlikely film, we had an old fart, a walking-dead and walking-stiff American(?), played by the English, Sir Michael Caine, a widower aimlessly and mindlessly lived in Paris, the city of forever romance, just awaiting the Guy in the Black Hole to summon him anytime. Then miracle happened, a miracle that could only happened in a MOVIE; he met a young French woman twice younger his age. Then he suddenly rejuvenated, started to shave his white beard daily, had his fuzzy hairs on an almost baldy head professionally cut, shampooed and hair saloon-ed. Then his son with a broken marriage showed up and messed up the relationship and took over. What a pathetic but also so stupid scenario, I cried out-loud and asked myself: What is the purpose of making this movie? Why suddenly the movie makers became so interested in producing such kind of fantasy to fool we old farts? Then as it seems not enough to quench such last hurrah of romance, yearning to happen by most senior citizens, came the even more stupid and disgusting movie, ""Elsa & Fred (2014)"". Lord of Mercy, when you become such an old fart with all the joints hurt so bad day and night, with blurry eyesight with floaters swimming freely in your eyes, loosing, stinking rotten teeth, bad smell and mysterious odors oozing out of your body, with chronicle constipation, uncontrollable gas rumbling inside that results constant farting, noises whistling in your ears, swollen knuckles, shrunk muscles no matter how you try to exercise, white stubs under your chin...yet you are still craving for young women...and if you still have lot of money, would it be still possible to happen? And that's your shameless secret, your hush-hush wet dreams. Yeah, right, senor. Would you please give it a rest?! Where I put my reading glasses?

Yes, there was a woman commander named Artemesia(though she was not in overall command and is best known for cutting through one of the other Persian ships, sending it to the bottom, as she fled).  And the Persians did burn Athens.  Aside from that, the movie was utter nonsense.
Then again, it is based on the gendre of ""graphic novels"", which are essentially comic books for adults who never learned to read in schools(working too hard on their self-esteem and too little on their studies?).  For this reason, I had low expectations.

3) The tablet will mysterious shut off without any reason. You have to press your left hand point finger so hard and maintain the pressure, otherwise the tablet will not awake from the dead.

9270,"I have tried (and tried) to get the Fulci cult.  I don't.  This man's films are wretched.  They make no sense, they are so ridiculously cheap, the dialogue is horrendous (in both the English dub and the original Italian version), and the acting is atrocious.  However, they are rather nasty in their gore.  You do remember it in all of his films.  Here, it's acid getting poured on someone's face, a man's face being eaten by tarantulas, and the usual zombies getting their brains splattered everywhere.  The ending is a bit surreal (which I usually like endings like that), but I don't know whether it was intentional or just an accident because of lazy, incompetent filmmaking.  I have seen many Fulci films, including House by the Cemetary, Cat in the Brain, New York Ripper, etc..  I saw this one twice.  The first time was with a friend, and she wouldn't shut up during it, commenting on how bad it was.  So I rented it again, and it was as bad as she said it was.  I even watched the original Italian version with English subtitles, and it was still awful.  People swear Fulci's a genius.  You can see his influence on many horror films today, with their emphasis on gore, incoherency, underdeveloped storylines, junk dialogue, and bad acting.  I read that Lucio was originally a comedy director in Italy, and he worked with Toto the Clown, one of the most famous clowns/actors in Italy during his heyday.  Supposedly, those films were really good.  I would like to see them.

7803,"I really stressed over buying this for mostly slicing bread, but I am a bread baker, I teach bread baking, and it was time to get the slicing end of things right! I have tried every bread knife and slicing guide on the market. Most work fine. (The Mercer bread knife on Amazon  is the best.). It wasn't the knives or the guides, it was ME. I couldn't slice evenly no matter what I did. One end thick, the other thin, you know what I'm talking about right?

When this slicer arrived I had 3 loaves waiting. One was a no knead loaf with a very crunchy, crusty exterior, another a very soft Challah egg bread, and the third, ciabatta rolls.  I had to experiment, of course, to get the right thickness for me. I found that the 12 & 1/2  notch area on the dial made  about a 1/2"" slice and was just right.

The loaves were a bit too big for the pronged pusher at first, so I very carefully sliced off the first three pieces before using it to hold the breads in place. Yes, it's much better to follow the rules and cut the loaf in half to use with the pusher, but well, I was anxious to see how it worked. Talk about impressive! The loaves were sliced into PERFECTLY EVEN slices in a matter of seconds!  Yes, SECONDS!  I knew at that moment that I should not have hesitated getting this slicer.

I got over my thinking that I'll only use this for bread, and I  tried a yam that I had on hand. Wow, yam chips in an instant. I raided the vegetable bin and sliced cabbage, a russet potato, and an onion. I was a slicing fool. I wasn't looking forward to the clean up but it turned out to be less of a bother than I thought. The bread crumbs were blown away with my compressed air can, and all I did to clean the blade was unplug the machine and carefully wipe it with a damp sponge.

1302,"I've been a sporadic reader of Gothic romance since my teens (a very, very long time). I favor the ones without paranormal elements and, in that respect, Jennifer St. Giles' Gothics work for me.  In this one, for example, there is just a touch of the paranormal with the heroine and her sister having slight psychic abilities.  Other than that, this is a pretty straightforward Victorian Gothic.

What bothered me about this, as opposed to other St. Giles Gothics I've read, is that I felt it needed better editing to eliminate excess tangential subplots, wordiness, and repetitiveness, and there was a failure to fully realize the mystery plot and its resolution.  There was TMI about unimportant things, such as the h's sisters' strange ""tea"" parties with the H's brother and friends, or the h's preoccupation with restricted personal hygiene (although rather funny at first) when working undercover as a maid, the strange nighttime activities of the H speculated upon ad infinitum, etc. and not enough time spent getting into the mystery.

What's the mystery?  There were two murders, one of a woman some 8 years ago and the recent death of the h's cousin Mary.  Cassie, our h, infiltrates the house where Mary had been governess to a young blind girl, pretending to be a maid.  She spends most of her time making friends with another young maid, yearning for baths and uselessly exploring the house at night. I say ""uselessly"" as far as making any headway into the mystery of Mary's death, but it was very useful for meeting the H, who closets himself away during the day and is up all night making mysterious noises.

Because the book seemed excessively long to me, I tended to skim and read quickly towards the end.  Perhaps because of this I did not find much satisfaction with the ending.  Yes, the romance ended with an HEA but I remained a bit puzzled about the first murder, the one 8 years ago.  Not wishing to go back and read more carefully, I'll just resign myself to not knowing.

This was free.  As such, it's an OK read, but, IMO, not if you have to pay for it.  I doubt I'll read the sequels unless they are offered for free at some point.",1,"[-1.6229531242517554, 1.6540421403072485, -1.589980191701657, -1.0692085964950324, -2.524850222036829]",1.6540421403072485

I'm sure that's due to all the FSOG takeoffs I have read, not sure that's a good thing, it just is.  So when I got into this book I kept waiting, and waiting, and waiting for some to show up.

There were some sex scenes, but I had to laugh because the sex scenes throughout the story ended up being the cliffhangers in and of themselves, a take that you don't read very often.

There some good points but way too many negative points to even think about a three star review at this point. I took my review down to see if they would have this fixed by christmas. Well, that has not happened and the game is still buggy, slow, and has too many problems for it to get anything but one or two stars. Other games have been fixing their mistakes and this one seems like it just cannot get there in time for anything to matter.

This is M's flagship franchise. The reviews all praised it to high heaven despite it being near-broken. That was step one in the problem. No pro reviewer worth their salt ever mentioned how buggy this game was. And you think people are not getting paid to shill on this release? Or in the least they are sent out their own game which they play with fellow reviewers and no one else.... those are the only two options.

Single player still has tons of glitches. Halo 2 is a mess and there was no need to run two engines at once in the game as it isn't even true 1080p ffs. Halo 3 needed a full HD release by itself and instead got some half-assed release that barely looks any different than the 360. There is a huge lack of anisotropic shading to make anything defined in the distance. There are tons of jaggies.

I don't know if they ran a bad batch or if some dogs reacted to an ingredient that was sourced from a different supplier when they made it, but there does not appear to be any difference in the formula from what I can see on the labels of the 38.5 size bage and this newly packaged size of 35 pounds. The ingredients listed are identical, if I was to guess why this new listing for a 35 pound bag and the 38.5 pound  bag being ""out of stock"" now is their way to get away from people reading how this formula made a lot of dogs sick over the past 4-5 months when people read the most recent reviews.

My dogs all ate it up like it was candy, none appeared ill after wards, bowels were a bit softer as I did not transition them, I wanted to see if it made any of them sick. At first I only gave a little, then I gave them a full meal when 8 hours had passed and I saw no negative reactions. Then I gave them it for 2 days and so far all is good.
I think that whatever the problem was they fixed it.  BUT ALWAYS read the most recent reviews on any dog food as so many have been recalled due to  changes in formulas or who supplied the manufacturer with the ingredients..
I do not like the way they went about it, I would rather the mnfr commented and told how they resolved the issue and was above board but regardless it appears that this one is good to go now, All my dogs liked it and its nutritional value is in keeping with the other dog foods that have grain in them, you will pay  a LOT more for the grain free types.",1,"[-0.08644775423707518, 1.617973495016214, -1.7375470299191957, -1.1027251288165139, -1.507985481710941]",1.617973495016214

Each character does a lot of talking.
The characters are young, maybe that is why I couldn't get into it. I mean when hero and heroine kiss, people make gagging noises and tells them to get a room, and that is in the epilogue.
I feel if it had character growth and better writing this could have been a good read, especially with the real life situations it was tackling. It was just poorly written. And not enough.
The details are lacking which ruins the romance.
I didn't like the epilogue, Dean got a home, yet there was no happy ever after. It was more happy for now, or just settling every one of the situations into the epilogue.

Unlikeable and not very well thought out characters.  I could not imagine a scenario where I would not spend at least part of my Christmas with my husband and daughter (if I had a daughter).  Yes, it was a big break to be asked to write some sample screenplays for a possible TV series, but Georgie could have taken her laptop and written anywhere and conferred with her writing partner by phone and email.

Watching men brutalize each other for hour upon hour seems an implausible way to pass the time. I watched the 1st season and learned nothing from it other than that those in prison, or who make films about prison, enjoy romanticizing life behind bars when it is simply a bunch of damned savages behind bars. None of the characters seem to have any motivation or any goals in mind other than to commit mayhem. The fact that the protagonist in the first episode winds up being half beaten to death and then having lighter fluid set aflame on him while recuperating is about as dramatic as watching grass grow. Mindless useless violence. I threw the discs in the garbage. To make matters worse these episodes have an aged quality about them, as if the episodes were shot forty years ago.

The writing is wonderful, with lots of hidden meanings (and some not so hidden:  H/h's names are Adam and Eve...)  and symbolism and extremely smart dialogue.  In fact, I can always count on this author to provide amusing and witty conversations and there are great ones in this book.  The story has a nice pace and leads up to a slow boil of passion and tension.  So well done!!
A believable tale of love and passion between the courtesan and the vicar was going to be hard to pull off and it was well done all the way until the denouement.  Sadly, that was just too over-the-top, required too much suspension of disbelief and almost ruined the book for me.  That is why I only gave this book 4 stars and, in fact, this was more of a 3.5 stars.  Also, I am not sure what happened to the editing but this book needs to be re-edited and corrected!  There were way too many typos and grammatical erros (lots of wrong pronouns, for example.)  Very strange and not characteristic of this author at all.  Finally, another problem was the change in the heroine's name:  I just told myself if was the author vascillating between the heroine's  aristocratic monikers but it was very distracting.  In fact, the first time Eve, ""Lady Wareham"" was suddenly ""Lady Balmain"" I groaned, assuming poor editing.  There is probably an explanation but it took me out of the book each time it changed.  Not good.

7634,"My wife and I got a breadmaker for Christmas and were very excited to get some bread mixes to try out.  I'm a health nut, and this seemed like the healthiest mix I could find.  So, just pour in the wet ingredients, then the dry, then hit the ""whole wheat"" setting on the breadmaker (1.5 pound loaf), and 3:45 later, fresh whole wheat bread!

I use this bread every day for my sandwiches. Just slice some in the morning (I store it in a large Ziploc bag), and several hours later I'm eating a super fresh sandwich. Even though the bread is a ""honey wheat"", I taste no honey in it, and it's definitely NOT sweet. This is a good thing, as I wouldn't want sweet bread to use for sandwiches.

The bread keeps very well in a ziploc bag for roughly 10 days. It may not rise as much as some other wheat breads you buy in the store, but it's still adequate for sandwiches and very tasty. I tried the whole grain white bread, and it rose twice as high as the wheat, making it impossible for me to fit into a bag!

The only complaint I've had is the way Amazon has played with the price. When I got it the loaves cost roughly one dollar, and now they're close to three dollars. So if you get lucky, it can be very economical to use this instead of buying commercial, processed bread. But if the price stays where it's at, it makes it much more challenging to decide which way you want to go, unfortunately.",1,"[0.2930937845588131, 1.504405484085019, -1.9541024204782689, -1.0645283916519401, -1.748684541175991]",1.504405484085019

7793,"I have had this mattress for months now, and it is still like the first day I bought it.

I have always bought `traditional' mattresses. My last one was a Sealy Posturpedic and was not even 3 years old!  It sagged so badly on one side. It also made a lot of noise when I turned at night. It literally was giving me a complex. I am not a big person and do not weigh much so when your bed is making noise when you turn, you tend to think maybe your bed is trying to tell you something. In my case it was telling me what junk it was.

When this mattress came it was compressed and left at my front door. It was hard to carry it in by myself. I had a friend come over, who handles packages at UPS, open it for me and we both moved it into my bedroom. I have a platform bed but to be safe, I bought some additional wood (smooth) at Lowe's hardware so it was more than level. The mattress has a cover on it and has a grip feeling on the underside so it stays in place. I am sensitive to smell and did not notice a smell on the bed. I let it air out all afternoon and evening, and was able to sleep on it that same night.

I will say it is very firm. It is not too firm for me though. I have a waterproof mattress pad on top of it, a pillow top one, and a heated mattress pad. I was scared I could not use the heated mattress pad but have not had any issues with it. I keep it on top on the other pads.

I can not think of any complaints with this mattress. I was concerned about the edges. Someone wrote that they went down if you sat on the edge. I will say that is not true. Mine holds up very well, if not better than a traditional mattress.

I wanted to wait a few months before posting my review to see if the mattress changed shape or form but it has not. I love crawling into bed. I will mention I have arthritis in my knees, hips, and hands. I also had/have back issues due to a difficult pregnancy. I could not walk for months. However, with physical therapy and sleeping in this bed, I do not wake up with any pain at all. It hugs my pain at night.

I highly recommend this mattress and for the price you can't go wrong.",1,"[1.192598471225595, 1.4969108238754556, -2.310950244589046, -1.1089082471045366, -0.922988463894271]",1.4969108238754556

I'm not sure where to begin...I both love and despise this novel. This book is not a quick or easy read, but it definitely is thought-provoking. I normally do not even attempt books with bored housewives as the main character because, well, the stories are usually dull. This one breaks that mold. Although there are moments where I want to scream at this MC, her internal thoughts are so real and philosophical, that I wanted to know what happened next, but also how she would respond. The setting also plays a major role in the story. The characters are authentic, the story is desperate and gritty, and the writing is engaging and intelligent.

It is exactly what it says it is, a story of a girl who sexually services the members of a motorcycle club, and she makes no apologies for doing so. I liked both her, her story, and all of the characters in her life.

I can't understand someone reading the descriptive blurb of this and then get upset when it contains somewhat explicit sexual scenes and vulgar language. Exactly what were you expecting when you read the words Motorcycle Club, flowers, candy and poetry? Enough of my little rant now on that!

Going back to the book review here, like I said, I found it a very enjoyable read.

4050,"When I read the blurb for this story, I thought it would be right up my alley. I love dark stories and captivity themes are among my favorites. So, the story of a girl kidnapped and forced into sexual slavery sounded like a guaranteed dark success.

Unfortunately, this book fell flat for me. The characters seemed completely disconnected from the events taking place in the story. When they did have any type of reaction to the events transpire get, it was disproportionate and, at times, inappropriate for the situation.

For example, there is one scene where the heroine, ""Silver"", has supposedly just been brutally gang-raped and instead of the expected emotional turmoil and distress, she is savoring chocolate cake. Seriously? That scene was paired with the anecdotal comment that ""chocolate fixes everything"". Well, thanks for that pearl of wisdom, but I'm pretty certain that chocolate does not fix everything!

The detachment between the main characters emotions and the events taking place in the story made the entire story unbelievable. It just didn't ring true. Sometimes the emotions seemed rushed, or force-fed to the reader. Other times, the characters seemed to lack any of the expected, appropriate emotions for the given situation.

There were also a fair amount of grammatical mistakes in this book. If there hadn't been other issues with the execution of the plot, I could have overlooked this. However, as it is, the grammatical errors just proved to add more irritation.

Overall, I give this story 2 1/2 stars. The premise was promising, but the execution was lacking. The story was not as dark as I'd expected, with only a few ""darkish"" scenes. The characters were not compelling and failed to sell the story. Instead, the story comes across as unbelievable, and at times laughable.",1,"[-1.1850782304263072, 1.4819552781285035, -1.9446041508170882, -1.0670432978642663, -1.5889722613974693]",1.4819552781285035
218,"If you're an Elizabeth Boyle fan but feel that she is perhaps a tad too historically accurate in her characters' behavior and speech and that her plots and characters are not silly, superficial and one-dimensional enough, then this Lynsay Sands book is the one for you.  I'm pretty sure Sands wasn't even intending for this HR to have any ""historical"" in it, but why then bother to throw words like ""aye"", ""'tis"" and ""'twas"" into the dialogue as if attempting some kind of period speech?  Just leaving it all modern would have worked better for me.

The plot is a farce and I'm sure it was meant to be so, but somehow instead of finding it LOL funny, I just found it to be silly.  It also is full of more holes than Swiss cheese and is so simplistic that if it weren't for the several hot sex scenes, I would have thought it was a book intended for 15-year-old girls.

The characters are appealing in a one-dimensional, cartoonish way, but I like a little more depth in character and plot.  The three sisters in the book (1800s England is the setting, I believe) are named Chrissy, Suzette and Lisa.  'Nuff said.  So avoid this book if, like me, you prefer HR authors such as Madeline Hunter, Judith James, Joanna Bourne, Carla Kelly, Julia Ross, the old Mary Jo Putney (pre-Lost Lords), etc.  On the other hand, if you like cute HRs, this is a cute one.

3139,"Time marches on and another Pendergast novel hits the streets.  Unfortunately this one appears to primarily recycle characters that occasionally disappear and randomly reappear at convenient times.  Constance Greene is elevated to a main character, Proctor is fleshed out significantly, and even the busy-body Mrs. Trask has some meat added to her bones.  Howard Longstreet is introduced as an FBI investigator along with a backstory that ties in with that of our intrepid Special Agent.  And we are introduced to a female villain whose heart and mind reminds us of the dearly departed Diogenes.  But Aloysius, the slender white specter in the black suit, finds himself fully occupied elsewhere, joining the fray mid-point in the story.

There is no reason for me to tell you the story that other reviewers have already alluded to, especially since many of them have included spoilers that can ruin your hunches of where the action will lead.  But for some reason the story itself and its presentation seemed 'tired' to me, almost like the  authors had to really be creative and tried to wring out everything they could involving the characters and their interactions with each other.  Could it be that they simply 'tried too hard'?  Or, perish the  thought, has the Pendergast series finally worn itself out?

I have spent many (MANY) hours reading the works of these two authors, hours full of mystery, intrigue, unorthodox and imaginative crime solving, and the development of unique and complicated characters who have piqued my interest and entertained me time and time again.  The authors' writing remains the same, clear and concise, eloquent without being flowery, replete with subtle (and sarcastic) humor, taking the reader on a trip full of twists and turns that eventually arrives at a complicated ending -- usually one leaving the reader twisting in the wind until the next novel picks up the frayed ends. However that may also be indicative that the authors are reaching the end of their rope.

But even if it is more accurate than I think, it's still a bad book.  The characters and plot (such as it is) are trite and predictable, the dialogue likewise.  It's like ""Scrubs"" without the comedy (which was pretty good).

I have always liked and actually respected Sanjay Gupta, but he doesn't do himself any credit with this novelized version of ""General Hospital.""  I can only surmise that CNN and his other gigs aren't paying him well enough, or at least not as much as he thinks he deserves.

However, besides all that - and an unforgivable sin in my book - the book is sloppily put together, and the editor needs to have an eye (or brain) exam (presumably Dr. Ty Wilson could do the latter).  It is replete with typos, beginning in the early pages (the word ""sections"" appears where the context makes it clear that it should be ""seconds"") and continuing throughout.

7477,"Once upon a time, an SLR came with a 50(ish) mm ""standard"" lens with a maximum aperture of somewhere in the f 1.4-2.0 range. Today a 28-70mm (or digital equivalent) zoom is usually kitted with an SLR. This has a maximum aperture generally in the f 4.0-5.6 range. That's something like 1/2 to 1/4 the light gathering ability, and often considerable optical quality, given away in exchange for cheap zooms.

If you're looking at this, then you've probably decided on a 50mm or so prime lens, likely because the kit zoom lens is both slow and not very good quality. Here are the options for Canon:

Canon 50mm f/1.8 (version 2): It's inexpensive, very fast compared to any cheap zoom and exceptionally good for the price. On the down side, it's cheap feeling, noisy in focusing, and difficult to focus manually. You should buy at least this.

Canon 50mm f/1.4: A little bit faster, but that's a less important trait these days with good digital high effective ISOs. More importantly, it's robust, easy to use, with full-time manual focusing (you can just grab the ring even when it's autofocusing), and good image quality

Sigma 50mm f/1.4: More expensive than the Canon lens, but slightly better image quality wide open. It's a tough sell since the quality change isn't huge. But if the extra money and Sigma logo don't bother you, then go for it.

Canon 50mm f/1.2: Big money for that extra light-gathering ability. If you need this for photographing in a club, then you'll buy it. If you don't need it, it's too expensive and heavy to compete with the lenses above.

Another, used, option, the original Canon 50mm f/1.8 EF lens was sturdier and better built, but they're only available used and possibly abused. I own one and am happy with it. I have shot with the Canon f/1.4 as well and that's the lens that I'd buy today.",1,"[-1.6709006988694879, 1.3999551251774305, -1.618650338016392, -1.0654808887773326, -1.5750363994622438]",1.3999551251774305

For me the writing was extremly flat. Perhaps my receiver is jammed but I just couldn't feel any of those sentiments other reviewers could. The words, sentences were there but they didn't convey any emotions for me. I didn't feel the love between the characters, I was only told they loved each other but was unable to feel it. The story itself wasn't bad but the execution failed.
The writing felt as passionate as a handshake with a stranger in the office or a news report about economic trends in my daily newspaper.
On the other hand I understand not every writing style is for everyone. So despite not feeling the romance with my 3 stars I appreciated the work of the author. The characters, their backgrounds and the storyline were thought-out, technically speaking the writing was good (in terms of grammar and editing).

Advertisers have known all along that economic decisions are often heavily based on social, cognitive and emotional factors.  We can know too.  Author Dan Ariely gave incredible insights into ways that people commonly make irrational decisions.  Sure they were based on college experiments, but we learn a lot about ourselves from the results and Ariely's interpretations.

From knowledge gained studying irrational decision-making, I wonder to what extent we can rationalize behavior.  It seems the complexity of decision-making might be increasing, and the irrational biases are apparently hardwired.  For example, even though we know based on Ariely's research that we put energy into being penny wise and pound foolish regarding certain purchases, it seems likely that smart people will continue to do so.

The solutions posed in the book are really separate from the value of the knowledge gained.  Obviously, government has a legitimate role in consumer protection.  Consumers, working constantly and with no time to research the fine print of every type of deal, should be protected to some extent.  Even so, there is no way government can protect citizens from every pitfall.  It makes me wonder if a type of training could be devised to help me, and all of us, override most irrational impacts on decision-making.",0,"[1.3706011891229586, 0.39612902100727754, -2.2953813497967053, -1.0493411936007546, -1.3172689161413147]",1.3706011891229586

This story was an emotional rollercoaster ride. There was dangerous situations, sacrifices, anger, angst, commitment, loyalty, happiness and love.
The love two people can share only in a great romance book is here. Sacrifices and putting your partner ahead of your own desires. The agony of despair when all is felt lost. The gathering of family and friends uniting to bring happiness no matter what. And the partner who is never willing to give up the one thing they so desired from the other - Love.
This book had me from Chapter one and I could not put it down. Anna knows how to capture one's attention. The characters are so well written and the interaction between the two is hot! Oh, there is lots of sex too. I highly recommend this book to my friends and family. Congratulations, Anna! I am so excited that I had the opportunity to read this amazingly well-written story.

It has a refreshing minty taste with an odd lingering aftertaste.  This might be thanks to the stevia.  My dilemma is if this is worth the price.  The first ingredient is water.  On the nutrition panel none of the amino acids, vitamins, antioxidants, enzymes & minerals the bottle says aloe vera contains are listed.  Just sodium & sugar.  The lack of any nutrients on the nutrition facts makes me wonder if there is anything what so ever nutritional about Aloe Gloe.

My normal choice for aloe is by the brand Lily Of The Desert.  Their aloe juice is certified organic containing only 3 ingredients:  organic inner aloe leaf, citric acid & potassium sorbate.  On the nutrition facts it says it contains 25mg calcium, 4mg magnesium, 58ml aloe filet (aloe gloe on the other hand does not even say how much aloe is actually in the water!)

2742,"Too Bad To Die is described as a WWII thriller in which British Naval Intelligence officer Ian Fleming races to foil a Nazi plot to assassinate Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin at the Tehran Conference. Since I am a big fan of historical thrillers and especially those set during WWII, I was certain Too Bad To Die was going to be a big hit with me.

To its credit, I enjoyed the rich historical detail Francine Mathews packs into her latest book, and I learned a lot about many of those people who were world leaders and influencers of those leaders during WWII.

Unfortunately, however, I felt that Mathews spent so much of her book packing historical details into it that they overshadowed her ability to tell a tense and enthralling thriller. For me, Too Bad To Die moved at such a slow pace that by the time any real thrills and actions occurred they were too little, too late. Further, while the tidbits about many of the 'real people' characters were interesting and, at times, juicy, Mathews' ability to present richly developed characters -- including her main character, Ian Fleming -- was just mediocre. As a result of these flaws, on several occasions I came very close to giving up on this book.

And then there are those books that scream at you and each word tumbles into your soul and fills you up and has you turned inside out and outside in and whispers to your heart and thats when a book turns into something much more than just a book... Kennedy Ryan is a mastermind when it comes to joining words together to make a story ( that is so much more than just a story its a journey). She takes your heart with her hands and pumps her words through you and breaks your heart because the words the words are so much more they are jagged pieces that cut they are real and their edges will cut.. and then she takes that same heart she just shredded and puts it back together. I have fallen in love over and over with so many books a true reader doesnt have just one favorite book but sometimes we find one that attaches itself to you and breathes its words into your soul and those are the gems that we seek and this book is it..

643,"I can't say exactly what drew me to this book in the first place. It's not my typical read, but the title sucked me in with promises of Houdini facing off with the great medium of his time.

I wasn't disappointed.

The writing flowed well and kept me captivated. The story is wildly interesting. I had no idea that spiritism was such a big thing in America and that such prominent names were involved with it.

More than once, I got a bit freaked out after finishing a chapter. The seances could be quite spooky to read about and I can only imagine how much spookier they were for the people experiencing them. Even though mediums were routinely exposed as false and their tricks discovered, that didn't diminish the eerie feeling that permeated throughout the book.

When it comes to complaints about the book, I have only one. It was too long.

The historical account was enough to raise the hair on the back of my neck and make my arms break out in goosebumps. But it took so long to get anywhere with the story that I got frustrated. There are a lot of in-depth backstory about people that don't have much, if any, relevance to the story.

Length aside, The Witch of Lime Street is fabulous. It's a well-researched and fascinating account of a time in our history when science and spiritism nearly joined hands.

As far as the book now, it started like wildfire--like the gun shot off and the horses started running. Had me hooked right from the beginning.

But I wanted to see who Petra ended up with so I kept reading (not knowing it continues in another book). There were some lol moments for me with some of the things she said but other than that, it couldn't make up for the overabundance of sex. It just didn't seem believable to me and they never gave you HIS p.o.v. So I don't know if he was real or just acting.

There's a touch of suspense in the mix with this one and a touch of gritty reality that has been flowing through this whole series!  This story is about change, hope, family, and love!  What a year these siblings have been through!!!!  Completing the four siblings tales, Levi picks up the plot and finds what his siblings have already found!  Continuing also with Tess I really LOVED her stories continuation!  There's a scene where she and another character are so open and honest about what they are feeling!  I LOVED it!  It is so refreshing among the suspense and turmoil of hidden secrets and feelings from other characters!  With the characters coming together in REALLY GREAT scenes and their pasts colliding with their present, this is a highly entertaining read and became one of my favorites of the series!

This flick is such a shamblesome, interminable, wanky waste of time and talent... Whoever ordained director Wes Anderson as an auteur probably regrets it now: the most remarkable thing about him is his immense hubris in baldly recycling all the strained humor of the ""wacky"" counterculture comedies of the last four decades, and condensing it into one, horribly dull, overlong film. I mean, look, I really do ""get"" that the whole point of this style of humor lies in its excessiveness; but that doesn't mean that everything the director does is instantly going to be ""good""... and this trainwreck of a film is definitely NOT GOOD. Anderson's directorial philosophy seems to be make it funny -- no, wait: even funnier -- by constantly upping the ante... Every single detail of the film has to be odd, quirky, off-center, out there and bizarre. The technique is so mannered and predictable that it's incredibly boring. Couldn't he have worked on the plot, or the premise, or the acting, instead of his own insatiable uber-cleverness? Besides, wasn't this film a disaster before, when they made it as ""Hotel New Hampshire?"" Perhaps I wouldn't have been so turned off had it not been for all the...packaging on the DVD copy I rented -- I mean, really... a 2-CD set deluxe set complete with an entire extra disc of ""bonus"" material?

Excellent story and writing. Great build and pace with really nice details. Loved the changing POV's, both Will and Hanna each have a great voice. Loved the laugh-out-loud funny moments and there was a nice amount of sexy times too. Will and Hanna are always so playful and I love getting to see that side of them in full force. There was also a nice bit of angst, drama, and emotion happening and I loved how it was a touch more serious and seeing how they handled it. There were major changes happening and I had this ""awww, they're all grown up"" feeling happening. It was awesome! This was a really well rounded, fun story to read and it just made my heart happy.

Love when all the couples get together. They've forms such great friendships and they're own little family and I enjoy all their interactions and personalities. It was all so entertaining. It was fun seeing George again too... he was in one of my favorite scenes! Seriously hysterical!

This was just an awesome read. Totally entertaining and sexy! A definite five star read for me and an excellent addition to the Beautiful Bastard series. I so love Bennett, Chloe, Max, Sara, Will and Hanna so much! Player Will be in my heart forever!

Even his comics that I have read have fallen short of standards I have set based on other writers. Having said that, I was not expecting much out of this movie at all, but being a comic book fan I rented it. With low expectations I actually like it, and after I watched it I found myself thinking about the movie more and more so I watched it again before I returned it. Well I liked the cheesy dialog and the over the top acting so I bought it to add to my collection. Reading other reviews I totally understand why so many didn't like it. They all seemed to have high expectations for it and were disappointed. Since I was expecting it to be bad it actually turned out to be enjoyable.

9380,"the young actress is one of the most talented young actors and a good news to the movie viewers. she's a very enjoyable image. but there are lot of big holes and bad leaks in this not-bad movie:

1)the scene she carelessly watched directly at the camera didn't delete.

2)there is no immediate response when the young girl reported to the stewardess that a man got into the restroom where a woman was already inside. what kind of training that stewardess really got?

3)the 911 operator and police responding times were both ridiculously long

4)so after the rocket blast, no one questioned her and just took for granted? nobody questioned her why she changed the room? and the victim just came up to her and said 'thanks'?

5)yeah, in order to make the young psycho looked bad, you just casted a young man who looked so obviously like psycho and still made the heroine like to talk to him in the airport? that guy's goofy and spooky face would turn every normal woman right away from him, albeit talking to him, having a drink with him, and didn't try to change seat right away. a terrible casting mistake.

6)did you ever open yourself up and confess so much of your personal life to a stranger, a fellow traveler, just because he coincidentally seated next to you?

there were so many loose ends that just didn't sell, yet the director and the editor simply did nothing and let them go.

I was more involved in this book reality show that I am involved in most TV reality shows. It was highly addicting.

At least the ending to this film make sense.  The acting here is decent, for a 70's film, and Hackman (who is always top notch) and Winters both did wonderfully.  The action and adventure is this film is high intensity, and while the remake did copy a few of this films best scene's the brilliance was lost in the translation.  Point being that the original, in this instance, is much better than the remake and should be enjoyed by all who haven't had the opportunity to see it yet.  The story is similar in both, both involving a cruise liner flipping over due to a rogue wave, each set in their own time periods, but what makes the films differ is the people aboard.  In this film you have a priest (Hackman) struggling to make his way right with god, and he is the one who ushers everyone to safety.  He wants to help everyone.  In the remake you have a professional gambler only concerned with his own safety.  Not that that is the main reason this film is better, for this film also gets you involved with the cast of characters, understanding all of them, knowing all of them and so you thus can be concerned about all of them.  I guess all that really needs to be said is that if you're like me and you've only seen the remake, please rent this movie and see the masterpiece that inspired the flop.",1,"[-3.0008023844206635, 1.2595576583960568, -1.6484998688681274, -1.0837284816339752, -1.7102755629385809]",1.2595576583960568

The writers attempt to reveal the mistreatment of Muslim women in particular is noble.  Her life story is one of many emotions, trials and tribulations and the efforts on her part to seek equality on behalf of others reveals a great mind in a great person.  It should be fair to say there are many more like her stymied by their religion and background and yet of equal mind if not courage.  I say this because no single ethnic group or religious sect has a monopoly on brains regardless of gender.  Many people are simply what they are taught to be.  To avoid offending anyone I seldom discuss or give thoughts on religion.  I am not knowledgeable enough to discuss the various aspects of the various religions but like many (I suspect) I entertain my own thoughts and opinions.  While this book taught me some about the particular religion involved it made light of the brutality of life for women living under the justification by that particular religion.  I despise anyone involved in the mistreatment of women.  Certainly in my life I have known bar flies who maybe rated a dope slap but the constant abuse and mistreatment of any woman rates as a punishable sin.  I cannot always say they are the fairer sex unless by fairness one means their attitude and treatment of others, male or female.

I found the last  third of the film to be over-the-top in a way the film avoids for its first  half, which is unfortunate.  There is obvious skill, care and attention to  detail in virtually every frame of this movie, and it is difficult not to  appreciate.  Too, it engenders a deep sadness, even while you might want to  throw up.",1,"[-1.3173131212649283, 1.2449158222899728, -2.264606193975523, -1.0706443583227003, -1.3030323172094038]",1.2449158222899728

9297,"I saw this film last night and what had kept me away from this movie is the same thing that made me watch it. That thing is the negative reviews from friends,internet,media as such. Alright, so it isn't a film for everyone. I don't expect fourteen year olds to like it.

Where this film truly owns is the story line and the execution. I wouldnt think Tom would do a film like this. I was shocked to read towards the end that he was one of the producers. The director leaves absolutely nothing to predictability. There is a lot of suspense and confusion in the plot. I gotta feel it for the disfigured Tom Cruise. He's one fine actor and it's sadly plus interestingly real to know what a life it can be for someone who's had his face disfigured.

The film has many such dialogues and scenes that leave you smiling. The way Cruz jumps after her first liplocking session with TC,the Martini comment on Diaz,the bartender's ""B***h"",the bob dylan angle,the car crash,the best friend love triangle,the sex,the comment on a new birth as cats....

Alright. I won't go into any more details because that is not the purpose of my review. The purpose of my review is to tell you that any and most movie lovers would actually dig this. No , this isn't a romantic comedy. It's not a thriller. It's Vanilla Sky.

Who is this movie for?

This movie is for people who don't dismiss movies on the basis of conclusions but actually like the interesting things about the movie. Please note,anyone who liked the Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind , will like like this movie. I didn't like the movie as much I liked Vanilla Sky. It's done with a more ""we want your money,watcher"" theme.

Anyhow,WATCH THIS MOVIE for the love of originality.

Also,it has the best soundtrack any movie can have.

With much muted respect for originality,

1920,"While browsing in my bookstore, I came up with this book in my hands. In the back cover, the text was the same as one of the editorial reviews stated in this page, the one that ends with: ""... and his name is Jesus Christ"".
So I thought: relics theft, worldwide plague, human cloning, and Jesus Christ all in the same story. These are elements that could make a book great. I Bought it.
After reaching the end of the book, I was very disappointed. The back cover text is not true at all. ""Year zero"" is not an adventure nor a thriller, but more like a philosophical text about a world that was devastated by an ancient plague and the effort by those who were spared to quickly find a cure. Although Long's writing style is not bad, his plot and his characters are dull and boring. After the first 100 pages, which are indeed very interesting and set a premise that could be much more well developed, it's all downhill.
There are many books dealing on apocalypse-like and dead-end-for-humanity situations and many of them are better than ""Year zero"": ""The stand"", ""On the beach"" are just two of them.
If the editors had not wanted to create an adventure-like atmosphere to this book, maybe I would have set my mind on a different frame-reading, and then I could have enjoyed it much more. As it is, I didn't.

Why they can't just make humidifiers that do what they say they will is beyond me.  I am recovering from the Honeywell HWM-331 which I purchased last year.  I cleaned it regularly and was so pleased.  It was my first warm mist model after always having cool mist.  It was wonderful till it broke .  In a matter of 5 days this season everything that could go wrong with it did.  So back I was to investigating for a new one.

I live in a studio apartment and have a strong tendency to sinus infections/asthma.  I chose this model for many reasons and am so pleased with it.  The Honeywell I had had a 2 1/2 gallon tank and it needed to be changed daily.  This model has a 1 gallon tank, covers the same square footage as the other and runs longer on that 1 gallon.  On low it runs for 24 hours and on high it runs for 12.  I run it all the time and have a humidity reader.  I am always within the comfort zone.  Only when it gets very cold out and very dry do I put it on high.  Otherwise it stays on low.  Yes, it does make a low, slight noise as it works but it is so minimal.  Also, it doesn't make my apartment as warm as the other did.

Bottom line, no static, my allergies are great and the machine takes up little space as it works over my whole apartment.  The nightlight is also appreciated for I always know it is working.  There is no perfect model out there and no humidifier, no matter how good the quality, will keep all from getting sick, etc.  And all warm mist models will get calcium buildup on the walls when used frequently.  It goes with the territory.  People are complaining about it with this model and I had the same problem with my previous Honeywell.

I was really disappointed.  I found both Sed and Jessica incoherent,  badly written characters who were impulsive and fundamentally uninteresting.  Anyone who likes to have sex with famous people in public,  can't be devastated if it's caught on video.  Jessica seemed to have no ability to project into the future.  It would absolutely harm her future in corporate america if she worked as a stripper,  but still,  she did it. It would absolutely make a difference to her law school if a sex tape came out,  but still she kept putting herself in situations where it was almost inevitable.  Sed and Jess loved having sex with each other but didn't understand each other at all,  and by the end I was happy to leave them

""Scream"" jump started the horror movie genre in the 1990's. Without ""Scream"" we woudn't have flicks like ""I Know Whay You Did Last Summer"" or ""Urban Legend"". Without ""Scream"" we might not have ""Inside"" or ""Martyrs"". Sure ""Scream"" ushered in the 90's version of slasher flickes, but it also ushered in an era of self referential horror films. Wes Craven was able to poke fun of the genre he helped create....and the ""Scream"" audience was in on the joke.

So many horror films since ""Scream"" have come to rely on the horror converntions set forth in ""Scream"" that it actually feels original.

""Scream"" is meant to be fun, the cast, and the soundtrack both indicate that this is a fun film, not to be taken too seriously. If you've seen ""Terror Train"" or ""Prom Night"" or ""Hell Night"" than you are the target audience for ""Scream"", as an homage to 80's horror, you won't find a better film.

4376,"I didn't get along with the oddly constructed book. I say oddly constructed because it starts with an apparent execution but the next chapter the apparent victim carries on as if nothing happened. The key is that the chapters aren't time sequenced so the second chapter takes place before the first but no indication of that exists in the text. Instead one must reason it out. The execution scene picks up again at about the 80% point which does resolve several threads left loose from the get go.

Thats not the only disconnect I had here. There were many references and simple word usages which baffled me. Likely a good deal of my being lost was due to the book being placed in the context and word usage of the UK, however the references to the music and other pop culture figures which likely add dimension to this book for some, left me utterly at sea. Id say I didn't get a single music reference in the first part of the book. The second part improved my score to maybe 50% but I still was made to feel like an ignoramus by the author.

The book takes place in Ulster, Ireland where nobody exists without being labeled by his or her religion and judged by same. So everybodys a Prod or Finian and either hated or accepted based in the observers hatred or love for one superstition or the other. This is a perfect example of people killing each other over who has the better imaginary friend.

I grew so tired of the religious hatred, constant labeling of everybody based on their religion that the book became a weary slog for me. I didn't care for any of the characters finding the good or bad guys good or bad factions depended on the particular power balance at any given time. The IRA does disgusting acts as do the Loyalists if they get a chance.

The bad guy becomes obvious at about the 50% mark but by that time in the book, the persistent hatreds and annoying references to obscure figures of pop culture had worn me down to the point where I didn't care. The final act does contain a good deal of action unlike the balance of the book but that, while well done, couldn't save it for me. My wife wishes to tour Ireland. If we do go, Ill for sure to avoid Ulster. I owe the book that much.",1,"[0.5663994349812336, 1.2141701095872937, -1.7488417561586975, -1.1092112564475205, -1.792128948672898]",1.2141701095872937

I like a little erotica with my romance bordering on soft porn.  But this was straight out hardcore porn.  Same sex play, sharing and menage, as well as dual couple participation disguised as instruction or teaching lessons.

Instead, it's about her finding passion and learning to trust while overcoming her fear of relationships.  It could've been a good story if it hadn't been overpowered with contrived reasoning to insert hardcore sex.  It became boring and tedious with one sex scene after another.  On top of all this, there's no reiteration through the story of what these two characters looked like other than Dom having aqua blue eyes.  Ms. Sloane...keep them alive in our minds!  Refresh. Reiterate. Repeat the characters details. Subtle reminders go a long way in forming a solid connection.  I never had any idea what Payton looked like other than her killer body.  No visual, no connection.  Anyway, all told from Payton's POV.  It would've been nice to hear from Dominics voice.  The controversy is forced, contrived, and ridiculous.  No turmoil.  No drama.

However, when Amazon, during its price war with Walmart, was selling Under The Dome for just $9.00, I decided to give King another try. For about the first 200 pages I was sure that Under The Dome was a book that was going to make me a born-again King-ite, as he introduced an intriguing plot and several interesting characters that were reminiscent of the ""old days."" This faith was short-lived as too large a portion of the remaining almost 900 pages made for tedious and sometimes boring reading. King filled these passages with excessive, disjointed details and dialogue, characters that were not very well-developed and often seemed cartoon-like, too many plot contrivances that became confusing and annoying rather than stimulating, and an abundance of espousing on his political and religious viewpoints. Despite these serious flaws, I did not think Under The Dome was a bad book. When King was ""on his game"" Under The Dome was exciting, suspenseful and a page-turner. The problem for me, however, was that these exciting times were too few to sustain my interest in a book of 1,072 pages; and, thus, makes it a book that I would not highly recommend.",1,"[-0.1339178024707257, 1.1986814137835635, -1.419892530194922, -1.0757308218691926, -2.1029121494861016]",1.1986814137835635

There was no way any sequel was ever going to live up to the first movie, and that was made apparent when the best they could do for the second movie was to just copy the first one, just swapping out some of the jokes.

This, honestly would have been a far better follow up to the first movie. It expands on what happened in the first movie, even bringing back some of the same characters (even the baby as a 4yr old kid). The best thing about it, is that while it does refer back to the other movies, it was not a carbon copy of them. There is still a lot of crude humor and over the top situations in this one, so if you do not like that kind of stuff in a movie, or did not like the others then you will not like this. I think if you really liked the first movie, you can enjoy this one (even if you did not like the second one) if you are willing to accept the fact that it is not as good as the original.

I really don't know why they decided to use hand puppets for the characters.  Their faces are expressionless for the most part, and it gives off a really creepy vibe, which I don't think was the intention.  The film is a bit dated already, as many targets of its satire are not newsmakers anymore.  Many in the future will watch this film in utter bewilderment, as they will not have the context to understand it, because all of its satire is topical.  Of course, there are gross out jokes (it wouldn't be a Trey and Matt if there wasn't).  I did like some of the satire.  There's a very funny moment at a meeting of ""FAG"" (really childish name) where the Janeane Garofalo hand puppet says ""we should be allowed to read news headlines and pretend they're our own words"".  Janeane recently appeared on Bill Maher's show, and she said ""Bush is the new Saddam"".  This was an actual headline from a Canadian newspaper recently, so I thought the sequence was rather amusing.  In fairness to Janeane, she doesn't do this all the time, but it's still worth noting.  But too often these incisive satiric moments like that are few and far between, and the film relies on gross out humour, bad jokes, monotonic dialogue, and just lazy writing.

Like some other reviewers I also was frustrated by the fact that the hero was passive and didn't fight for the heroine and that she had to make all the running for the ""HEA"" -- which made that HEA unconvincing.

Old maids sit about pinching pennies (or farthings) poke their heads outdoors to frown on their neighbors and head back inside to grouse.  A reader of this review commented that some of the details (I considered them banalities) do indeed constitute spoilers and therefore I have deleted them from this edited version (12/5/11).

That same reader was kind enough to point out the history of the novel which explains its disjointed narrative and lack of cohesion.  Whille I understand better why it is such a tedious stinker, I am no more inclined to improve my opinion.  The book is nothing more than a multitude of the mundane strung together as plot.  Our narrator pops in and out of town on visits recording these banalities to what end?  A few instances made me smile, a skirmish between fans of Dr. Johnson and Dickens had some charm but for the most part the characters and their lives left me bored.

You, as the reader, will also find your normal life put on hold, as you won't be able to put this book down. With Velocity, Koontz returns to the top echelon of thriller writers. Velocity provides not only a fast-paced, nail-biting, suspenseful storyline, it contains characters that are very well-developed and multi-dimensional. The main character, Billy Wiles, who on the surface seems like an ordinary, hardworking guy, is one that you'll remember for a long time. I've enjoyed many of Koontz's books over the years and Velocity ranks very near the top -- second only to Watchers, Intensity and Dark Rivers Of The Heart. Velocity is definitely worth reading but --beacause of its slightly disappointing ending -- is not worthy of a 5-star rating.

I'm touch and go on stories with mermaids/selkies/sirens. They are so awkward to write about, to try to figure out logistics and such. I mean - it's not like you can actually be sexy with a fin for your lower half, right?

2029,"Unlike others(including the official ""reviewer"" for Amazon) I am not going to judge the quality of a book based on my own personal political beliefs which is what it seems has happened in 90% of the cases. To wit, if you're a liberal, it's the worst book ever written.  If you're conservative, it's just fine.

Well, no, it isn't either one, not by a long shot. SImply based on its literary qualities I can only award a one star and that is generous. Like others I loved the Ender Series, its style and cosmic theme.  The trouble with books like this is that everything is immediate.  There has not been enough time for reflection from the political split (blue vs red) to form such a conclusion.  The truest sentence in the whole book concerned that split which is really large cities vs the rest of the nation. Even states like Pennsylvania which is considered ""blue"" is geographhical red except for a few spots. But that's beside the point.

The characteers are emminently forgetful BECAUSE there is such an attempt at realism.  The scenes like imagination for the same reason.  Much of the dialogues was simply a chance for him (the author) to preach.  The whole thing reeked of a hurried schedule, sloppy craftsmanship, awful plotting and poor pleading. It was illogical considering (as he says) that the military is mostly conservative and besides, how many of the Left are armed and ready?  It makes zero sense.

Card wrote a book about how to successfully write science fiction.  Perhaps he should dust it off and stick with his forte and leave the political shenanigans to others.

1940,"Rosemary and Rue excelled in some aspects but fell flat in others. The best part was the first 100 pages, especially the prologue. The characters were interesting and the mystery, plot, and detective work were intriguing. However, the different types of creatures weren't explained. It seemed like the fae had impossible lineages like seal hydra horse, which I couldn't wrap my head around. There was nothing special about the environment, the magic, or the plot. I found nothing unique and special that set this apart from the myriad of other urban fantasies out there. Rosemary and Rue was enjoyable, and would have been much more enjoyable if the amount of suspense and detective work found in the first 100 pages carried through the book. Instead, I felt that the plot dragged horribly though the middle, and then the mystery was suddenly solved with little effort. Also, some of the decisions the main character made didn't make sense to me. Like sleeping with her old father figure/pimp? I'm not really sure I understood their relationship. I also didn't like that the main character seemed to run around blind to danger without thinking much. Overall, the mystery was pretty straight forward with little to no surprises, and the characters weren't strong enough nor likable enough for me to continue on in this series. A good fantasy read, a tolerable mystery, but nothing special.",1,"[-1.2493047890798596, 1.1280475562194043, -1.779487947600922, -1.0829132365416385, -2.425047047485964]",1.1280475562194043
2410,"Awaken is the third and final book for Liv and Dean. I loved the first book, I liked the second book, but the third book just felt repetitive to me. I think by now their story has been told and we are all ready to move on. With that said I am glad they did have a third book and the two getting the ending they deserve and I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Dean. He is all kinds of sex.

I think my problem with the third book is by now I realized that Dean and Liv have way too much sex. I was starting to think all there is to their relationship was their physical relationship and I never thought that until this book. I was double thinking everything about them. Maybe that was the authors intent but I do not think it was.

The book was 60% sex scenes and I was skimming through the pages. I really wanted to feel connected to the married couple but I couldnt. I just kept thinking Really, sexy AGAIN?!

Liv to me in this book was just annoying. Still with everything she seemed too independent on Dean. I was proud of her though when her mother came around and she stood up for herself but she did that before Dean came into the picture.

I do not know how I feel about this book. It was needed for an conclusion but I felt it did not do the couple justice at the end. I liked the ending okay but it was predicable; I was hoping to get more from Dean and Liv at the end. I also would have liked Deans family in this book. I really enjoyed them in book two maybe because they were so dysfunctional they made an interesting story.

I give Awaken (Spiral of Bliss #3) 3 Stars

6931,"This was cute but a little on the slow side. While I never quite achieved boredom, it never grabbed me either. The murderer was obvious from the beginning, though thankfully not as obvious as the red herrings might have been. Unfortunately, even they were so obvious as to be too obvious and therefore easily dismissible.

The characters were fun but not deeply developed and a little on the clich&eacute; side. The outline of a love-triangle felt unsupported and annoying (especially since I couldn't figure out why she even considered one of the men). There was no significant world-building. So, while it was entertaining it all felt very much like fluff.

The writing itself was straightforward, though the occasional abrupt shift in POV was jarring. There did seem to be a need for some further editing. I caught a lot of small mistakes, little things like the 'witch trails' instead of witch trials. Perfectly readable, but also distracting.

All in all, not a bad book but not great either. Kind of a witchy, cozy mystery. I'd read the second if I found it free, but I'm not rushing out to buy it.",1,"[-2.6870222118794604, 1.124184883563096, -1.884221704091825, -1.0771531457157955, -1.721342684241568]",1.124184883563096

First off, her bff is super annoying, and really grated on my nerves with over reacting and how she treats her friend in several scenes of this book. Also, Lemon, I don't know what it is, but she never clicked for me. I found her character very lacking, and that bothered me. Her mom is crazy, and I found her odd, but not too terrible. Also, Lemon, has this huge secret about something that happened in Seattle, but we get no backstory at all. I'm not cool with that, I think we should get all the pertinent info, and not have to sit and say, well is she ever going to tell us.
Overall, the story is cute, I'm not a fan of some of the characters, and I see no reason at all for the pet monkey. I will buy the next one, and hope it gets better.

I had to DNF at 58% because I was wondering, what now? They said their I-love-yous and even their good-byes, so what's next? And was I even curious to find out?

The answer seems to be no.

A book friend told me I'd love the chick. Mehhhh, not really. She's an odd one but not because of being an ex-thief or her secret, but that's how she comes off. She often says pointless things, randomly spits them out and I'm scratching my head, wondering how that was relevant to the story, in any way?

And let's not get into how unlike-able the hero is. He's actually repulsive and if I had to share a house with him, I'd clobber him with the frying pan, daily. Because yes, the a-hole jerk deserves no less.

But anyway, I felt zero connection to the characters, the story. I'm confused as to what's it about. The heroine's secret? The hero's secret? An important Southern family's secret? Again, I'm pondering on how some things are relevant to the story because I just don't get it. It's the first time I've read a book by this author, I have no idea how her other stories are, but this one didn't sell me on wanting to read them. I'm sorry, but her writing style isn't for me, since this comes off as more of a first draft, with things written down randomly.

2322,"Never Smile at Strangers turned out be an interesting read but it  took me a while to really get into it and achieve a sense of the author's writing style.  I initially found the introduction of so many character a tedious and a bit perplexing but eventually the necessity of each character was finally made clear.  The writing was pretty good.  There were a few  editing errors but nothing too distracting.  The plot and intensity of the mystery was really good but I felt that I had to work too hard to get to the core of  the story so I'm not sure that I would read anything else by this author.  The character development for all of the characters was also quite good.  It was nice to read a book that despite being a part of a Series was a complete stand alone read.  It's becoming increasingly difficult to find a reasonably priced novel that isn't a part of a Series especially in some of my favorite genres.

One reviewer said that this book was filled with sex.  That Is Simply Not True!  There wasn't an actual sex scene until Chapter 47 and that was not what I would call very explicit.  Yes, there are subtle recollections that allude to sexual child abuse and in one scene the killer recalls one of his victims removing her bra.  However, how anyone can truthfully imply that this is  only a good read if you like a book filled with sex is beyond me.  Moreover, it's also quite unfair to the author because some potential readers may not read this interesting thriller b/c they think that it's ""Filled with graphic sex.""  I'm not using words like captivating or enthralling to describe this story only because, as I stated earlier, the introduction of so many characters and at times the author's writing style made me feel like I had to work to hard to get to the heart of the story so much so that at one point I actually consider not finishing the book.

Nevertheless, it turned out to be a good mystery with lots of action, suspense and drama.  I was very happy that I didn't know who the killer was until it was revealed.

Not only were the sloped areas that one would expect rinsed clean but the flatter barren area had washed out into the grassy area that didn't need  to be reseeded!

In hindsight if I were to use this ""self mulching"" seed again, not only would I scratch up the surface like I did, I would also add some topsoil on top to have something with more weight hold it in place and scattered some straw on top like we did when we originally seeded our lawn after building our house, to give it a bit more insurance that is would stay where we planted it! We did not have this issue when we used the scratched up surface and liberally scattered straw over the seeds. This ""mulch"" part of this product did not hold up to the rain in our situation.

This new release has some murky and untouched scenes, though, the restoration has cleaned it up better than any other previous release. Most scenes are fairly detailed and quite a bit better than any other I have seen. I can't really remember what the theatrical version looked like but this is about as close as it will come. Softness resides and it is clear it probably needs a new master from the negative.

The color timing seems to be an issue for some. The older DVD was ridiculously cool and they seem to have restored a good deal of the natural, warmer coloration some were looking for. It may still seem off as do some of the other coloring choices for their other films but to me it isn't a huge deal as we at least have a decent presentation of this adventure classic. In my opinion people can at least rest easy it doesn't look like the old DVD in most scenes.

She is an author that I continually suggest to my reader friends, because she writes her characters and stories in such a way, that makes them just come to life right I front of your eyes!  This book is my second favorite book, with Let Love Heal being my first.  That's not to say that this story is any less powerful and passionate...it's just that the main character of LLH struck such a personal chord for me.  Let Love Be is a MUST READ for those who have lost hope in ever finding another one true love.  Once again, Melissa brings you right into the lives of the characters in her book and teaches about great friendship, strong family units, unyielding love, passion, and faith, and tremendous courage in all of life's unseen paths.  Are there love scenes?  Yes there are, and once again, Melissa doesn't disappoint.  With Reid and Maddie there were all the awkward ""firsts"".  Melanie and Bryan dealt with all the awkward moments that stem from low ""self-image"".  Finally, with Lucy and Bryan, you learn that over 40 just makes the love that more strong and passionate...and they get it JUST RIGHT!  If you have not read any of Melissa's books, then may I suggest that you put the book that you're reading now down...right this minute and begin reading her books.  They are a must, and although you will cry a lot (I always joke and tell her that her books should come with a 1-2-or 3 box of Kleenex warning), your soul will be much better in the end for reading it.

I am the caretaker of a feral cat colony. I have tried it on 7 feral cats and they are not even crazy about it. They eat it but not eagerly. I poured the bag in a food bin and every time I scoop it out, there is oil in the scooper and also on the plate. It is heavy with oils. It even smells disgusting.

Montag came across as weak and pathetic, even when he was rebelling and supposedly thinking for himself for a change. And the minor characters all irritated me to no end.

1657,"The Library at Mount Char is an oddity of a book.  It's a mix of genres, mostly fantasy and thriller, but with a story arc that's a bit tricky to pin down and characters that I found difficult to connect with.  Let me put it this way, if chapter one doesn't hook you or simply horrifies you, that's a good place to stop.  I powered on and kind of wish I hadn't.  It's not so much that I did not like the book, more that there was not a clear sense of direction most of the time.  Between the chapters there are often interludes that fill in some character's back story, but two of the characters seem thrown into the text without a sense of direction for much of the first half.  They also seemed very much two sides of the same coin, so despite their differences, the purpose of them was oddly similar.

The second half unravels much of what the first half builds, but even that is not entirely satisfactory and goes walkabout bogging down the narrative.  Much of the story comes through dialogue which keeps the pace up but doesn't always give solid answers to questions.  I'm still not sure what the purpose of the story was or who the main character is meant to be at the end.  The description from the publisher does not exactly match what Scott Hawkins delivers in this book.  There are complex ideas that never fully coalesce and plenty of times that events stretch belief even within the fantasy setting.  Basically, one needs to suspend disbelief the moment the book starts or it comes out a hodge podge of genres and ideas that don't untangle.

Sometimes when I'm in the middle of a less-than-fantastic book for a review, I look longingly at that shelf and then hurry myself along (I'm also a one-at-a-time kind of girl). So, when I finished the book last week and needed something to read, it shouldn't have been hard to pick something.

I read (or skimmed) The Scarlet Letter in high school.  B-O-R-I-N-G! After I fell in  love with The Peabody Sisters  (which I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys biographies and literature) several years ago, I was anxious to try some more Hawthorne (he was married to the youngest Peabody sister). I started The House of the Seven Gables but put it aside when I just couldn't get into it after fifty pages. Even though I really really wanted to like Hawthorne, I figured it was hopeless.

Perhaps I just wasn't ready or mature enough then. I devoured The Scarlet Letter this time. I was enthralled and fascinated with the story, themes and the beautiful language (makes reading most novels now seem like fifth grade work). I almost wish I was back in high school college so that I could discuss it with a group. I definitely have some ideas to contribute this time.

It was a wonderful and delightful read!!
It was entertaining..It was fun..Yet it was adventurous..
It was well written and I enjoyed it !!...It would be a nice movie,too...

However,I didn't like the ending very much..It left me hanging,but in a bad way..Plus,we didn't see any progress on Kid's relationships with others,like Smokey and Electra..Practically he interacted with Mouse or his family...It just wasn't enough...

It wasn't into the beginning of it, but I thought when the flu started killing people off that it was going to get really good, but it didn't go the way I was hoping. I'm not really sure what I was hoping for really.

I thought the idea of a traveling symphony going around after the collapse was very original. I give all of my stars to that, because it's just a really cool concept to me.

I didn't really relate to any of the characters. I know, what is wrong with me right? I think with the going back and forth with the time frame is what got to me. I like that thing in most books, but not so much this one.

Oh well, to each their own and I'm glad so many people could get more out of it than I did because that is what is so wonderful about reading :)

Yes, it has a sexy lead male, intimate scenes that have you shifting in your seat, and many other aspects that we all love, but this one felt so much more personal. For me, Willow is an extremely relatable character. Pieces of her live in all of us. Even those that project confidence or conceit, have self doubt that can't be seen by others.

Willow struggles with her self worth and a 'family' that viciously feeds those insecurities. Her situation broke my heart, but the growth that followed gave me the warm and fuzzies. This book shows how determination and the love of others can give you the drive to overcome the inner battles we all face from time to time.

Kane... I struggled to find another word to describe him other than perfect. Because if this book teaches us anything at all, it's that no one is perfect. He's loyal, caring, gentle, patient, supportive, determined, and one of the most swoon worthy characters I have read in a long time.

9582,"You can't replace the original cast of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"", but if you're going to do a movie ""remake"", this is about as good as you could do.

Cloris Leachman channeled Irene Ryan to perfection.

Jim Varney didn't try to channel Buddy Ebsen, and that was for the best. It would have never worked. However, he captured the quiet and naive dignity of Jed Clampett very successfully.

Ellie May is probably the least challenging of the roles, and Erica Eleniak did a good job.

Dabney Coleman was the perfect ""type casting"" for Drysdale. All he had to do was give his normal sleazy businessman performance, and he delivered.

Lily Tomlin was a bit over the top as Jane Hathaway, but that's what you expect, and what you get, from Lily Tomlin.

The only casting I thought missed in big way was Diedrich Bader as Jethro. I just never bought his characterization.

The plot hit on several tropes from the early years of the TV show, and I enjoyed that:
* turning Ellie May into a lady
* Jed finding a mother for her
* unscrupulous people out to swindle Jed
* the whole ""fish out of water"" genre treatment

What do you mean?  The whole story is based upon Pendergast's search for his long-believed deceased wife.  Once we get the truth about Helen Pendergast's death, another event occurs which makes the earlier part of the book redundant.  I am not a fan of authors who use the ending of a 300+ page tome as a cliffhanger.

Why not 4-stars?  The effort to include Vincent D'Agosto was painful.  There was no reason to include that character here at all.  Also, the inclusion of two other characters was all set-up material for a future book, and had no business being in this book.

Any other highlights?  Pendergast is always an unusual protagonist who manages to come up with very creative solutions to difficult problems.  The pacing and dialogue were superb.

Being a shortish (179 p) book, and being based around themes of marriage and adultery, you might be expecting a fairly easy read. It certainly isn't that, not least because the narrator (the wronged husband) doesn't start at the start and work through chronologically. Little snippets come out, but your assumptions about what is meant may be incorrect...

Who is good and who is bad? Again, the narrator's conclusions may surprise you. The characters are deeply layered, meriting a second read through.

1901,"Iles continues to amaze me.  In some ways his books are the same, yet they're not.  Usually they grab me at the start and then run away screaming as they drag me behind.  This one is a bit different.  Initially I got this Thorton Wilder/Our Town sort of view with a dead body, as seen from the clouds, and then it morphed into a present tense interaction.  Initially it built a bit slower, but panned out into a full blown story with myriad facets.

The premise is a star high school girl turns up dead, and its uncovered that she was having an affair with the prominent town doctor and community hero.  The question is did he kill her? If not him?...then who did.  In the meantime the county legal staff is trying to crucify him for their own political gain, and the small town rumour mill is churning, making up what it can't find out or finds too mundane.  Iles makes some poignant points about what is too large an age difference. If a 40 year old is involved with a 60 year old, we don't bat an eyelash, but if an 18 year old is involved with a 38 year old, well, that just plain outrageous. Is it?...well...that depends on the people involved.  Iles also takes a bit of a run at southern racial prejudice, it's causes and its current results.  Since Iles is from Natchez, I'll take this book as an insiders view of how the deep south functions (not being a southerner myself).

Its a good whodunnit without all the cliche trappings of a detective novel.  Anyone who has read Iles before will probably find this deeply engaging, and enjoyable.",1,"[-0.8113680276676923, 1.0149955632588226, -1.839245040659456, -1.0844536132606322, -1.7494445150598428]",1.0149955632588226

9568,"I am a child of the 80s and I spent a good amount of time during my childhood in various video arcades.  So when I saw this movie, I knew right away that I wanted to see it.  But really its nothing special.  Its got the typical Adam Sandler formula in it.  Hes an average guy shown in his average life doing an average job.  He meets a girl and tries to start a relationship with her but she shuns him.  But over the course of the movie, she learns that he is special.  The girl then comes around, gives him a chance and they end up together in the end.

The jokes are just okay and the acting is also just okay.  Parts of it are worse than others.  I mean can you really see Kevin James as the President of the United States?  Somehow I cant see the same actor who played The Zookeeper and Paul Blart as the leader of the free world.

The graphics of the game characters seemed like the makers of this movie were just trying too hard.  Seriously, how much can you touch up or polish Pac Man or Q*Bert?  Theyre just blobs of one color with dots for eyes in those old games.  Also I have to question why Mario is only in this movie for like 2 seconds?  And hes in the background at that!  I kind of thought in a movie that is about video games from the early 80s that he would be more prominent in the story.

All in all its just a movie that is okay.  It does give you a feeling of nostalgia for these games as you are watching the movie, but really the movie is just so bland that you find yourself just wishing you could be playing these old games.  And if you really want to do that you can download them on your smartphone for a few bucks or you can find videos of people playing them online.

There are very few other characters who have speaking parts in the book, with the exception of the New York section, where Alices crass editor ex-boyfriend nearly gets flattened by the tough ex-con best-selling author.

The pace is slow, with a lot of internal monologues, but enough of it is externalized that they're really getting to know each other. Ive read books where so much takes place in the characters minds, its like theres no exterior time for lovers to get to know each other, but thats not true in this story. Its quiet, with no melodrama, no car chases, no serial killers, no fires or kidnappings. Its just them, getting to know each other through sex and talking. And letters. He writes actual letters.

2205,"If written by any other author, reviewers would heap hosannas upon Slade House.  It is clever, intriguing, and simply wonderful on many levels.  As usual, Mitchell is amusing and sympathetic, bending genre and cross-pollinating new works with old characters.  Depending upon your point of view Slade House is either derivative or an extension of David Mitchell's last novel The Bone Clocks.  This will be extremely irritating to fans who have spent the last ten years looking for another Cloud Atas and instead seem to have gotten BC Lite.

I reject that criticism of Slade House.  It is neither 'lite' nor derivative.  The story began as a series of tweets about a boy visiting a strange house with his mother.  It built into a short story.  It has become Slade House.  The author who delights us bending genre has done something I think hilariously subversive and wonderful: Mitchell is now writing 'fan fiction' to himself.  The idea is absolutely brilliant and his critics need to get off their high horses and stop whining a story like Slade House lacks intellectual heft.

Henry James wrote 'ghost stories', (which at the time of their writing were dismissed by many but now beloved) why not Mitchell? Like James' tales (which weren't scary either--not every ghost story has to be chilling),  Mitchell is plumbing the depths of psychological mystery, not the bloody horror of Carrie.  Finally, the criticism that he might have written something to make money is just stupid.  Presumably his critics chose their professions to make money; are writers any less entitled to pay their mortgage or support their family? Questioning somebody's integrity because one doesn't fully appreciate what an author is attempting is a low blow.

That said, Slade House is hardly a perfect work.  The way the book is structured-- 5 chronologically ordered chapters, 50-60 pages each about a character or characters is problematic.  Just when one starts to know or feel connected to an individual, they disappear.  The author might argue his point is we shouldn't have to know humans personally to care about them--a valid point for sure.  The argument doesn't, however,  satisfy the desire of a reader to enter the fictive world of the character.  In that essential way, Slade House is lacking and a bit disappointing.

If imperfect, Slade House is still perfectly charming.  Mitchell continues to impress build upon a body of work that now, seven novels on, is really quite dazzling.",1,"[-1.559380191991312, 0.9943529682099449, -1.9996148030548824, -1.0557421999978103, -1.7525372045217158]",0.9943529682099449

I finished this book days ago and I still don't know how to write this review. I have never read E.K. Blair before, but I will be checking out some of her other books, she is a phenomenal writer. As for the story I am torn, I've been aggravated by it and I can't figure out why. Why did Anonymous need her story told? Why didn't she just write it, as fiction. Why is the ending the way it is? On some very out of this world level I can almost, ALMOST relate to her story, where it started. It's hard being a mom and wife, we lose ourselves very easily. So when we get ANY kind of positive attention towards us, the woman we have long forgotten it feels nice, amazing even. But then you remember who you are, what you have, and how hard you worked to get there. From the story there wasn't anything really in her life that should have made her so unhappy to go as far as she did. I am not judging her, I am not mad at her nor do I hate her. I am just not understanding how she went that far with everything she had. There were parts of the story that made no sense to me, parts I didn't quite understand why they were there. I had a slew of different emotions while reading, E.K. Blair did an amazing job pulling me in, connecting me to the story, and making me feel things. Things I didn't want to feel sometimes. As far Anonymous' best friend in the story, I am shocked, I can sort of see why she would be there and support her but at the same time I think to myself I could never ever watch my best friend self destruct, live that way, and not try my damndest to get her help.

257,"I am a fan of Dennis Lehane, having read  innumerable books by him. This one, however, almost did not get finished.
I started reading this book several months ago. It started slow, but then I reconciled that feeling to knowing that this author is a consummate developer of plot and character development. So, I persisted, even though I could not for the life of me understand where he was going.
I put the book down twice. My habit is if I put a book down three times I will not finish it. But then I told myself, this is Dennis Lehane! So what gives?
After finishing several other books and doing reviews on each in the interim, I decided to give this book one more effort. That was when I was 50% into the read. Now, let me say this. Because Lehane's plots are so tight, I was able to leave and then return without having to re read pages. In other words, the story stayed with me (no matter how confusing I considered it to be).
In retrospect, I'm glad I went back. From the point where I last left off to the end the book it had me captivated. Again, This is Lehane the master character and plot developer at work (I mean The Given Day--are you kidding me?!).
When I finished, the whole point of the story came to me in a flash. Characters and plot all came together. Rising action reached a climax. Falling action and resolution fell into place and, once again, I was taken in by the quality of writing by this writer.
I don't re tell story lines in my reviews. But I must say to those of you who are struggling with this book, or have decided to not finish it, thinking like I did, that it was a baffling experience. Go back and finish it. You will be amply rewarded. I promise.",1,"[-0.10690072475293033, 0.9730700868434442, -2.3304114798910134, -1.095962749862544, -0.923653406282485]",0.9730700868434442

2934,"Sometimes I love Stephen King, sometimes not so much.  This book is a not-so-much, though I will give Mr. King credit for going outside his usual comfort zone of bizarre horror -- which he does very well, thank you.  Here, he does a more-or-less conventional mystery involving a retired cop who's still trying to solve the one major crime he failed to solve before retirement; a very deranged man who revels in mass murder and other weirdnesses; and a crew of hangers-on of various types.

Stephen King can certainly write, and the book is easy enough to get through.  The problem is that, given his fame and more importantly his success, no one ever really edits his writing.  As a result, the book is overly long, filled with unnecessary details -- including what may or may not be product endorsements -- which combine to make it rather predictable both in terms of character, plot and dialogue.

Other reviewers have commented on the predictability of the tale, so I won't go into that here except to say that they're right. What I will go into is how totally cliched the characters are; the retired cop who's gained weight and drinks too much; the wealthy, gorgeous woman he takes into his confidence (among other places); the super-bright kid and neurotic middle-aged woman who end up helping him; and so on.  None of them is a character; instead, they are all ""types"", and as such they are boring.

When you combine a predictable plot with boring characters and just too many words, what you get is not a very interesting mix.",1,"[-1.3813351062701567, 0.9693952679869317, -1.8263450596649287, -1.0844812602690788, -1.3203924039259687]",0.9693952679869317

9464,"Limitless is a movie (and later a short lived TV series) based on the urban legend that people can only access a fraction of their brain's power/function/potential.  Bradley Cooper plays the typical movie version of a down on his luck guy named Eddie Morra, who is dead broke, wears ratty clothes etc.  He is a writer trying to finish a book and he comes across a drug called NZT, which allows a person taking it to access 100% of their brain's ability, turning them into an instant genius.

Through a series of events that I will not detail so as not to spoil it, Eddie becomes a highly successful financial wizard, but the side effects of the drug, getting in bad with a loan shark, and the perils of the big money financial world all end up getting in his way.  The story is not what I would call overly complex and does take a bit of suspension of disbelief to accept, but it is entertaining enough that it is easy to enjoy.  The acting is also very good with Cooper having to play a range of life situations for Eddie, and hold his own against Robert DeNiro.

For those who get the blu-ray, the movie looks and sounds great.  For extras there are a couple short making of and behind the scenes features.  An extended edition of the movie that really just adds a total of a couple minutes to the theatrical version run time, but does not change the story, a commentary track by the director, and an alternate ending.  The alternate ending actually leads much better into the TV series than the original ending that both the theatrical and extended edition show.  All in all, good for what is there.

Like I said it is not a complex story.  It is good to watch for any fan of the show, because while it is not necessary to get what is going on in the show, it is nice to see the backstory of the character of Eddie, who only makes brief almost cameo appearances in the television series.  It is a good way to spend an hour and  a half or so if you are looking for something different to watch.",1,"[-1.3026949325321153, 0.9609753213954412, -2.288784424442684, -1.0689452770280778, -1.0190648885993545]",0.9609753213954412

9487,"I will say ""The Divide"" wastes absolutely no time in getting started. Without any opening credits we see a mushroom cloud forming over the NYC skyline and an apartment building's residents making a mad dash to a bunker in the basement.

And that is about the only positive thing I can say for the film. The following 2 hours is just mind numbingly dull as we watch the survivors of the initial blast yell, fight and in general be mean to each other. That's it, that is the whole story. 9 people argue and torture each other over food, over sex, over...well just about over anything and everything.

Apparently a nuclear armageddon turns most males into drunken bully frat boys, while most women sit around and stare at things. ""The Divide"" takes a promising cast and wastes them. You'll hate all of the characters, none have any redeeming value, and at the end of the film you ask yourself ""Do I really want any of these people to survive?""

Yes, this is one of those books.  I read straight through not stopping until i flipped the last page and even then I was still with the characters of the story.  I literally can't say enough good things about It Ends With Us.  This was a 5++++ Star read.  Easily one of my top favorites of the entire year so far!

It Ends with Us was gorgeous, profound, mesmerizing, raw, captivating and inspiring. Those words don't even do this book justice. No words can put how I felt and am STILL feeling into perspective for you. I can't remember the last time I read something that was that powerful. It's one of those books that I will recommend every single friend of mine read and even if they aren't my friend I am going to tell them about it. I felt this book deep down in my bones, my heart, my mind. I felt it EVERYWHERE because it consumed me. It's a book that has taken residence deep down within me and I know without a doubt I will never ever forget it.

There is not a sliver of doubt that It Ends with Us is Colleen Hoover's best work yet. I am pretty sure many will agree after reading about Lily, Ryle and Atlas.

I wasn't completely sure why this book was 'MC' until halfway through the book so I spent the first half confused. It's also easy to guess everything that happens, or what's going to happen and that was a little disappointing. I like to feel it keeps me guessing and then shocks me into oblivion, but this one didn't.

Dani...I liked her in the first half of the book; she was sweet, kind and generous. Second half? I despised her quite a bit. She flies off the handle at every little tiny thing and she's pretty darn violent. If I was Zane, I would have run miles away and never gave her a second look. Yes, he deserved a busted nose but beyond that? She took everything out on him and it was frustrating that he stayed around with 'doormat' tattooed on his forehead. I understand, she's had a pretty crap time of it but that's what the gym she goes to is for. But no, poor Zane gets the brunt everytime. I feel her anger is misplaced in a lot of areas and her attitude would repel the best of people.

I salute Zane, I do. How he put up with her childish antics is beyond me. I felt the book moved quite fast after all the initial getting to to know the characters and everything they grew up doing and feeling. Sex scenes were rushed and only lasted two paragraphs, there was no emotion, really, that went into it...It felt like a 'wam bam, thank you ma'am' kind of thing, that's an area that can be easily looked over etc.

I did like the storyline and my heart DID go out to Dani in the first half, it's terrible what happened to her and her emotions, though a little unrealistic, showed us how she was feeling through the how ordeal.

I am giving 3 stars , because the prices suck. You have to pay $3.99 for each book.  To read all the books it will cost $19.95. That is $10 less then my cell phone bill.
I do not think they are worth that much.

It does drag, I think a lot of book that has a lot of chapters the plot drags out to much.

2925,"When I read the summary for The Replacement Wife by Eileen Goudge, I got a little bit of a thrill inside. It'd been a while since I had read a straight-up chick lit book and I was craving some emotional, doesn't-require-a-lot-of-thought, reading and thought this would fit the bill perfectly.

What I was unprepared for was the completely unseen twist that the book would take halfway through and send me spiraling into rage instead of pleasure.

But I cannot blame that on Eileen Goudge, or the story, because when all was said and done, the book delivered what it was supposed to deliver. There was romance, heartbreak, contemporary themes about marriage, struggles and triumphs - I just didn't like who experienced some of these things.

Y'all, I've never been so disappointed in a character in my life. Just bad, bad choices and all I could think is - why? Why did you do this to these poor, innocent people in the book, Ms. Goudge?!

I think if you are looking for a summer read that has the potential to get you worked up in a rage sort of way, The Replacement Wife is a good choice. I didn't cry while reading this book (I sob like a baby when I read Cecelia Aherns and was hoping for a similar reaction here), but it did inspire a reaction from me. I'm just glad I wasn't on the beach when I started yelling at the pages.",1,"[-1.6935942712548675, 0.9326105478673054, -2.380847258397898, -1.0735522429328228, -1.3258863724379482]",0.9326105478673054
4356,"This is my first time reading Robert Masello and while he is a wonderful storyteller, I couldn't help thinking he tried to do too much in this book. The historical aspects and fictionalizing Jack the Ripper and Stevenson was impressive but it got lost with all the shifting between past and present. I love time-travel novels but it didn't work here. By the time I was finished, I needed something to calm my stomach.

Thank you to Netgalley and 47North for giving me an ARC in the hopes I'd review it.",1,"[-1.402907710379068, 0.9323228490399923, -2.3804920828777196, -1.1044995139849723, -1.2129655483539887]",0.9323228490399923

I am so glad that I did get it because I loved the story as well, I love reading books that are heartwarming. This book was beautifully written that it gave me all the feels and I felt like I was feeling all the emotions that the characters were feeling as well.
Oliver was a sweet and sexy guy that mad me swoon many times. Elle i absolutely adored reading about. This was such a sweet read and cant wait to read the next in the heart series.",4,"[-3.3269181057606554, -2.5781044480986153, -3.4669487164501076, -1.0918018353849475, 0.93198320848739]",0.93198320848739
4341,"While I really loved the first book in this series as it featured a null and a main heroine with no paranormal abilities, this second book was less ground breaking. Charlie (the null) wasn't really in this story, and Lex isn't a plain-Jane human anymore. These changes put this book strictly into regular UF territory, and while it was exciting and fun, its wasn't as original.

Lex has a lot on her plate this book, with vampires going missing, werewolves intruding into the territory, and a whole lot of issues with the witches. All this action means something is always happening or evolving, so there isn't a dull moment in the book.

The only issue I had with this book, other than the lack of nulls, was the developing relationship between Lex and Quinn. Dont get me wrong, I like Quinn, but a sexual relationship with a vampire just comes across as icky.

Overall, it was a good read, but not really unique. I was so excited about how the series started, so I hope the next book brings that back.",1,"[-1.9483537164961255, 0.9316327587800309, -1.9426915076911646, -1.0614857398505086, -2.0616794770036035]",0.9316327587800309
