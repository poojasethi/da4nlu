I normally read between 100 - 150 pages a day (sometimes more) and it took me 4 days to get to page 25! I thought the book cover was real cute and the storyline sounded great. I just couldn't get a feel for the characters and it seemed a little scattered to me.

Just in the 50 pages I did read the one thing I did like was her strange addiction to Jelly Bellies and her talk about the different flavors. This was cute and fun.

  ""I like margarita, but you can keep the coconut - tastes like soap.""

It features a slim design so it can fit in tight places. It lasts about four hours per charge and doesn't dim very much as the charge goes down.  Which leads me to the two things I dislike about it.  One, the unit I received for review flickers quite a lot, and it's VERY noticeable when working on objects near the light.  It tends to stop flickering near the end of the charge..  It's annoying, but it's possible I simply got a defective unit.  Second, there is no warning that I can detect when the charge gets low. The unit just turns off completely until you recharge it.  A pre-warning flashing red LED on the unit would be a big help to anticipate its impending shutoff.

The other disappointment was that there was no ending.

The narrator, David Patrick Kelly appeared to have an almost Southern lilt to his voice at the outset of the story that came across like an attempted impersonation of Matthew McConaughey, but as the story progressed he did gather momentum as he changed the tone and inflection of his reading and ultimately did a pretty good job with the material he was given.

And now - on to my opinion of the story itself.  I can probably sum it up in one concise word, LACKING.  It is lacking in character development, lacking in a cohesive plot and definitely lacking in credibility. Why even the ""romance"" is lacking from what I assume is intended to be the romantic aspect of the tale.

What is not lacking in this telling is a seemingly indestructible protagonist who has more lives than Bruce Willis in a Die Hard movie as well as a plethora of scenarios depicting guts and gore. If folks dying via gunshot wounds, car crashes, being thrown from a balcony, having a bomb strapped to their back or having their eyeballs expertly cut out in the middle of a busy restaurant are things that get your juices flowing- well then, this is the book for you.

Then I read the review in The New Yorker, which was much more favorable, so I said to myself that if The New Yorker liked it that much, I should give it a chance.  My gut instinct was right.  The premise is interesting, and some parts of the book were nicely done, but overall it was really no better than so-so.

The book's problems include that (1) the basic premise, while interesting, is somewhere between real and alternate history, so it's not possible to suspend disbelief; and (2) major aspects of the plot (womanizing young Jack Kennedy falls for a gorgeous, mysterious and very tough broad) and the dialogue are so trite that it seems like something out of a bygone era (and I don't mean that as a compliment).

I was so frustrated that Karou and Akiva barely saw each other. They spent the majority of the book apart. Were the angels really angels? Because I felt they were as evil as the chimeras.

9275,"This film reminds me of Gaspar Noe's Irreversible, in that it's initially an assault on the senses, and you feel as if you've seen great filmmaking because of it.  When I revisisted Irreversible recently, I found out I'd been had.  Noe's film is just an assault on the senses with nothing in its core.  Aronofsky's film, while nowhere as overly graphic, sadistic or disgusting as Irreversible, has this same quality.

As many have said here, the main message here is a very simplistic one, DRUGS ARE BAD.  It's almost on the level of an after school special, and that's a shame, as Aronofsky has a very good visual and editing style, but after nearly 2 hours of it, it's overkill.  I felt totally numbed after seeing this film.  I sat in my car afterwards, and I couldn't move.  But aside from the pure visceral experience of the film (which feels like a drug, the drugs the movie is telling us not to use), there isn't much left there.  There's some depth in Ellen Burstyn's character (she gives a great performance), but I believe that has to do with the fact this is based on Hubert Selby Jr.'s book.  If there is any humanism in this film, it's derived from the novel, not Aronofsky, who is like a kid with his new toy.  The characters of Leto and Connelly are especially bad, especially Connelly.  She is supposed to be a junkie, but she looks way too beautiful to be one.  Overall, the film is worth watching at least once, but it's essentially a visceral assault on your senses and little else.

A funny sidenote...Before this film screened (I saw it in a theater), the theater was playing The Wallflowers's album Breach, which is one of my favorite albums of theirs.  After I recovered from this assault, I kept thinking about how wonderful and tuneful those songs were, and I pretty much forgot about Aronofsky's film (until I wrote this review).

I hadn't seen ""Live at Pompeii"" in many, many years. I didn't even know that a new ""Director's Cut"" had been released, so I was quite intruiged by this.

""Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii"" (171 min.) starts off with the ""Director's Cut"" (91 min; in 16:9 widescreen). I was a little surprised to see all the additional space footage, I mean how weird is it to see International Space Station footage from (I'm guessing) the 1990s in a concert film that was filmed in late 71/early 72! I also couldn't quite understand the logic behind adding footage (not concert footage, even) from the band messing around at Abbey Studios on various ""Dark Side of the Moon"" material. All rather strange. The original film (60 min; in 4:3 full screen) is also included, thankfully. While I prefer watching the widescreen ""refit"", the original shorter movie makes a lot more sense musically and thematically. ""Echoes Part I"" and ""Echoes Part II"" bookend the fantastic Pompeii-filmed set.

Am I the only one to think that as it relates to the Pompeii-filmed footage, Nick Mason had an inordinate amount of screen time? I'm thinking as much as the other three combined. You can't as much as catch a glimpse of Roger Waters until well into ""Echoes Part I"" for some reason.

8999,"I have a love-hate-kind of dislike relationship with this book. I loved it because it was the Sinners but I hated it because it was the end. The thing I disliked is i felt like there was this huge part of the storyline that was just swept under the rug unresolved.

Maci was a big part of the story of Danny and Skye. And there is one part where Maci says something that could have been a huge deal. But it's like it'd never ever addressed. So if it wasn't being addressed why did it happen. Someone can't run their mouth, say something like that and we done a- shut a b! tch down or 2- mention it to the man. We don't just never talk about it ever again. Also, her wall home. Why did that happen if it was never brought up again and everything was fine and dandy. Why did he always make her feel like it was his job if it was never discussed. Just alot felt like it was left unfinished. Loose ends that should have been tied up.
The other thing I didn't like about this is now that the clubs merged, I don't know who is who. When names were given and people were upset, I had no idea who they were...but they kind of sounded like they mattered.  It's almost like we need a family tree. There is just too many people involved at this point.

I think the relationship between Danny and Skye was heartbreaking in the beginning. What she did. The heart shattering run ins they would have. It was just hard. I'm glad they made it through, but boy did Skye make a job out of running. It seemed like she spent the first half running from everything at every turn.

This is not a police procedural, just a good story.

9399,"I watched this with a friend of mine who is very forgiving of modern comedies...and he thought it was as wretched as I did.

There are so many things that are so wrong about this movie but the worst aspect of ROLE MODELS is that it is NOT funny.

I don't know who Paul Rudd is, but he has zero screen presence.  I sat through his abysmal movie THE TEN and could not for the life of me understand what kind of person would laugh at that.  In ROLE MODELS, he plays a selfish jerk with no redeeming qualities.  He's not funny.  His acting is flat.  His character goes nowhere.  You never believe for a second that a severely-wasted Elizabeth Banks could ever care about a lout like him.

My friend turned me about halfway through and asked, ""Do you think the studio people screened this and thought they had a winner here?""
To the people who made this movie, it's all about formulas and the deal.  Get Stiffler from AMERICAN PIE and McLovin from SUPERBAD and you can't miss...no matter how awful the final product is.

I hated SUPERBAD, which had absolutely zero laughs in it.  Although ROLE MODELS did manage to have a couple of weak chuckles, it had so many dead air misfires that it was more embarrassing than SUPERBAD.

Another lame, horrible ""comedy"" by someone (Paul Rudd) whose talent has been exhausted (like Seth Rogan) and yet they keep making movie after movie.  That's Hollywood.

Yes, the Greek navy smashed the Persian force at Salamis.  Yes, there was a woman commander named Artemesia(though she was not in overall command and is best known for cutting through one of the other Persian ships, sending it to the bottom, as she fled).  And the Persians did burn Athens.  Aside from that, the movie was utter nonsense.
Then again, it is based on the gendre of ""graphic novels"", which are essentially comic books for adults who never learned to read in schools(working too hard on their self-esteem and too little on their studies?).  For this reason, I had low expectations.
It did, however, have lots of action and a mediocre plot so it is good for mindless entertainment",1,"[-2.3273888275879124, 2.0245692227334815, -1.7030974340152019, -1.10494132061469, -2.4935743338696934]",2.0245692227334815

1982,"This (hopefully) last ""Legend"" tale was the worst.  Like other reviewers, I devoured the original series and even liked the three ""family"" series.  But something changed in the ""Legends"" Series - the story not only got off track but introduced elements that were disconcerting in the least.

Where to start? The sadism was so bad that when Erasmus or one of the Titans drew near to a human I skipped ahead, unable to stand any more elevated rationalizations from these monsters. Besides, we are never told why they act as they do - what drove them to this madness? Speaking of madness, the cult of Serena was one of the wackiest ever.  The idea of unarmed mobs taking over a governnment was absurd.

Then we had those interminable battle scenes that were the epitomy of dullness. The conversations among the robots were  ridiculous, more like something on Mystery Science Theater. There were too many characters and the hero (Vor Atriedes)remained distant, never acquiring a personality.  Also the characters made decisions totally ""out of character"" again and again. The writing style (three pages/chapter) is annoying, making it seem like a series of vignettes instead of a seamless tale.

On the plus side, we learn the origins of the Spacing Guild  (Norma, my favorite character, appeared briefly). The origins of the Bene Geserit - more an accident than a purposeful event - was a good saga. We learn why the Harkonnens are hated, the Atriedes admired and the Corrinos in command. I hope the authors move on to other things...drop the robots, the battles and get on with the mythology.",1,"[-1.7356156779147291, 2.0093000618088626, -1.753705197731153, -1.1152870081799655, -2.337254573368915]",2.0093000618088626

Ms. Wecker has the germ of a good fantasy novel; as a result, parts of ""The Golem and the Jinni"" are OK.

Writing a novel take skill and the ability to tell an interesting story.  First person point of view wears very quickly.  Authors must learn patience, how to introduce ideas, the right level of detail, keeping the reader's attention and characters who are not caricatures.  Most of all they must learn to let the story tell itself instead of force feeding the reader every minute  shard.

What's missing is any sense of nuance.  Jack and his kids are perfect, almost able to leap buildings with a single bound. And that mind-numbing detail!!!  It illustrates my point that there is no real story other than survival and fighting zombies.  The best such stories actually have a plot with character who develop and do things - The Stand, The Road, Lucifer's Hammer, the Last Ship (the 1988 novel), On The Beach, etc  There is no way to mask that the detail attempts to hide the lack of any real plot.

This was not the case here, unfortunately. I did NOT dislike the book, I found it ""good enough"" and it did keep me interested.

The problem I had with it was that it felt very scattered to me and confusing, hard to follow. I kept having to refer to the ""cheat sheet"" list of characters in the back of the book, Thank you Cindy for that page, without it I would have really been lost.
Usually in a book there is a plot and maybe a sub-plot. I felt that there were really 4 plots to this book. Any one of them would have made a very good story in itself, but thrown all-together it was kind of hard for me to follow. At one time I even flipped the page back and forth looking at the page numbers, sure I had missed a page.
I loved the story of Lena, the school teacher, and wished she had focused more on that story alone.
I also felt that way too much was happening at the same time in that small Amish community. I found myself saying ""Wow this community is crazy!"" again, any one thing would have been great, but I felt it was too much going on to be believable.

More often than not, Dream Theater sounds like they simply borrow bits from all the other prog rock bands out there, and try to mesh into their own style, but it doesn't work at all, at least not on this CD/album.  I recognise the influences here.  When I'm listening to the album, I can hear Metallica, Rush, ELP, Yes, Pink Floyd, and even Ravi Shankar/Indian influences.  But, unfortunately, the influences don't really mess.  They're all over the place without becoming cohesive, and the album doesn't work at all.  The musicianship is generally very good, but it feels cold and mechanical.  The lyrics are tremendously pedestrian and borderline stupid.  The lead vocalist is desperately trying to bring emotion to the awful lyrics, and he ends up making them worse.  There is one tremendous song that I have played over and over again, and that's Beyond this Life.  Even though the lyrics and singing aren't very good, the music on that one track is fantastic.

4395,"Never Never is the first installment in co-authors Colleen Hoover and Tarryn Fisher's mature young adult series titled: Never Never. When I finished this book, I was pissed. But after sitting on it for a few days, I think I can write a fair review. Because there's good and bad in everything right?

The good: I finished the book! Something good about it kept me going. It was mysterious and intriguing to follow these characters as they tried to make some sense out of this situation and re-learn both themselves and others around them. I was supportive of the characters' slow but sure attraction to each other, despite what they gradually learned about their past behavior. The characters have potential and apparent motivation to be better than the person they were, and I liked that about them. I was genuinely curious, and very eager to get my many, many questions answered. That combined with my emotional response after finishing the book, although quite negative, at least shows that I was very much invested in the story.

The bad: I was confused! The concept that the characters' situation was based on made no sense at all. (See spoiler) From the first page to the last page, I had so many questions that went unanswered...and then the stupid cliffhanger! It was unnecessary. Why publish a 140 page book that ends right in the middle of a climactic scene instead of just publishing a full-length novel that allows the reader to gain a full experience? And the next installment won't be released until May 2015??? I think Never Never should be marketed as a serial instead of a series...that would make more sense and would at least give readers a heads up to what they are getting into. Yes, I know it's the author's right to organize their work as they see fit, but I did not enjoy my experience and because I don't want a repeat, I won't be continuing the series. The end.

In some cases too fast is a good thing- here it's not. Without much ""meat on the bone"", there isn't much of a story to read.

I couldn't find it locally, so finally ordered one on Amazon.

Now, I LOVE carbonated drinks. I've never bought a Soda Stream though, because there's no place around here to get canister refills, and most of the syrups were disgusting, so no point.  I've been drinking sodas, but want to wean myself off the cola type drinks. I thought this might be a good compromise, as I don't really like plain water.

I bought two brands to try - the other one (not naming it here, since this is a review about LaCroix, but it was strawberry dragonfruit. It was gross, and I love dragonfruit) was NOT good at all, so I almost didn't want to try this one!  That would have been a mistake.
This comes very close to Sierra Mist, IMHO.  Of course, it isn't the same, since there is no sweetener in it. That's right - no sugar, so salt, no fake coloring.  Clear and bubbly.  It was very good.  The colder, the better. I tried it right from the case and it was meh.  But, stuck a few cans in the fridge and let them get nice and cold (I don't always have access to ice), and it improved it a great deal.

I can see this being a regular part of my drink lineup.  It will help me not drink so many sugary sodas, but still give me the carbonation I love.
The light lime taste is nice, and I am a big fan.  You could float lime slices in it if you wanted it more pronounced.

There were also suprising revelations, and numerous twist and turns.  The paranormal angle was unique and I laughted until I literally cried during a couple of scenes involving said ghost.  The book DOES contain one sex scene but IMO it's not overly or particularly graphic.  I found it astounding that one reviewer stated that there ""were too many sex scenes"" and another reviewer implied that the sex scene was gratuitous and extremely graphic.  Both reviews had me wondering what book they read because it couldn't have been this one.  One of the same reviewers then stated that she is not a ""prude.""  However, IMO only the latter could say that this book had ""too many"" sex scenes when there was only one in the entire book.  And anyone who considers that scene overly graphic or gratuitous has most certainly never, most certainly should never and most certainly would never read anything in the erotica/erotic genre.  LOL

Based on some of the reviews, apparently there are some grammatical errors but quite frankly I didn't notice them.  I was too busy enjoy the story.  Yes, some of the characters are a little one dimensional but I still liked them.  Futhermore,  one reviewer stated that Maryse's researching a cure for cancer wasn't feasible well if I not mistaken aren't major companies currently spending millions on research for the same thing.  Come on people lighten up stop over- analyzing and let others enjoy this delightful book.  Sheesh!!

The novel held my attention, but for the first 200 or so pages I could not tell you why, as I did not find it particularly interesting. Once the main event of the book happens the story barrels along to its conclusion, but overall the text is overwritten and massively redundant.
The authors characterization of Frances (the protagonist) is probably the most successful thing about the book, and Sarah Waters does a decent job of creating a sense of time and place. Although 1922 London does not leap off the pages of this text, it is clearly established.
The Paying Guests held my attention for stretches at a time, I guess thats a good thing. However, I suspect that this was partly due to the fact that I wanted to move on and read something else.

9491,"Several weeks elapsed between my viewing of Atlas Shrugged I and this second installment. When the DVD started, and I didn't recognize any of the actors, I stopped the DVD and looked it up on-line to be sure that I had received the correct DVD. I suppose there was a good reason for changing actors for all of the primary roles in the middle of the story, but I can't imagine what it was. It was very disconcerting, to say the least. Once I picked up the story line again, I waited to be swept up into the world of Ayn Rand, but I found the characters to be wooden and the dialogue to be pretentious and awkward. The Rearden and D'anconia actors were okay in their roles, but the new Dagney Taggart lacked the gravitas and presence of the original.

The line ""Who is John Galt"" was heard much more often, but with little explanation or clue as to the answer... The heavy-handed government bureaucrats, seizing the means of production and limiting the output of factories, are universally unlikeable (Rand would like this portrayal.) The special effects, particularly the flying scene, were definitely low budget. Though the film was probably fairly representative of the plot in Rand's book, I don't think the author would have been particularly pleased with this rendition. Nevertheless, I will probably view the third installment when it finally arrives, just to see if the screen writers are able to wrap this up effectively and maintain the integrity of Ayn Rand's dystopian view of society.",1,"[-1.5330453476930714, 1.8060212190165053, -1.8500562687509863, -1.1090428696117351, -2.5229960632853228]",1.8060212190165053

I didn't think it was possible to create such a world in a story that takes place in an average city in an average time. But, she did. Now, there were no dragons in this story, but there was plenty of magic and plenty of the fun and imagination that I really enjoy in Donita's stories.

I was pulled into this story very quickly because I liked Cora right from the start. She is a very nice and likable character. She is a character that I felt an instant connection with and one that I felt deserved happiness - and deserved to go to a magical ball. It also didn't take long for me to like Simon, and of course, his sister Sandy stole the show many times.

I would say the only part of the book that I didn't love was the end. It was the happy ending I was hoping for, but the book just sort of ended and it felt a little flat.

Unfortunately, I did not enjoy Curse the Dawn, and I did not enjoy Midnight's Daughter. Dory is a kick butt Dhampir with family issues. She is not complex, not emotionally deep, and not particularly interesting. To some extent I expect that out of the genre now, but that doesn't mean I like it. I've read deep, realistic, exciting main characters, so I know it's possible. I feel like the author wanted to cram as much action as possible into this book. It's hectic, and it's not just the action, there are also plenty of sub plots and fantasy creatures. Everything was half explained so that the action could continue at it's crazy pace. The main plot is simple, kill Dracula. There are about 20 pages pertaining to just that. Everything else is danger and action. Then there are fey, mutant animals, trolls, and all sorts of other creatures thrown in. Personally, I don't think enough time was spent on anything. If a few of the dangerous encounters were replaced with some plot lengthening this could have been good. I was definitely interested in Dory and Louis-Cesare's pasts, and the animal experiments, as well as the fey and the Dracula family, but there wasn't enough of it.

Justin Halpern's tales of romance and sex don't have the ring of truth to them that so many of his stories in his first book, ""S*@! My Dad Says"", seemed to have. I put the book down wondering just how much of it was made up. I also could not shake my suspicions that Justin is a dope, and I get that this is one of his points. However, I did not feel like he was a dope that you would root for.
The most entertaining and worthwhile parts of the text are the moments where Justin's father takes center stage, and there were far too few of them for me to thoroughly engage in the book. Perhaps this premise has now been stretched too thin for the material that exists and Mr. Halpern needs to try something else. I don't know.
For what it is ""I Suck at Girls"" is an okay read. I was just expecting more. Halpern's observations about romance, love, bad sex, etc. have nothing new or interesting to say, and I guess I was hoping that they would.

But - surprise! - it turns out he really didn't do anything so they were apart all this time, being unfaithful to each other and making no effort to fix their marriage. Aren't the cyborgs supposed to be smart?

I started and stopped reading this several times, then just skipped ahead. I can't really describe why or how it was that I didn't engage with this story. I wanted to as I really enjoyed Seth's character from the other stories in this series, but since I read them for the romance and the adventure, and the romance sucked and the adventure was sterile and slow as well as confusing as how (again) the supposedly superior cyborgs can't seem to get their act together ... well, I didn't enjoy it and was disappointed.",1,"[-1.5711996579137069, 1.7439559446718116, -2.0553505489100607, -1.1159441222431936, -1.796500883432105]",1.7439559446718116

This film is very average and doesn't add anything to the existing plethora of similar films available. It's rating here on amazon is really high. I strongly suggest you watch something more stimulating like Everything Must Go or even the slightly above average Crazy, Stupid, Love which are actually funny. I'd skip this film. Jennifer Aniston should stop doing these kind of roles because she comes across as very attention seeking and daft.

854,"My 11-year-old and 13-year-old granddaughters both recommended this book, and since I expect them to read the books I suggest to them, I always read the books they recommend to me. The cover is outstandingly full of promise for a creepy read, featuring an old-fashioned black and white photo of a little girl apparently levitating. Unfortunately, the book never does deliver.

The expected thrills and chills never really materialize. Sure there's a kind of monster who makes two brief appearances, and we have a chase through a bog, but it's never very exciting or suspenseful. In addition, I felt that the author never really pinpoints one target audience. The central character is a teenager, and a teen romance is included, but otherwise the book reads as if it is written for the tween set, more in line with the Goosebumps series.

This is a book with a gimmick -- the text is interspersed with vintage photos picturing the supposed characters. The photos are truly fascinating, but it often seems that characters are inserted into the plot just because the author happened to find a quirky photo.

Still, my granddaughters liked it so perhaps I am too harsh in my judgments or reviewing the book from too adult a viewpoint. The concept of including the photos is interesting, and, as I said, the cover is dynamite.",1,"[-2.422058561321852, 1.73809076049185, -2.15377034011155, -1.0788700433461333, -2.21718620169396]",1.73809076049185

25,"I've spent hundreds of dollars on various units from Battery Tender, Schumacher, and NOCO.  My first experience was buying a Battery Tender ($49.95) to keep our entry gate properly charged so that it opened and closed when needed. The second one was a Schumacher ($154.00) that I wanted to use to charge and maintain an old 1974 Porsche 914 2.0 Liter.  Unfortunately the clips were too large to fit into the minuscule battery compartment.  However that Schumacher unit worked just fine on charging and maintaining the huge battery in my Ford Lightning.

Then came the NOCO Genius  ($99.95) which I use on another old collector Porsche, a model that would discharge the battery completely while sitting in the garage.  My best guess is that the clock is run by the battery and keeps running until the battery gives up. The NOCO took care of that problem for me as far as maintaining it, but you had to keep an eye on it while charging because our frequent power outages in Southwest Florida keep turning it off.  So for $27.38 I didn't really expect a lot of performance from this Stanley BC209 Battery Maintainer.

However, after receiving this unit, the first time that I needed to charge up a battery was for my Toro Zero Radius lawnmower.  The grass only grows moderately during our three winter months and it is easier on the lawn if you mow it and water it less during this dormant period.  However that usually causes the lawnmower battery to fully discharge.  Hooking it up was simple and the results were perfect.  After that the old Battery Tender in our gate failed and I replaced it with this Stanley unit.  After a month it is functioning perfectly even though it sits in a rusted out control/operator box in our high heat and humidity.

This charger is a great value for the money.  Battery chargers and tenders just keep getting smaller, simpler to use, and more cost effective.

It is not that this movie is not good entertainment as this is a great popcorn fare type of movie with great special effects and beautiful scenery which to me makes the movie.  The biggest issue I have with this movie is the story has basically repeated itself since the first Jurassic Park movie and with the exception of the new special effects hasn't really brought anything new to the series.  With the exception of Pratt, the acting for the most part is fairly mediocre.  Combine that with the weak plotline that is predictable and formulaic to a fault and is essentially a repeat of the previous movies, you get an average popcorn movie.

This book is supposed to serve as an epilogue of sorts to the series with that information. I expected a short book since this isn't a full story. However, this does not even qualify as a book.

This small book is just about 7 inches tall by 5 inches wide.  And each page has one character (or couple) and their ""epilogue,"" or a full page illustration which includes a stylized letter of the alphabet at each section to sort the characters by name. Only the epilogues amount to just a couple of sentences centered on a mostly blank page. In fact, John Quinn on page 138 actually says ""JOHN QUINN had many more adventures."" That's it! AN ENTIRE PAGE FOR ONE SINGLE SENTENCE!!

I am extremely disappointed that Charlaine Harris put her name on this.  If she wanted to give a little peek into the future for fans, this should have been an e-book for 99 cents - or better yet, free on her website. Instead, she let her publisher gouge fans for even more money for something that takes 10 minutes at most to read and probably took about that long to write. What a slap in the face to fans who stuck with her through the end.

9385,"One of the other reviewers compared the movie to a combination of Legally Blonde and Revenge of the Nerds.  That is pretty accurate.  Fans of Anna Faris know that she has very good comedy acting chops (from the scary movie franchise and Waiting).  She is definitely not afraid of saying or doing something totally stupid and ridiculous.  She pulls off the ditzy Playboy Bunny, with a kind heart and smarter than she seems quality very well.  There is definitely not a lot of depth to the character she was trying to play, but what depth there was, she played it well.

The movie has mix of stars who have become A list or B list (mainly Emma Stone and Kat Dennings which the movie did an awesome job of making look plain and downright unattractive respectively before the ""makeover"") with reality tv stars, musicians and lots of cameos from celebrities.  Even though it was not meant to be a movie that was going to win the actors any awards, the fact that at least some of the stars had the ability to act made it as good a movie as it is.  It is definitely not a movie designed to make you think, and it is definitely making fun of the whole fraternity/sorority culture.  It did not try to do too much and pretty much stuck to the comedy that it was meant to be.

This is not a movie that will appeal to everyone.  It is for the most part a mindless comedy that is not meant to, or try to make you think very much.  It had a lot of cute girls in skimpy outfits and/or showing lots of cleavage.  If that is not the kind of movie that entertains you, skip it.

1184,"I have mixed feelings about ""The Sex Lives of Cannibals"" because I alternated between many opinions about this text as I was reading it. It had been on my ""too read"" list for years, and now having read it I am not sure it deserved its spot.
The first 50 pages or so of this book are irritating beyond belief because the author, J. Maarten Troost, has a pedantic and pseudo intellectual vibe going that comes across as the writer being smarmy and cute. It does not endear him to his reader, and that is a problem. However, by chapter seven I was use to his voice and got over my distaste.
""The Sex Lives of Cannibals"" is heavily labeled as a humorous book, and it is funny. More of a smirk and occasional chuckle funny than laugh out loud funny, but Mr. Troost is witty and he employs his wit and sarcasm to nice effect in this travelogue.
I think some of the reviews have been unfair of Troost when they say he is unlikable. Indeed he is at times, especially in the last 25 pages of the book, but his being likable is not a necessary condition for a good read. Some readers have also complained that it was not as anthropological as they had hoped. Mr. Troost is not Tony Horwitz and other writers of that ilk, and to expect him to be is unfair.
I enjoyed this book while reading it (with the exception of the above qualms) but I finished it about four days ago and I am having trouble remembering specifics about the text. I guess that says a lot. I will also note that Mr. Troost's two other books of travel will not jump onto my reading list.

It is not a horror movie. It is a drama based in a near-future world, 2022, and it is certainly not predictable. Well, some things were, but not to the extent that the haters make it sound. This film takes us inside the home of one family during a 12 hour period of terror.

Weird and unusual, the plot is non-traditional and the tension keeps you on the edge of your chair for much of the movie. Acting and stunts were delivered flawlessly. Ethan Hawke doesn't perform in crap movies.

9415,"I loved this movie, and after reading some of the negative reviews, think a lot of people got hung up by watching it as a social commentary. With gay marriage such a hot political topic right now, I guess it's hard not to do that, but I really think it wasn't written to be that way. It's not a soapbox movie. IMHO it's not trying to portray lesbian marriage any certain way, or lesbians themselves, or teenagers, or sperm donors etc. It's about 5 people. 5 individuals, with very distinct personalities, psychological baggage, desires and fears. Two happen to be gay, two happen to be teenagers, and one happens to be a straight male who's never married and once was a sperm donor.

If anything, this film is about marriage and family apart from any of the individuals involved. Or rather, it's about the struggles most of us go through trying to make these things work. The unique back-stories and social milieu are part of the struggle for these particular individuals, but not the point of the story. So I don't think it's fair to judge whether these were 'real lesbians' (who gets to decide what that is anyway?) or 'real teenagers', or whether this presented gay marriage in a positive or negative light.

I think the main reason I loved this movie though is that personally I was just carried along by the characters every step of the way. I believed every single one of them. I thought these 5 individuals put in fabulous performances, and that Annette Benning's was Oscar material. I also laughed out loud at points, so that's great, too.

9335,"A lot of people say this movie was slow and the story line was weak. Most thought the end wasn't as shattering as other movies by Shyamalan. When I saw the trailer of this movie , I thought to myself now thats one movie I wouldn't like to watch.

Twenty minutes into the movie I'm trying to figure out the who's who and the what's what. There are some great scenes in the film that made me want to capture it for a while. I was quite moved by the scene on the porche. Now that was an excellent scene. I felt to myself ""Hell wait a minute...isnt this supposed to be a Horror Flick?"" There's some great emotion that wilfully shows on screen. The elders in the movie and how they were portrayed was as per quite ""unworldly"" owing to the fact it requires complete abandonment of the normal social norms that exist.

I felt I was lost somewhere in the middle of the movie. I mean the total  plot seemed kind of confusing to me. The haunting violins that add to the super stunning visuals only left me more guessing than I thought I would be. Noah's (Adrien Brody) character was very interesting and befitting.

I won't ruin the end for the fortunate people who haven't seen the movie. Fortunate because they have a great movie to look forward to. Once the movie ended , I couldn't help but carry a 10 minute grin on my face. It managed to have that affect on me.

Now I know this movie is not for anyone. Its not your regular scare you to death movie. However its different with its limited yet quite enrapturing.

OMG! I have a new favorite author! This book is amaze balls! I fell in love with the cover at once and the summary sounded really good, but I had no idea how awesome this book was going to be!

I love the world. I love, love, love the characters! The strong women characters are fantastic. Not that it's just about women. I love Zelie's brother Tzain too =)

I love the creatures they ride that are part of their family. I love the world and the magic system. Lets just say I love everything about it!

I recommend this book to anyone that loves fantasy books. READ IT!

the movie itself, just like ellroy's novel, even it was deemed as the best of ellroy's, is so pretentiously noir, noir, overly noir, added some yellowish, brownish lens to imitate that era with chain-smoking people, hats...lousy background music that usually come with disney cartoons, ended this movie up in a messy shape.  not even you've read or re-read the novel first, you still didn't quite get it, no matter what and, couldn't have cared less.

8259,"This book sounded really great, which is one of the reasons I wanted to read it. Unfortunately, the story was bogged down with choppy dialogue, clunky exposition, and too much plot without enough meaning behind it. While I could have gotten over the dialogue and exposition slowing down the pace, it's hard to forgive the side stories that didn't move the story forward. Example: Michelle learns her old teacher is actually her father. Gets upset, has a dinner with him, and you never really hear about it again. Second example: We see a few chapters told from Elron's perspective, but there is literally no reason for it except to show that he is a grief stricken elf with a crush. For two thirds of the book - right in the middle - we don't even hear from him and have no idea what he's doing. Both of these story lines could have been taken out and put into a sequel without damaging the rest of the story. But, honestly, I think most of the world building problems and clunky writing could have been solved or at least minimized by writing in third person. First person forces odd sentence structure without the providing extra information.

I listened to the audio version of this book and I must say the production value was very good. Jeff Hays did an amazing job with the voices. I couldn't believe that he did all the voices, including the females'. The effects were really good, especially the voices over the phone and the magical creature voice effects. The pacing was pretty good, although the comedic timing was a bit off. However, the audio production earned this book an extra star, as I didn't like the writing that much.

There were things I liked about this story. I liked Brick, mostly. And I liked Amelia. I thought they were a good match, and I really liked their chemistry. Their scenes together, their attraction, and the draw they have to one another were realistic and I believed in their relationship and the resolution.

Unfortunately, I was not sold on the parts of the plot that were centered around his daughter. I had a tough time believing in 2 things...the reaction of his family when he found out about the child, and the behavior of his mother at the end. Neither worked for me. At all. It is difficult to discuss this without spoilers, but I didn't think the reactions were authentic. And, I was not able to get past this.

I was annoyed by the behavior of his family at the beginning, and I thought it was over the top. I was annoyed by his behavior at the end, his lack of idea how he wanted to handle the situation was not appealing to me, and the actions of his mother were, again, totally over the top.

It also portrays a young Christian woman willing to follow God's will to help Afghanis. However, I found it very difficult to follow, despite the listing at the beginning, because many characters had up to five names used to refer to them (first name, last name, nick name, rank, and sometimes nationality or culture). It was impossible to learn who was who and the problem could have been easily avoided. Also sometimes the references would come out of nowhere, for example when mention was made of an ""escort"" and later a character spoke. Was that character the escort? A good editing could have taken care of these issues, which kept interrupting the flow and derailed me over and over.

This is a coloring prayer journal that gives you lots of beautiful art to color in and each page is uniquely different. There are amazing prayers throughout as well Scripture to meditate on. I loved writing down what was on my heart as I read the prayers and the Scripture on the lines provided. I like that they give you quite a bit of space to write down your thoughts or prayers.

The pictures to color in are really nice! There are animals, landscapes and more gorgeous things for you to color in. The pages are good quality and handle the colored pencils I used really well. Everything is wonderfully put together and has become a huge favorite of mine.

I highly recommend this beautiful book and think you'll enjoy it as much as I do. I give it 5 out of 5 stars.

That's actually normal for any book released by a noted conservative author. As soon as it comes out, the liberal ""spin machine"" goes into action and denigrates it, hoping that the reading public is too stupid to see the political agenda behind the negativity. Luckily, there is still a large segment of American society that likes to make up its own mind, and doesn't need the poohbahs at [...] and such to tell it what is good to read, and what is not. Left up to themselves, these upholders of ""liberal"" values would stage mass book-burnings, as we saw in the '30s and '40s in Europe. Sure, Ann may not have opinions that meet everyone's notion of actuality, but she has just as much right to publish them as Chris Matthews has the right to call the Bush administration ""criminal"". I don't see conservatives howling for Matthews' removal from television, as those paragons of righteousness did for Bill O'Reilly's removal for a statement clearly taken out of context. And what about the General Betray us ad? It's venal and patently untrue, but where was the big outcry by the ""freedom of speech"" crowd against it? A strange silence. People like Ann are necessary to counteract the ""vast left wing conspiracy"" (sorry, Hillary), and to give other points of view.

5863,"This was a quick, light read.  I really enjoyed the story.  It is told from the viewpoint of a man, which I really liked because it isn't very common for a romance novel.  Nick, the main character is the perfect guy that any girl would love to have.  He is kind, honest, and sincere.  He wants to have a fairytale marriage where he and his wife love each other unconditionally for the rest of their lives.

It quickly becomes obvious that Nick's fiancee does not share his dedication and commitment, but Nick is stubborn and refuses to give up on his marriage before it even starts.  The plot was predictable, but it contained enough humor and character development to keep me interested.  There were a few places where the dialogue got a little long, and I wish there had been something to break it up a bit.

There were quite a few editing errors, and I am a huge stickler on those kinds of things.  Typos, words that were left out completely, using a character's name before they are introduced - the kinds of mistakes that should have been fixed.  There was a final edit done in between the time I read it and when it was released, so I imagine that most of those have been caught.

Other than my hang up about the typos, I really liked this book.  It was a very clean romance, and I love not having to worry about something questionable popping up in a book.  I would gladly recommend this book to anyone that enjoys light, clean romance novels.

Also for some reason there were two topless women with large breasts in the movie who didn't do anything other than just have large breasts and show them off.  But then again I guess it's to draw guys in because Hollywood thinks that's all men want to watch.

Moving on, it's not a bad movie.  It takes the movies you loved a few years back and puts them all into the Hunger Games and lets them kill one another off.

It is a typical Pepper Winters book - unusual, dark, strangely compelling, and did I say unusual?  Her stories ARE unusual.  This one really wasn't as bad as I was led to believe.  I enjoyed the strangeness and twists (hate cliffhangers, tho, but if you have to have one, this was a lulu!!).  If you like Pepper Winters, this book will NOT surprise you with its content.  You will still like it even if it is unusual.

The hero WAS awful but I can't figure out how the other reviewers missed his slight little bit of humanity that poked out just a wee bit. THAT is what gave this book a good taste in my mouth - the hope that maybe he can redeem himself in another book.  If not, then you're gonna hate him (which is the point - he's an anti-hero - or maybe an anti-villain?).  The heroine (in my opinion only) was pretty stupid at first.  I hope she can find a brave place because I suspect the next book is only going to be darker.

I don't think it is fair for someone to give a bad review and low star count because the book is exactly what the author writes - dark with twists.  You have enough spoilers in the other reviews so why did you buy it then give it a bad review because it was what they said it was?

With years and the avalanche of crop of young authors of romance putting their stamp and feet forth, Johanna's stories kept coming, but to me they were now a bit `behind' the times. Does that make any sense? I'm not saying that they were bad or even mediocre. They were good. I'm still buying them. It's just that they're missing something and I can't put my finger on it. I want to say `passion' and `chemistry' however I'm not sure if that's IT or maybe something else. Whatever IT is, it's missing from her recent releases.

The word out there, throughout the `internets' is that she's not writing them and that she's employing a `ghost writer'. I'm not buying it. Or I should say, I don't want to buy it.

It has your prerequisite 'strong, independent' heroine, who actually is anything but, as well as the typical testosterone fueled steroid case 'hero'...the growling, glowering, 'take charge' fellow who will aggravate, titillate, and quicker than quick seduce the idiotic heroine.  Yippee...

If you want to read about base sexual attraction, sexual ponderings, and sexual encounters without having an inconvenient plot line to deal with, then this is the book for you.

Together, along with the rest of the Kingsmen. they must stop the global threat Valentine (Jackson) has set up. Before I really looked at the rating for this I was expecting a teenage Cody Banks type movie. After seeing it was rated R I was confused. The movie is very much geared toward the teenage crowd, but the fact that there are over 100 uses of the f-word take it out of the teenage crowd acceptability. The fact that the movie is about a younger agent takes this out of the older crowd's desire to see this. Colin Firth is very good and this is a different part for him. The main problem is that the swearing and violence push it out watch-ability for the crowd it is intended for. Had the movie been the same without the swearing it would have found an audience. As it stands its in between those that can't see it and those that don't want to. Overall, adding the unnecessary swearing really hurt the movie badly.

It left me feeling confused, and rather empty, hollow. It didn't quite fulfill my expectations of good story telling and the romance wasn't as passionate as it was applied in the books blurb.

I expected to see a big cast and a big budget movie, but that was not to be.  The acting was fine and the story interesting, but knowing the intention is to present the story in three parts can only hurt it's box office.  Hollywood wants to get all it can get out of you and this trilogy idea appeals more to the soap opera fans than those that wants to just enjoy a film with a beginning and end.  Remembering that the story was written in 1957 this futuristic novel taking place in 2016 was pretty close.  Government has run amok and the idea of making every one equal (whether they are talented or not) and every business equal (whether their work is good or bad) has become the rule of the land.  Success is being crushed by politicians in a spread the wealth idea and Political Correctness is dragging down the country with a socialistic/communistic slant.  Suddenly the best and the brightest are starting to disappear and no one knows where they are going, but as they vanish those left are having a difficult time handling the oppressive and hard problems that are arising.

Several books on him could be written which would provide better detail an explanations of events and the people around him. It feels like at times that it is Napoleon with some friends that we've never met before.

The author obviously knows his subject matter well and has a good grasp of the military exploits of Napoleon. The problem is that the reader does not. Generals are mentioned with no context. By the end of the book I still knew nothing about any of them. Town names are used all over the place that mean nothing to the reader. It becomes boring and confusing.

It took me several pages to get into this novel, then it seemed to move very slowly and the ""flow"" of the story, at times, seemed disconnected. The plot dragged quite a bit as well.  I feel it would have been more appealing if the storyline would not have dwelt on the complexities for so long.
There were a good variety of personalities in the authors characterizations. They were well-defined.  The background scenes were fairly well described.
The last half of the story was much better than the first half.
There was profanity and a lot of crude language and expressions. There was also sexual references and a couple of explicit sex scenes. What could have been a beautiful love story was diminished by the language and crudeness.
The Title and book cover depicts the story quite well although does nothing to attract  the reader's attention.

It has flaws-- I felt the amount of sex that the author described was unnecessary-- but it is so entertaining, one forgives these faults.

7022,"OK, so heres my view from 30,000 feet. And by that Im referring to not only book 1, which I just finished, but also books 2-4, which, I admit, I read only the fly leafs. But, based on those, I do not plan to read any more of this writer.
To begin with, it appears that I am one of the very few reviewers that failed to drink the kool aide after reading book one. Because otherwise, how else to explain why books 1-4 got so many 5 star reviews?
I do not retell story lines in my reviews. What I do is analyze plot, character development, rising and falling action, anti climax, and resolution. I feel that honest comment on those attributes better serves  summarizing the read.
Frankly, the plot was okay. I analyze plot by how well I can recall where I left off with the story line when I return to it after a period of time. Good plot is one that means I did not have to re read passages in order to continue on with the read. I was able to do that with this book.
There was very little depth to the character development of the antagonist. We knew the identity, but really little else motivating why the attack on the victim. I thought the hostile relationship between the antagonist and lead protagonist needed to be better explained.  And, why that victim, or, why that level of  hostility toward that victim? Because of the special relationship between the protagonist and the victim?? Please.
Character development of the lead protagonist was better, but not so much with the protagonists side kick, or colleagues.
Rising action was okay. There was continuum throughout as to that. Falling action collided with anti climax of which the latter was a dud in my view. Resolution was maudlin. Likely a set up for future stories.
Its stated that book one, although part of a series, is a stand alone read. That comment was the saving grace for me.
I have read books only to come to the end whereupon to be continued is thrown out (tongue in cheek no doubt). Writers that do that get a special rating  for that tactic.
Bottom line, this book was just okay, a 3 rating. But as said, Im done with this series, because I suspect there is more of the same going forward, i.e., same story just different characters.",1,"[-2.2906764641460047, 1.4236883371951325, -2.148524190787222, -1.0653870015456566, -2.235165805143332]",1.4236883371951325

I had to DNF at 58% because I was wondering, what now? They said their I-love-yous and even their good-byes, so what's next? And was I even curious to find out?

The answer seems to be no.

A book friend told me I'd love the chick. Mehhhh, not really. She's an odd one but not because of being an ex-thief or her secret, but that's how she comes off. She often says pointless things, randomly spits them out and I'm scratching my head, wondering how that was relevant to the story, in any way?

And let's not get into how unlike-able the hero is. He's actually repulsive and if I had to share a house with him, I'd clobber him with the frying pan, daily. Because yes, the a-hole jerk deserves no less.

But anyway, I felt zero connection to the characters, the story. I'm confused as to what's it about. The heroine's secret? The hero's secret? An important Southern family's secret? Again, I'm pondering on how some things are relevant to the story because I just don't get it. It's the first time I've read a book by this author, I have no idea how her other stories are, but this one didn't sell me on wanting to read them.

4348,"I didn't get along with the oddly constructed book. I say oddly constructed because it starts with an apparent execution but the next chapter the apparent victim carries on as if nothing happened. The key is that the chapters aren't time sequenced so the second chapter takes place before the first but no indication of that exists in the text. Instead one must reason it out. The execution scene picks up again at about the 80% point which does resolve several threads left loose from the get go.

Thats not the only disconnect I had here. There were many references and simple word usages which baffled me. Likely a good deal of my being lost was due to the book being placed in the context and word usage of the UK, however the references to the music and other pop culture figures which likely add dimension to this book for some, left me utterly at sea. Id say I didn't get a single music reference in the first part of the book. The second part improved my score to maybe 50% but I still was made to feel like an ignoramus by the author.

The book takes place in Ulster, Ireland where nobody exists without being labeled by his or her religion and judged by same. So everybodys a Prod or Finian and either hated or accepted based in the observers hatred or love for one superstition or the other. This is a perfect example of people killing each other over who has the better imaginary friend.

I grew so tired of the religious hatred, constant labeling of everybody based on their religion that the book became a weary slog for me. I didn't care for any of the characters finding the good or bad guys good or bad factions depended on the particular power balance at any given time. The IRA does disgusting acts as do the Loyalists if they get a chance.

The bad guy becomes obvious at about the 50% mark but by that time in the book, the persistent hatreds and annoying references to obscure figures of pop culture had worn me down to the point where I didn't care. The final act does contain a good deal of action unlike the balance of the book but that, while well done, couldn't save it for me. My wife wishes to tour Ireland.

I chose the brown color. The wallet is  made from very thin material and , yes, there is a crinkling sound when the wallet is opened and closed or the bill separator flap is moved. I don't see this to be an issue and just people nit-picking. I've only had the wallet a day or so and it is holding my stuff firmly in place and I don't see anything that would indicate the wallet is fraying or coming apart..., yet.
Now, this wallet is definitely overpriced by about $10-$12 dollars in my estimation. It does feel cheap and I guess the RFID blocking works. I have no easy way to check. I did receive an email asking me to give the wallet a 5 star review for reasons I find unworthy and objectionable.
This is not a 5 star wallet if all factors are considered. I 've had expensive wallets from Italy and this is not in the same class. My review is taking into consideration the price, workmanship and what it is supposed to accomplish with RFID blocking.
In conclusion, the material is thin and the wallet feels cheap and the price is high. On the other hand, I think t was the best pick from the Amazon RFID wallets. I don't expect this wallet to last more than one year at the high end.
If I could get an Italian RFID wallet, I would not resort to such an inferior looking wallet but right now the RFID made my sale.",0,"[1.3953059735611393, 1.3273698763175652, -1.7907611725360737, -1.0944095404227259, -2.084529236903086]",1.3953059735611393

I did jump to the end to see who was responsible for trying to kidnap Katie.  I thought I deserved that for suffering through more than half of this book

I must say the author did a good job of withholding who wanted Katie kidnapped.

I was really disappointed because idea for the plot was great and it made me very sad for it to go no where.

The characters were not well developed at all.
The story seemed to jerk the reader around just as Jason jerked Katie around.
Jason kept promising answers, which might have helped the reader out, as well as Katie; but as far as I read they were never given
The monologues were repetitive and the story drug on enough without having to reread it before we even got to the end.

I didn't like Jason or Katie and everyone else was pretty much an honorable mention.

1859,"While browsing in my bookstore, I came up with this book in my hands. In the back cover, the text was the same as one of the editorial reviews stated in this page, the one that ends with: ""... and his name is Jesus Christ"".
So I thought: relics theft, worldwide plague, human cloning, and Jesus Christ all in the same story. These are elements that could make a book great. I Bought it.
After reaching the end of the book, I was very disappointed. The back cover text is not true at all. ""Year zero"" is not an adventure nor a thriller, but more like a philosophical text about a world that was devastated by an ancient plague and the effort by those who were spared to quickly find a cure. Although Long's writing style is not bad, his plot and his characters are dull and boring. After the first 100 pages, which are indeed very interesting and set a premise that could be much more well developed, it's all downhill.
There are many books dealing on apocalypse-like and dead-end-for-humanity situations and many of them are better than ""Year zero"": ""The stand"", ""On the beach"" are just two of them.
If the editors had not wanted to create an adventure-like atmosphere to this book, maybe I would have set my mind on a different frame-reading, and then I could have enjoyed it much more. As it is, I didn't.

Seriously mundane stuff.
I've read Dee in the past but hadn't picked up any of her work in years, this is probably why. When I lose interest in an author I should probably just stay away.
I wanted to love this story, but so much of it was the two main characters talking about her millions of dollars to give away, or the coins that she had to sell.

There was some romance and mystery thrown in there, though it was easy to figure out the connections. The ""who done it"" wasn't as easy to figure out, mainly because you don't read about him until he's a suspect.

1613,"I was torn between 3 and 4 stars.  Yes, the book has some flaws, but I enjoyed it more than most ""urban fantasy.""  I should perhaps admit that I do not read vampire books -- the whole vampire thing leaves me cold.  I agree with the comments made by other reviewers:  Eugenie seems to run around without planning ahead or thinking things through.  She is astonished to discover that turning her kingdom from a temperate climate into a desert has caused hardship to its inhabitants.  Hel-lo!

I had a problem throughout with the author's use of time.  Why does everything happen in a day?  Time should elapse more normally; for example, weeks, if not months, should have elapsed between the end of the prior book and the beginning of this one; when Eugenie brings textbooks to the Otherworld, a month or so should elapse before innovations begin to built.

 I could do without the long sex scenes (mostly they make me laugh), but I know that  a lot of people like them.  I actually prefer the ""foreplay"" scenes, such as the  quasi-romantic scenes with Dorian.

On the plus side, like other reviewers, I enjoyed the cast.  Eugenie is sometimes childish, but she is young, and I think part of the story is her learning and making choices (not all of which will be right).  I don't understand why so many readers hate Kiyo.  I don't find it at all off-putting that he is excited over the birth of his child and concerned for Maiwenn; I would despise him if he didn't care.  Eugenie is acting like a child when she complains about it.  And he is not to be despised for being peaceful, and worrying that she will be corrupted by power.  It just comes down to the kind of life one wants.

The world-building was also good as far as it goes (maybe a bit derivative of Amber) but it could use elaboration.  Its rules are not clear.

In sum, it's pretty good, and I hope there is another in the works; Thorn Queen is a whole  year old.",1,"[-2.029495370507567, 1.3759894802657424, -1.9451639218947112, -1.0443312973445287, -2.6809257037754315]",1.3759894802657424

1996,"This was a fairly good novel but I found the author's style to be a bit trying.  Chapters alternated between Claire and The Hermit.  Nothing wrong with that.  However, within a chapter the author jumped all over the place.  A paragraph about the Hermit jumps to a paragraph about Ted Kennedy, followed by a paragraph about what the Hermit thinks, followed by a paragraph about Chappaquiddick, and then a paragraph about the Hermit.  This style appears in many of the chapters and, quite frankly, it detracts from the story. Another detraction was the detailed culinary play-by-play.  It was a novel and not a cookbook so the over-the-top descriptions were irritating since each meal was wrought with details that were so unnecessary.
The character development was quite good and that is a postive element.  Claire and the Hermit are very believeable characters as they deal with their personal issues and find a way to trust one another.",1,"[-3.6690995483995787, 1.3590756786626446, -1.840426151132825, -1.088297194050958, -2.2883186143758305]",1.3590756786626446

6073,"The stories weren't as good as I anticipated.  The characters were complex and the action was great, but the romance was iffy.  I thought the two stories in one meant two separate stories . . . one story for the first half of the book than the another story for the second part of the book.  I did not realize the stories were intermingled which caused some confusion on my part.  I kept getting the characters and their past mixed up as the plot switched between stories.  I preferred Rory and Liberty's story.  It had more romantic possessiveness and Rory was very patient and loving with Liberty overcoming her past.  Conall and Rhea's story was just okay.  You didn't get the same doting on each other like Rory and Liberty.  I guess because Conall is an Alpha and Rhea is a warrior so their love wasn't as soft.  The stories centered on Bo and Nyx's wedding and a rogue wolf trying to take over Finn's territory.  So there were lots of action and revenge.",1,"[-2.57907690617515, 1.3539205790307651, -1.834657038499047, -1.1036191142364042, -2.2209609529226815]",1.3539205790307651

Lauren Layne is my number one author. She is my go to girl when I need to read a good book. You know, when you are in a rut and want a GOOD book??? Lauren is it for me. She is my spirit animal. My soulmate. My fav. She is it for me.

Someone Like You had me giddy and wiggling all around when I read it. When I was reading the book, Adele was playing in my head. I was signing her version of ""Someone Like You"" and thinking, this book is as good as the song!

I feel in love with Lincoln the second the book started. Swoon!! He is my everything wrapped in one. He is sensitive and sweet and handsome and sarcastic all rolled into one !

Then there is Daisy. I can't not think of one bad thing to say. She was awesome in her own rite. When you put them together, you have something special. Alone, they are good, together they are better. See, each of them has their own past (but don't we all) and when they become friends, they complete each other. Friends turned lovers is one of my favorite type of reads. So this one was a win for me!!

This book really centers around Chloe and Gavin. They are childhood best friends, that love each other. But because of different circumstances and people. They never really act on their feelings. Through out this book you will see these two fight what they feel and be afraid to show them,  These two story like any good book will leave you frustrated.

You, as the reader, will also find your normal life put on hold, as you won't be able to put this book down. With Velocity, Koontz returns to the top echelon of thriller writers. Velocity provides not only a fast-paced, nail-biting, suspenseful storyline, it contains characters that are very well-developed and multi-dimensional. The main character, Billy Wiles, who on the surface seems like an ordinary, hardworking guy, is one that you'll remember for a long time. I've enjoyed many of Koontz's books over the years and Velocity ranks very near the top -- second only to Watchers, Intensity and Dark Rivers Of The Heart. Velocity is definitely worth reading but --beacause of its slightly disappointing ending -- is not worthy of a 5-star rating.

I've never been so turned off by a character in book before I was taken kind of by surprise. The male character, Tristan was mysterious and alpha but he seemed a little too aloof for me and in the beginning ran hot and cold from one sentence to the next. My other complaint would be that in the beginning the story progressed so rapidly that I couldn't wrap my mind around it. Literally he said a handful of words to her and the next thing you know she's straddling him in his living room and they are having sex. Huh?!? Then the next day he moves all her stuff into his home. Now your probably wondering why I still gave it 4 stars but it really started to get good right towards the end. Nina started to take the whine down a few notches and Tristan stopped acting like he has some type of split personality disorder. The suspense made me start to want and turn the page a little faster to discover what happens. The ending wasn't a huge cliffhanger but it does leave you wanting to find out how everything is going to come together in the end. So I suppose in some ways it redeemed itself but if you could give 1/2 stars I'd probably rate it at 3 1/2 to be fair.

If you want the light to be less bright, you have the option of using one of the lights - two for a brighter light.

I use these lights for one purpose - to have a night light with which to read my Kindle keyboard and yes, they do get a lot of use so perhaps I have used them beyond what their feature promised relative to ""never burning out.""

There is so much about this novel that impressed me and that struck me as completely unlike anything I'd ever read before.  TGitR isn't a perfect novel, but it's a lot more diamond than rough than many of the reviews on this page suggest.  Here's my advice: read the first few chapters and see whether you're hooked.  If you're not, take a pass.  It's not that the first few chapters are at all predictive of the many fascinating turns this novel goes on to take, but the odds that you -- like me -- will find those turns ""fascinating"" at all is, I'd venture, a function of how immersed you find yourself in the ideas and the feel of this novel early on.

It was more of being told that he was so horrible rather than actually feeling that danger which kept me a bit apart from the story and made it difficult to identify with Tess's plight.

I'm a very character and romance driven reader. You can have a slower book and I'll still be completely satisfied as long as the characters are strong and the romance is there. Unfortunately it just wasn't there for me. It seemed to be another case of needing to show rather than tell just like the threat from the big bag. I just want feeling the attraction or connection between them at all. It just felt forced despite taking most the book for any forward momentum.

Overall this was just a mediocre read for me. Considering how much I love this series and look forward to each new installment, I really feel let down. I realize I've said that several times throughout this review but there's no better way to explain my feelings about this book.

I think I had come to many of the basic ideas of the book and was starting to see the blessings in hardship and brokenness but this book helped me focus on many aspects I had not been.

The book is dense, and does not seem to have a real linear narrative.  The chapters did not seem to lead to the next, so it read more like a daily devotional.  Each chapter did have a theme but the chapters seemed loosely organized. This is not a criticism but it is noticeable.  The pages were dense with thought invoking text and I found that I often stopped for reflection and re-read sections.

If there was anything I didn't like about the book, it is that it sometimes was female oriented, but not consistently.  But being a man reading the book, there were times that the message was addressed to women. But, it didn't take too much flexibility to get past that :)

404,"This was book 3 by Diana Gabaldon in the Outlander series, and I am a HUGE fan. I loved Books 1 & 2 and the tv series which wraps up right around that time, but my god, Book 3 was WAY way too much fast-moving PLOT that reeked of sea adventures, island rituals, bizarre characters, and some not-so-well-explained voodoo magic. YIKES! The dynamic between Claire and Jamie was neither explored further nor really had time to develop because Diana threw SO MANY fast-moving events in our direction. Way too much plot, way too little story.

I started losing interest after the boy gets captured. I won't give it away for those who haven't read it but those who have, you know what I'm talking about. The nature of the events seemed to be so made up, so incongruent to the overall story, and awfully put together that it made me think she was just stringing us along. I listened to the audio version and actually put it on 1.25x to make it move along faster. I also switched to reading on the Kindle here and there. The islands didn't do anything for me and honestly, the characters surrounding this event seemed as dull and uninteresting as it could get.

Gosh I'm just going to wrap it up by saying this was a most unsatisfying story, yet it included two of my favorite characters who manage to grow way less favorite to me. Is it possible to get seasick from reading a book and going through the motions of the storm with your characters? Well, I think I did.

Now I have to decide if I'm going to continue the story. Feeling let down and sad that I no longer can say I LOVE love love Outlander.

Kilmartyn is rich, handsome, has dark green eyes and a slutty wife.  Bryony has never appeared in public because she has a few pock marks on one side of her face.  She suspects Kilmartyn of causing the ruination and death of her father and the destitution of her and her two sisters so she becomes his housekeeper to seek out the TRUTH.  Okay, I'm riding the wave to this point.

Then.  Right off the bat, she comes on to him!  What?!  You think he may be guilty of your father's death and the cause of all your misfortunes, and you get all swoony with him?  Are you crazy, Bryony?

Well, at this point I didn't like either one of them.  And it just got worse, really worse. ~sigh~

The plot - uh, where *was* the plot? wandered in and out of focus...mostly out.  The characters:  This is the first bubble-headed hero (?) I've come across.  And despicable.  Believe me, he's nothing but a pretty face.  The heroine (?) - TSTL.

I may only borrow one book per month and I chose this one, so I *truly* wanted to like it.  Just couldn't, though.  Unlikable characters, with a poorly constructed story.  Disappointing and unpleasant experience.

This is the first I've read by Ms. Stuart and it could just be one of those horrible flukes.  After all, not every novel written by even the most brilliant author can be equally brilliant.  If any Anne Stuart fans read this, I will appreciate their guidance to another Stuart novel.  I'm certainly willing to jump back into the swim.

In the meantime she has let Jean Claude ""marry"" the marks (this was done on stage at the vampire club and had everyone all hot and bothered...except for the reader who was appalled). After the marks ""marry"", she starts having sex with everyone in sight and it's one sex scene after another. While she is doing all this, the wereleopard is still waiting to be rescued. 2 books back the storyline was pretty much like this, but the last book was good, but that is because Anita was in New Mexico helping out Edward.

584,"In reading the reviews of _the Bluest Eye_, I am struck by the variety of opinon and reactions to the story.  I am of mixed opinions.  I thought Morrison's characters were brilliantly conceived- their perspectives and attitudes were believable, their interactions and motivations understandable given their natures.  While many of the characters were unsympathetic - monsterous, even - that Morrison was able to evoke such a strong reaction from me given these people is one of the hallmarks of a master storyteller.

The tragedy of the story - its brutality, its unfairness, and the way in which the characters react and handle the ugliness and injustice was unsettling.  I certainly understand why reviewers objected to the way Morrison wrote this.  However, the world is often ugly and unjust; bad things happen to innocents, people are cruel and sometimes the bad guys get away with committing horrible deeds.  As I understand the story, this is a large part of what Morrison is showing readers.

Yet I can't rate the book very highly - not because of the monsterous deeds or the injustice, but because of its organization and conclusion.  The change in perspectives and backstories of characters made for choppy reading, which I didn't care for.  Thankfully the afterword explained why Morrison chose to do this, and with hindsight it makes perfect sense - I would have rather had this as a foreward, the better to clue readers in about what to expect.  Similarly I was not pleased with the conclusion.  While I did not expect a happy ending (the story is, ultimately a tragedy), I had expected more attention to society's expectations of what beauty is and how this impacts and is interpreted within the African-American community rather than the anti-climactic ending Morrison has here.  Morrison has a tremendous eye for detail and is a brilliant writer, but I much prefer her essays to her novels.",1,"[-1.2317132443276415, 1.3082129269220384, -2.217065033528232, -1.0751764466069205, -1.9967532340450305]",1.3082129269220384

I think the author held back to many secrets for surprise value; it only got me more irritated the longer I read.

The structure is good, but the black moment wasn't really that black nor was it really the main characters - it was her friend who had the worst news.

And I have to admit to being supremely irritated with both main characters - each of the main characteristics: hes beyond obnoxiously bossy and always gets what he wants which means hes freaking entitled (hate that) and shes sexually obsessed with him and cant stop thinking about him. Ugh. Constantly. Every single time her voice narrates its always about him. I cant say either character is particularly and especially likable. They just are.

981,"The first time I experienced this book, it was the audio version performed by the author. I loved it, so I bought it, and read it through a second time. Although oftentimes when I discuss a book with friends I come to like it a little bit less or more, in the case of this book, that was not the case. My friend pointed out that she does some unethical things (and she does) but that didn't sway me. Instead, I appreciated the fact that she has become such a successful person in spite of the fact that like all of us, she IS flawed and she is not afraid to share that fact. I loved that readers learn that she suffers from a mental illness (this isn't a spoiler, the book is ranked #1 in bipolar disorder). I love that she has such a great relationship with her lab partner, Bill. And I love that she provides tons of interesting information about plants. In fact, there is very little that I don't love about this book. The one thing that I wonder, even after experiencing it two times, is that she keeps details of her upbringing somewhat private and alludes to not having been shown a lot of love; however, that didn't change the fact that I loved the book.

In summary, I can't imagine anyone who is the slightest interested in STEM subjects who wouldn't enjoy reading this book.

The removable egg attachment is too floppy, which drops a star.  The whole unit gets very hot and takes quite a while to cool down.  A floppy middle section can be dangerous.

Close the lid and lift by the back foot and hinge where it's not hot.  Easy to move.  Very easy to remove the middle section and toss in soapy water to soak.

This is the same stuff I get on a smaller scale for use in the kitchen (baking, putting in the water for boiling bagels and pretzels, etc.) and deodorizing the refrigerator.  But I wanted a huge package (I got the 64 ounce box) because I needed it to neutralize the acid etchant solution I was using for copper and, being new at this craft, I wasn't sure how much I would need.

This is more than enough to last me a long time, as it turns out.  Do proceed with any kind of acid neutralization slowly, as you will get carbon dioxide production (i.e., bubbles) and you don't want to overflow your container.  If you are making bath salts or similar, this is a more economical choice than the smaller packages.  This was free flowing and non-clumpy in the package.  (64 ounces is not practical for everyday baking, you'd want a smaller container than that unless you run a commercial bakery...)

One thing I like is that this isn't hygroscopic -- it doesn't pick up water from the environment if left open.  Which is good because it's in a big cardboard box and isn't really recloseable (is that a word?).  So it will be good pretty much indefinitely (as long as the box is not sitting directly in water).  Even those little bugs that get into pasta and grains in the pantry don't invade this stuff.

The writing reminded me of the better National Lampoon stories of the 1970s (the ANIMAL HOUSE golden days of obnoxious humor).  Rude, crude, hilarious.

Even though Tucker Max is a sexist, drunken player, I also found it hard to feel sorry for his ""victims.""  In fact, I couldn't see most of his women as ""victims"" at all.  There wasn't much deception or manipulation on his part; there just appears to be a lot of drunken, easy women out there who fall for anything.

The stories have that unmistakable authenticity of having really happened, no matter how ridiculous or outrageous they become.  Just the title chapters alone were making me laugh out loud.

If there's anything sad about this very funny book, it has little to do with Tucker Max.  He's hilarious, honest and talented.

It seemed to have a lot going on and I found it to be very interesting.  I think where the author started to lose me was when I really couldn't figure out what the main premise of the book was.  She does a good job of carrying the story along, but I think it lacks focus.  It is classified on Amazon as romance yet my Kindle said that I was 80% finished with the book and I still wasn't sure who she was even most interested in of the many male character possibilities in the story.  When I was partway through I decided that this book wasn't so much about romance, but rather her trying to find her mother who had left them abruptly.  Yet, that story line seemed to fizzle out and was really only mentioned briefly at the end.  I just don't know.  She is a good writer.  I'd give her books a try again.

What an amazing, heart wrenching, jaw dropping book this was.  Now, I loved Jackson, but holy hot dayuum Liam just stole my heart and RAN!  This book, the feelings, the emotions Just Wow! The minute you pick up Consolation, her writing just sucks you in and you won't put this one down until you reach the end.  Even then, youll keep swiping your kindle like a maniac because you will want more!

Natalie is grieving the loss of her husband.  The day that knock came to the door, was the day her life was changed forever.  Raising a beautiful baby girl on her own Aarabelle, Natalie pushes through to get through her daily routine.  She is hurt, lost and just feels abandoned by her late husband.  He promised he would come back, but promises aren't always kept.  Like any good mother, she picks herself up and gets through the day but is she really living?

My life is gone.  My heart is dead.  Im a widow at twenty-seven - Natalie

Insert Liam Dempsey into the picture.  Holy mother of gawd this man is just pure perfection.  He is gorgeous, honest, sweet and so caring.  He is a current SEAL and was Aarons best friend.  He steps in and helps Natalie even though she doesnt think she needs any help in things that need to be taken care of once you lose someone.  But, he offers so much more.  You cant help who you fall in love with, even if it seems forbidden and wrong, the heart wants what it wants.

I shouldnt want this but I do.  I shouldnt be comfortable in his arms.  But I am.  I should make him leave and put some distance between us.  But I cant.  - Natalie

This was an exceptionally written story.  You will laugh, you will cry, you WILL SCREAM at your kindle.  These are all guarantees while you read.

2613,"I am giving this book 3.5 stars. I can't give it 4 but I feel like it deserves more than 3.

I finished this book days ago and I still don't know how to write this review. I have never read E.K. Blair before, but I will be checking out some of her other books, she is a phenomenal writer. As for the story I am torn, I've been aggravated by it and I can't figure out why. Why did Anonymous need her story told? Why didn't she just write it, as fiction. Why is the ending the way it is? On some very out of this world level I can almost, ALMOST relate to her story, where it started. It's hard being a mom and wife, we lose ourselves very easily. So when we get ANY kind of positive attention towards us, the woman we have long forgotten it feels nice, amazing even. But then you remember who you are, what you have, and how hard you worked to get there. From the story there wasn't anything really in her life that should have made her so unhappy to go as far as she did. I am not judging her, I am not mad at her nor do I hate her. I am just not understanding how she went that far with everything she had. There were parts of the story that made no sense to me, parts I didn't quite understand why they were there. I had a slew of different emotions while reading, E.K. Blair did an amazing job pulling me in, connecting me to the story, and making me feel things. Things I didn't want to feel sometimes. As far Anonymous' best friend in the story, I am shocked, I can sort of see why she would be there and support her but at the same time I think to myself I could never ever watch my best friend self destruct, live that way, and not try my damndest to get her help. Make her understand. Do something, anything besides be there. As far as the ending goes I am baffled. Why did the story just stop? Is she still living in limbo? What's the point in telling a story and not give an ending?",1,"[-1.4690318600874817, 1.2525263907257802, -2.295844927741955, -1.1146487862326029, -1.6109677835453868]",1.2525263907257802

This Train Station story was being offered at a bargain price so I thought to give Bush books another shot. Well, now I know.  Holly Bush and I aren't a good fit.  It seems that OLIVE was the only exception.

This book has good bones.  The story, unfortunately underdeveloped, could have been excellent, perhaps if written with a lighter touch and a tad more care and talent.  Instead almost everyone here was an exaggerated caricature and the story was predictable and exasperating.  For example, how unkind and mean-spirited can one family be?  Based on the Crawford family here, the answer is limitless unkindness and meanness.  And how stupid and spineless can one heroine be?  Based on Julia here, the answer is limitless spinelessness and stupidity.

The hero was 90% OK except for his one big moment of failure.  The mistaken identity and subsequent wrong couples paired at the beginning was not used to any advantage, the city girl acclimating to country life was underdeveloped, and, frankly speaking, I didn't like anyone in the Crawford family, including the heroine.  The hero deserved someone with more sense and more spine.

A large part of the book deals with the heroine reconnecting with her community and old friends and relatives. That might put it more into the women's fiction category than mystery.

Thirteen years before the story starts, Holly left her small hometown when her nine-year-old sister disappeared. Her boyfriend was suspected of the crime but never charged. When she comes home to care for her dying mother, he returns, too. She's still sure he's a killer, but she's the only one in town who thinks so.

Then another young girl, a daughter of a good friend, disappears.

The plot is good, although I suspected pretty quickly what had happened. The problem lay in the suspense--the focus kept changing--and the characters. There were too many actions and attitudes of the characters that didn't read true, almost as if the author shaped them as necessary to fit her plot.

I really was struggling with this book. The first chapter was a little bit slow, but it was getting better later. Then there were new characters being introduced which was the reason why I was struggling. I like Dual POVs but I never like multiple POVs. I can count on one hand the multiple POVs books that I enjoyed.

Considering that the previous book ended with a cliffhanger so I was really eager to know what would happen to the three main characters. So, introducing Manon in this book was a wrong move. As least if she crossed with any of the three MC, I might feel some connection with the character, but no. Never once. It was like a different story altogether. While everyone's parts were put me to the edge. Inserting some new character and didn't make it interesting enough was a mistake. I'd tried so hard to read her chapters until I couldn't take it anymore so I started skimming the rest of her parts.

However, I admit that adding Sorcha was a welcome. That was what I thought until I reached the end. Why!? Why did you do that to Dorian!? Poor Dorian. Someone needs to do something for the prince. I was just so happy that he finally found someone who loved him. Why did you have to take that from him. Why!?

I liked Rowan. I hoped there was more than just a friendship but apparently I was wrong. But I still have hope. Aedion was my new favorite character as well.

1437,"This was a recommendation to read from a friend.  It sounded really good before I picked it up.  I normally don't read the long books like this.  Usually I like to keep it at 200-300.  There are some exceptions.  This was 430 pages.  It took me a few days to get it finished and I read other things in between.  I was really nervous because there are like 14 books in the series and they are 7.99 or more.  So, I was taking a risk when I started it.

Dark Lover was really intriguing to read.  Although it took me days to get through thats not a totally bad thing.  There are some parts in it where it got a little slow and it was around the time Mr. X was having his POV or explaining what was going on in his little world.  Lets just say he's nuts.  I skimmed over some of his parts but was ok with everything else.  I enjoyed both Wrath and Beth.  Beth was dealt a pretty bad hand there for awhile.  I felt sympathy for her.  She had NO idea about what she was and Wrath didn't handle that part all THAT well.  So she was shocked and pissed for a wee bit.  I was surprised things got physical quickly for Wrath and Beth.  Wrath you cant help but love.  He's this broody pure vampire King who is going blind but damn he can kick ass.  His instincts never falter and he's totally badass.  He's not been a very good King to his people.  He hasn't ruled at all just headed the BBB for eons.  Thats gonna change though.  So, I won't say anymore but they get their HEA and we meet the brothers who each and every one is unique in a way.  Butch...he's pretty terrific too.  Broody cop and a little brutal with his interrogations.  His story isn't done yet.  So many things in this book.  I recommend.

What I am on the fence about is continuing the series or not.  I think I want to because I want to read about the rest of the brothers I was introduced in this book.  More than that though?  I dunno.  There are 14 books and perhaps she'll do more books in the series.  So, we'll see after I read those.  :)",1,"[-2.6553024114892243, 1.2171352120304908, -2.482927379575416, -1.0915541914506055, -1.5140760136292861]",1.2171352120304908

Oh my goodness!!! What can I possibly say??? This book is excellent and such a phenomenal look into Sam and Tiel's life!!! If you read my review from Necessary Restoration then you know I absolutely did not like Tiel. But let me tell you that this book completely redeemed her!!! In such a way that I feel so bad about dissing her that I want to apologize and start over with her after this book. Im so sorry Tiel. Please forgive me. Anyway it was my extreme dislike for her as to why I put off reading this book for so long. I cannot believe I was so stupid and am kicking myself so hard!!! This book is fantastical!!!  and Im so glad I finally read it!!!

We see Tiel's and Sams relationship in a way that puts everything into perceptive and you cant help cheering them on. You feel their happiness and pain. Oh my god the pain. It tore my heart apart. I can relate all too well with their loss. Kate did such a wonderful  job drawing me in it was as if I was on the sidelines experiencing everything with them. It was emotional it was raw and so very real. So devastating. But the happiness was so consuming and just as powerful!!!

This books is exceptional!!! And after reading it I now believe that Sam and Tiel's relationship is one of the best. They are there for each other no matter what the situation is. They love fiercely. They live by their rules. And if no one likes well thats just too bad. Im so glad that their story wrapped up the way it did. I personally believe their HEA was the best.

2089,"The Letters took me longer to get into than some of Fisher's other books - and the ""feel"" of it was different than her other series, at least in my mind. It's kind of a quiet story about especially quirky characters...but even though they took longer to win me over than I expected, win me over they did.

When I started the book, I was less than impressed. I honestly don't know how much of it was my mood and how much of it was a change in Fisher's writing style (or, more likely, a view of it I just hadn't seen before). The writing seemed choppy and slightly juvenile. While I felt bad for what the characters were going through, I didn't feel overly invested in their lives. Some were sweet, but they either came across as unoriginal or overly quirky.

I kept reading. Little moments elicited chuckles from me. Scenes started to weave together into a bigger picture. Familiar faces dawned on me far later than they did for many other fans, I'm sure, but it was kind of fun to be surprised! And, while the story didn't turn out to be a complete favorite for me, I found myself touched by the gentle lessons and the bonds these characters forged.

The title is a bit misleading, as letters don't play as prominent a role as it might suggest (although that doesn't mean their role isn't important). But if you're looking for a getaway to find some perspective, consider taking a visit to The Inn at Eagle House. You'll be reminded of the joys of love and family, and the peace that comes in knowing you're not alone. And for those who like interconnected books, Fisher just keeps adding layers to the stories and characters she's written, with the promise of more to come!

The premise is simple. Rome didn't fall and kept building its empire all the way across the ocean to America. They meet up with the native people and the fight begins.

As good as the concept was, I found the telling of the story flat. I know that this is a first in a series therefore it will be building a world and creating characters so I expected long descriptions and lots of ""backstory"". I was turned off by how gruesome it was in parts of the march west. I know the natives showed no mercy for their foes, but it was over-descriptive and I had a hard time reading some of it.

I was really hoping for more and I'm not sure I'd look for the rest of the series. My husband is reading it right now and he says it's ""not bad"" so maybe I'm just reading it from a more sensitive point of view. It's a good concept and if the author can make the next book more interesting as far as character development (beyond the main) and add in more conflict (not fighting, internal or character conflict that makes the reader want to either root for or against a character) then there is potential.

Since I tend to read a lot of books, I was afraid I wouldn't remember much when this installment in the Mercy Thompson series came out. I needn't have worried. Once I started reading, I really had a hard time putting it down. Ms. Briggs' writing, plot-detail, and personal interactions between the characters remain wonderfully the same. I was also very glad to see Adam finally stand up to his pack in regards to Mercy. I can't say much because I don't want to spoil anything, but I almost stood up and cheered, I was so happy. Now for the ""bad"" parts of the book. There was a death in this book, and I won't say who or what it was, but I was very sad to see it happen. I was hoping there was a future role for this character to play, and the death was a little anti-climactic. I suppose that disappointment is more my fault, and really a little silly, but it still bothered me. Next, there really wasn't as much action as usual in the Mercy Thompson series. The book focused more on interpersonal and emotional growth of the characters and the pack. That is certainly not a bad thing, but I think action could have played a bigger role than it did amid the growth, especially when they went to Underhill. I missed the action. And, lastly, there was a lot of detail in this book. Much more than usual. I do like detail and know that it is necessary, but it seemed a little over the top. However, I fell in love the series when it first came out and the series does remain one of my favorites. This book is more 4 1/2 stars as opposed to a 5-star book, but I round it out to 5. Go out and get it! It is well-worth a read!

593,"So this is actually the third book I read by Gillian Flynn and I think her other two ruined this one for me. Sharp Objects, and Gone Girlwere both such captivating stories that when I got around to this one I was rather bored. My expectations were higher than they should have been going into this.

Before I get into the heart of my review I must comment that Gillian Flynn is a wonderful writer and her talents clearly show in this book. It is very well written and the characters are well developed, but when it came to the characters, I didn't like a single one of them. Her dark and disturbing style is clearly evident and I like that about her. I like the dark tone of her stories and when I pick up one of her books I have come to expect that. This book was just not my favorite.

One of the reasons I didn't like this books was just that the characters are not likable. I couldn't connect with any of the characters and to be honest I didn't care to much about what happened to them in the end. I actually think I would have enjoyed this better if they all had been wiped out in the end. Again I think her other books, with characters that were interesting and a more in-depth, ruined this book for me. I kept comparing the other books, even thought I know I shouldn't

The other issue I had with this story was the plot itself. There was a lot of potential to be one heck of a mystery while Libby tries to figure out who actually murdered her family. Half way through the book I was bored and not really interested in going further. Still I am stubborn and powered through this audio book. The ending was less thrilling because my interest had wandered and I just wanted it to be over. Still, I can see that Gillian Flynn is a great writer and I loved her other works. I look forward to her next book when ever that is and still think highly of her as an author, this was just one book I didn't enjoy.",1,"[-1.9928699445600615, 1.1898037988710883, -2.1775673321748483, -1.1047146862716397, -1.685357822673184]",1.1898037988710883

1. The Christian theme is just a little heavy-handed; I'd say somewhat more blatant than the Chronicles of Narnia, if you're familiar.
2. The world didn't feel very well-developed; more like a sketch of a world than an actual fictional universe to step into.

I don't agree with the reviewers who think that Eve's actions in the first book are nonsensical, especially regarding Boaz.

The main character in the novel may be reflective of real cops, but it certainly didn't make her likable.  I had a hard time sympathizing with, or understanding, her actions and the way she interacted with her son and her coworkers.  There was just something about her as a lead that made the book a little less attractive to me.  I also didn't really like the way the author portrayed gypsy culture - I know that group has a certain reputation, but it would have been nice to have one such character in the novel with even a single positive attribute.

The story grabs your attention pretty quickly, but it does become bogged down a little in the middle.  I appreciated the gritty, often slow police work but thought that less time could have been spent on that piece and more time spent on character development.

172,"Though this is an entertaining read, it is far from ""five star"" caliber work.  There are weaknesses that the author needs to address if she wants to create better work in future novels.

We have here an affluent suburban neighborhood with residents that one might expect in ""Desperate Housewives"":  Piper, a Queen Bee; Elizabeth, Piper's terminally ill friend; Deveraux,  a teen genius curious about the identity of his birth dad; and Corneila, the newcomer.  This is one of those neighborhoods where all the young children simply must be accepted into the exclusive preschool or (oh my!) their lives are already ruined.  So once we meet the characters and see the neighborhood, we have some idea what to expect.

I wonder, too, how the author came to choose some of the characters' names.  Could she have chosen other, less ""stuffy"" names that would still be appropriate to the characters?  (Hello, baby name books and name meaning websites!)

The plot is just as tangled as ""Desperate Housewives"" or a daytime drama might be, too.  Without giving any spoilers, suffice it to say that there are several plot threads going at once.  This will either keep a reader moving or saying, ""Huh?  Lost me here.  Why pick up that thread right now?""

The author changes point of view several times from Cornelia to Piper to Devereaux.  This in itself is not a problem; many authors do that.  However, more clarity at times about whose ""head"" we're in would be helpful. Maybe a different style of print for each of these three would have helped.

9532,"Snowpiercer tells the story of the near future where a failed climate-change experiment kills all life on the planet except for a lucky few who boarded the Snowpiercer, a train that travels around the globe, where a class system emerges.

I am all about watching a different kind of sci-fi movie and this movie's premise and trailer interested me enough to make me watch.  It had flashes of similarities to a similar story line of ""Hunger Games"" or ""Divergent"" yet had a unique enough premise to draw me into it to watch.

Unfortunately this movie fails to live up to what it promises.  I can get past the whole train setting as kind of nonsensical in the first place but this movie the script itself wanders off the track too many times that it derailed to me early on.  Sometimes books don't translate well into movies and although maybe my lack of familiarity with this story makes it a difficult translation to me, I don't know.  I would just hope that the book has a more cohesive story that what the movie showed.  It is almost that the movie tries too hard to stray out into weirdness territory just to be different.  The basic story is there and underneath the layers it has a lot of potential to be good, but the strange action sequences, weird dialogue and shaky camera shot sequences just left me more annoyed than amused.

This is going to be a movie that some people are going to like for sure with its off center storyline and overall strange feel. It has its messages that it is trying to send, but like the translator in the movie, it didn't get the message very clear to me. I will give it credit for being original and different as for sure that is it what it was.  If you are looking for something out of the norm of the standard type sci-fi then this you may enjoy.  For me, this isn't a terrible film as movie starts to get interesting toward the end but the movie is really hard for me to rate as there were so many things, especially early on that made me dislike the film.",1,"[-2.718077816774475, 1.1681062069333568, -2.029244037039534, -1.0961715212174183, -2.032815348359411]",1.1681062069333568

Linde) suggested to read this series and I didn't have anything new waiting for me on my kindle bookshelf so I decided why not. I did t really have any expectations of this book as I didn't read the blurb before buying or reading it but I can say I really enjoyed this book.
The way that Keatyn makes up scripts in her head for the way things would go in her life is hilarious. I understand why should would do it because she's grown up around movie sets for the majority of her life. Her family dynamic was great and her love triangle made me dizzy.
The one thing I didn't like about Keatyn's character is the fact that she couldn't make up her mind. She would bounce back and forth between Brooklyn and Cush without ever dealing with the feelings she had for one before moving to the next. I felt as if Keatyn didn't know how to be single. She craved a relationship and attention from the opposite sex more than she craved anything else. He back and forth drove me nuts as I wished she could deal with everything happening instead of jumping from one guy to he next. I did feel bad for Cush though as she had to leave without explaining anything to him.
I feel like Keatyn will fall back into old habits and patterns in the new life that she's forced into. Even though she's trying to be different and trying not to follow some ""script"" she dreams about, that's the real nature of who Keatyn is.

3349,"The book opens with "" When youve lost everything, Theres nothing left to lose"" and I believe it perfectly describes the novel which picks up 3 weeks after the wedding. The Lizzy that you may have been rooting for in the previous four novels is gone. The story lines are bleak (child rape, monsters who get away with it, etc.). As usual there are multiple story lines which are left in various stage of completeness.

I wanted to hate this novel as I am a person who needs to believe in the light at the end of the tunnel, the possibility of a happy ending. Once I reconciled myself to the fact that it wasn't going to happen, and it didn't appear important to the author to nurture the emotional connection to the characters, she had spent 4 books building. Once I stopped caring about what happened to the characters and forgot their history, I was able to read the book and found it was okay.

The first 20% intrigued me and seemed like it was building to something great but I've hit a wall and I have no intention of pushing through it. The characters were decent enough, Mason is a ""hip-hop star"" even though I've yet to see any evidence of such (i.e. concerts, writing songs, actually rapping etc..) except for a reality show he's trying to get on. I guess I expected more. This felt sort of like the movie ""8 Mile"" with Eminem, in that Mason's upbringing was oddly reminiscent of Slim Shady's epic start. It's not that it was bad, I actually enjoyed the idea of it but this just fell flat for me. As well as Ellie, whose ""youtube indescretion"" made my eyes bug out when it came to light. I was expecting something more ... I don't know, just...MORE. The big happening was anticlimactic at best. I wanted to give this one a fair chance but I fear the more I read, the more I'll find a typical new adult clich. Already the characters have known each other for a handful of days and the heroine is talking about getting her heart broken by the hero she barely knows.

1098,"""The Accident"" is the title of an anonymous manuscript that shows up one day on a literary agent's desk. The manuscript seems to be absolute dynamite, detailing the moral failings and illegal acts of a media mogul. Almost immediately, several people make copies of the manuscript, and the chase is on as various forces try to destroy those copies before the book can be published or turned into a film.

There is a lot to like here. The characters are not cartoon stereotypes of good and evil but are instead reasonable people with clear motivations and often qualms about their actions, even among the so-called bad guys. Author Pavone develops the characters well by including a great deal of background material, usually presented in long past-tense sections that contrast with the present-tense portion of the book that is the focus. Pages from the manuscript are sprinkled throughout the book to give us an idea what all the fuss is about, and Pavone's understanding of the literary world seems to be good.

But I found that the book was just too busy, and of the big revelations at the end of the book, one was not a revelation but a confirmation of an obvious point. I also had a problem because of the way I read this book. I generally have several books going at once, and this one happened to be the one that I read in fits. I found myself having trouble, at least in the early going, keeping straight who was who. I thought the book could have benefited from a tighter structure.",1,"[-2.5733695000746413, 1.1555625981737019, -2.4222878399187087, -1.1129960939086831, -2.0031374056914526]",1.1555625981737019

9209,"I like many StarWars fans couldn't wait for the original trilogy to come out on dvd. However, I think both versions of the films should be released and just not the Special Editions. I loved the original version of Return of the Jedi and the Special Edition takes the darkness mytery out of the Jabber the Hut scene. I mean the scene with creatures perforrning there is now turned into annoying cgi musical number. It's just goofy and doesn't belong in a scene that is meant to be dark and mysterious.  Well Lucas obviously didn't think it was meant to stay that way. The new score at the end of the Return of the Jedi as well, I think is really bad and I miss the original score. Lucas is too much into effects and todays technology. Mean look at the prequels, if he put more time into the scripts and less into the visuals, the movies might compare with the original movies. Anyway I think the original movies were fine before the special editions. Ok the Jabber the hut and Han Solo scene that was added to the original in entertaning. Some other changes like the ones to Return of the Jedi are really bad though. I heard rumors that Lucas actually wants to make Special Special Editions now but I think he hacked his beloved trilogy to bits enough. I'm still gonna buy these dvd's, don't get me wrong but the original versions should be there as well.

If you've never read the book, suffice it to say that the movie (Planet of the Apes--1968) was a relatively faithful adaptation of the text.  Most of the changes that were made relate to the framing devices used to begin and end the respective stories and some understandable deFrenchifying of the astronauts.
Here again, as in Bridge on the River Kwai (see Orrin's review), Boulle brilliantly succeeds in presenting an idea-rich novel in a minimum number of pages (I read an old movie tie-in copy that was just 128 pages long).  This brevity does a few things: it provides the novel with a headlong narrative drive; it speeds the reader past the holes in the plot and premise; and it makes for a book whose full implications only really become apparent on further reflection.  I think many of the ideas conveyed by the novel are false.  There is no bigger lie in the history of symbols than the schoolroom wall charts of our youth showing the tree of life with man and apes dangling at the end of one branch or the march of species leading from australopithecus, or whoever, on up to homo sapiens, and the book relies heavily on this shaky premise that evolution is just that smooth and linear and that our interconnectedness with the lesser primates is exactly that close.  This is all extraordinarily dubious; but it is assuredly thought provoking and it's great fun besides.

I would even sometimes use these bulbs when I had a sick bird that needed a bit of extra warmth.  (I had an additional UV source for the iguana; was using this one primarily for the heat.)

For years, these were great.  They would last me a long enough time that I would forget how old they were.  I would hardly ever have to buy replacements, and they provided an appropriate amount of heat for the locations in which I placed them.

And then, about a year ago, something happened.  They started burning out in less than a month.  Several of them only lasted 2 weeks.  I even tried replacing the fixtures they were in.  I used both the metal reflective types and the fixtures that are white on the inside and black on the outside.  Brand new or old, it wasn't the fixtures -- the bulbs just kept going out.

I was buying them at a physical store and inspecting them before use and nothing LOOKED out of the ordinary.  The boxes they came in were in good shape.  So it wasn't a problem with shipping, but instead with materials and/or manufacturing.

Anyway, 2 stars because they were good at one time.  Perhaps they'll fix whatever is wrong in their manufacturing process and become good again.

K Webster has managed to not only write one of the most unique and thrilling plots I have ever read, but she incorporated beauty into such an ugly world.

First, I felt K put such an important voice to victims of sexual abuse, mental abuse and physical abuse.

Well.......I liked parts of it and some parts were a touch lacking for me personally.  I LOVED the candy aspects (even though there was nothing mentioned in the book description about it) and in the beginning the mystery was intriguing.  But I figured out the mystery nearly only half way through the book and then it was a little dry once I knew everything, but the characters weren't catching on.  The story as a whole was a little too long for me and I wish the pace had been faster.  I also felt that it started out light hearted and then it changed leads mid-stride and got significantly more serious; which was a little uncomfortable at times.  I wish there had been more candy making/description scenes because I devoured ;) them.  And even though I did have it all figured out, the end scene when the characters figured it out and trapped the bad guy was still a great few scenes.  I just wished it had happened A LOT sooner. :)  Overall there where scenes that I truly enjoyed, but the book as a whole fell a little flat.  If your looking for a book with interesting candy making, business scenes, Faith scenes, and pretty good characters, but not an advanced mystery, this may be the book for you.

5821,"""Gathering Storm"" was an interesting and entertaining read.  The reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because the author never explained how the ""Lost"" incident occurred, she never specified to which dimension our lost hero landed, she failed to make it clear exactly in which dimension and what time period certain crucial events took place, i.e. woman scorned shoots character in the face.  I actually reread certain passages in an attempt to gain some clarity regarding the last two issues without success.  It was something that as a reader I shouldn't have had to do, it was irritating and it was a waste of my time.  For an author who has consistently  focused on providing detailed descriptions, sometime irritatingly so, the lack of clarity on such an important plot thread/detail, to say the least, was frustrating.
Despite these short comings, I still managed to enjoy the story well enough.  The plot was fairly imaginative and intriguing.  The characters were likable and believable.  However, I didn't find all the events surrounding Rosie completely feasible even for fiction.  As usual, reading the story elicited a wide range of emotions, e.g. laughter, sadness, concern, sympathy, anger.... The lost of a one of my favorite ""cornerstone"" characters was both shocking and saddening.  The storyline moved along at a faster pace than the last book.  Just about all of the characters from previous books at least made an appearance.  The story contained action, adventure, a wee bit of suspense, humor and romance.

There are two voices, Neil, the old flame, and Mary, a woman whose mother was killed and whose father was convicted of that murder.
 What was difficult for me was at just about every chapter you didn't know what time frame things were being discussed.

Every chapter started off with something that was happening, or a conversation that was going on, but without putting a date at the beginning of the chapter you don't know when it was. Sometimes it was when they were teenagers, sometimes it was when they were adults, or children, sometimes it was recent or right now, but it wasn't readily understandable when that chapter took place.
 I don't know, it was just confusing. I was never really sympathetic towards any of the characters but the old uncle, who is waiting for God to take him home, and Mary's father, because he was going to  be convicted of something he didn't do.

1138,"Hyperion and its sequel tell a story that is rich in detail and astounding in scope.  Many complain that they are so very different and Simmons changes his style so drastically.  While I cannot argue with the observation, I think the two books are very different and their goal is to tell very different stories.  The first is an exploration of a small group of diverse characters learning about each other and the stange common threat that connects them, in a chaucer like group of short stories.  The second, however, is a powerful adventure story about social evolution, science, and political intrigue.
Different?  Yes, but they compliment each other beautifully.  If, like me, you were facinated by the universe Simmons created and the issues of how societies form that he explores, than I think you will enjoy reading this.

Fatal Knockout began as a book that immediately captured my attention. I love MMA books, so I was really excited to read this. The connection between Blaze and Madisyn was sweet and I really did like that. The problem that I had with the book was that after the second chapter it skips ahead 10 years.  The skip in years was just very sudden and really with no development in the characters. Some of the characters were just thrown in the middle of a paragraph and I was confused as to who was speaking in the middle of  paragraphs.

The actual story line I did like, but it was really confusing as to what the background was on some of the plot. This story does end on a major cliffhanger and I will probably read the next one just so I can see where the author takes the story.",1,"[-1.8737541384174872, 1.122059005033451, -2.17873748077216, -1.0794541231591666, -1.8005967495785726]",1.122059005033451
1504,"I have read (and loved) every single Fannie Flagg book ever published, and it pains me to give one of her books only 3 stars, but I just did not care for this book nearly as much as her previous novels. I think the main thing that turned me off was not understanding why exactly Margaret wanted to commit suicide in the first place. Because she's no longer Miss Alabama? Because she had an affair with a married man 40 years ago? Because she didn't marry her teenage sweetheart? All pretty weak reasons to drown yourself in a lake.

Another issue for me was how neat and clean everything was wrapped up. I realize all Fannie's novels have happy endings, and I look forward to that, but in this book it just felt forced and extremely far-fetched. Especially the surprise at the end. Funny how that all worked out. And I KNEW Babs would end up getting hers in the end, but it was all so rushed. Just a paragraph explained her downfall.

Also, while I liked Margaret, I certainly didn't love her. She was much more likeable though when compared to her 'friends' (with the exception of Hazel). Every time Margaret tried to broach the topic of cluing Brenda into her suicide plans, she would always ignore Margaret's silent plea and turn the conversation to herself. I thought it was extremely selfish and it really made me not like her.

Overall, I just did not love this book. It's been 4 years since Fannie's published a book, and this is the first time I've ever been disappointed with one of her novels.

I brushed his hair out of his stricken face with a soft touch, wanting to comfort the things I saw in his eyes so clearly.  It was such a reflection of my own torment.  His soul was a mirror of my own. Perhaps his insane claim that we were made for each other wasn't so very far off the mark.  I had known him for such a short time, but somehow I felt I could read him so perfectly, so naturally, that it astounded me.

Wow was this an emotional book for me. With the title of being unwanted, of course, it was going to be heartbreaking. Theresa was married to someone she loved with all of her heart and he was only married to her for convenience. Having a deal with her father, who was the most terrible kind of person, he thought she knew about the deal and resented her so much.
She didn't know about it though, she truly loved him.
The way he treated her and made her feel, made me sick. I couldn't imagine being with someone who treated me so awful but I guess she was kind of used to it, with the way her father always treated her.
He hurt her with his words and his rejection. Man, I couldn't go a few pages without tearing up.

Then, when Alessandro learned the truth about his wife and her genuine feelings towards him, it was too little too late for her. I don't know if I would've put up with so much stuff from him but I've also never been in that situation and I guess it would be hard for me to understand what I would put up with, if I truly loved someone as she did Sandro.
I might have backhanded him a time or two, and cheating I could never put up with, no matter what *he didn't do it, but she thinks throughout the story that he did*

It was just heartbreaking, all of it. I did enjoy Sandro's change of heart and i""m glad she made him suffer, trying to win her back. I did, even though I hated myself for it, found myself, feeling sorry him a time or two though...

A woman who thinks she is crazy is rescued from evil scientists, and discovers that she is a werewolf.

Some of the individual scenes are interesting and well written, but the overall plot meanders without focus. The major elements are evil scientists and discovering the paranormal (""wow, I'm a werewolf""). The evil scientist plot has been done too many times. This implementation was too weak to hold my interest: not well motivated and ridiculously over-the-top. The ""I'm paranormal not crazy"" plot had more potential but was poorly executed. The story read like it desperately needed a continuity expert. For example, it was unconvincing that she was close friends with other werewolves as an adult and this never came up in conversation--despite it being obvious to them that she was a werewolf.

Other books in this series are romances. This one pretty much isn't, greatly to its detriment. There was a lackluster romance subplot, mostly ignored. There are occasional blurts of text showing attraction between H and h, but these were few and far between.

The character was unapologetically dark, moronic, obnoxious and rude with the saving grace of totally and absolute love. That said, the h character was mediocre.  The false equivalency of the H and the sister and the h and the best friend is disingenuous.

The musical score was excellent The acting was quite good, if you like the stiff British style. I can think of a lot of good things to say about this movie. And I note at the bottom of the DVD case that it was labeled ""Best Picture of the Year"" by the National Board of Review, whatever that is.

Well, I just didn't particularly care for the movie, well done though it was. The film was long, very slow moving, almost glacial in it's pace, and, in a word, boring. I just never could get into the story. After a while, I kept looking at my watch wondering when it would be over. Then I started getting up to get things without putting it on pause. Then I stopped it for a while and went out to check my email on the computer. It was that kind of movie for me. Okay, I'll take the blame. All you need to do is look at the ratings and comments to see that many others loved it. It's a well-done movie, without question. By all means check it out and read a lot of the better reviews. You may love it. Then again.

1544,"I finally got around to reading a book by Amy Bloom, about whom I've heard many good things over the years.  Well, perhaps this is not her best work, but given that all of her books tend to get four stars or so on Amazon, I'm inclined to think it's a typical book.  In any case, it's disappointing.

The book is a fictional memoir of sorts of Lorena Hickok, a tough-as-nails reporter in the 1920s and 1930s, who befriends  Eleanor Roosevelt and is rumored (or perhaps more?) to have been her lover.  The book takes place after FDR's death in Ms. Roosevelt's NYC apartment, with virtually constant flashbacks to their better days together.  There evidently has been some sort of falling out, or at least a cooling of the relationship, between the two, but it's not really explained.

The blurbs on the book suggest that Ms. Bloom really knows how to depict love, the fact that it's same-sex love being merely coincidental.  I'm fine with that, but that is not what Ms. Bloom does.  Among other things, she's chosen as her narrator a hard woman who is so matter-of-fact about love (as well as sex) that it's hard to feel much if anything for the couple.  There's a conveniently parallel story (or a partial story) about a male Roosevelt cousin who is also gay, but it's unclear what that's supposed to prove; that homosexuals had a rough time of it?  That's not new and does nothing to illuminate the relationship between Hickok and the First Lady.

In short, the book is emotionally cold, and that makes it hard for me to see why people thinks Ms. Bloom has written about love so effectively.  She writes well, and the story flows easily, but that's really all there is; emotionally, it left me cold and not caring very much about either protagonist, but particularly the ""heroine"", Ms. Hickok.",1,"[-2.9274685641318734, 1.0894021950036554, -2.488121425574234, -1.0977977836264812, -1.4872934020915016]",1.0894021950036554

It has romance, drama, love and sexiness that make this book and the series highly sensual and insanely attractive!

The story is as complex as it is simple. It is intriguing, intense and melts your heart and mind. It brings you up and tears you down. It is a ride you do not want to miss. This is a journey you have to follow through.

The characters grow both individually and as a couple. They get stronger and overcome every hurdle comes their way. Its not easy, but then; what is? Certainly not love.

Embry and Luke have been through so much. And yet, their love is strong as ever. Even they think everything is lost. Even when things get dark and uncertain. Their love is still there. They are still there for each other. No matter what.

Embry and Lukes love is breathtaking and absolutely mindblowing.

It is epic.

3571,"First of all, I don't think this book is categorized properly in the religious fiction section.  The characters make very little Reference to God or their faith.  The references that are made seem weak at best.  Would Christian characters walk around talking about how ""hot"" someone was or their attractiveness of the other persons bottom when bent over?  I'm not suggesting that Christians are perfect, however, I didn't see any particular character in this novel that was very mature in their faith. How about putting a parameter around kissing for an hour a day with someone you barely had dated?  The book mentions a ton of kissing and attraction but is very tame by most romance novels standards so at least it was free of heavy sexual elements.

Setting aside my own feelings a to whether this book was categorized properly,  I am judging this book as if it was in the romantic suspense category.  It was very average to me.  Not horrible but also not one I could personally recommend.  It didn't seem fully edited.  The characters seemed contradictory and the plot far fetched.  I don't want to go into details and spoil the plot, but by the end there were too many elements to make it seem believable.  These also occurred throughout.  When the male lead in the story catches someone peering through his bushes he doesn't do anything about it.  When someone messes with their car engine shortly after this again no follow up or mention of it again.  Later, the female lead is almost run off the road while out running and the person shouts mean things at her.  She never mentions it to anyone.  These details made me find the story unbelievable.

It's moderately interesting, but lack of character development means you don't really care what happens to Guy Montag as he breaks away from authority. Will the Mechanical Hound get him? Or not? Whatever...

Despite its feeling at times like a book written for a teen audience, Bradbury DOES give us something to think about. Although inspired by the 1950s world of McCarthyism and restriction of books, it has become relevant in a new way to 21st century readers: our society too is in danger of 'dumbing down' with endless entertainment and meaningless chat (witness everyone texting or tuned in to an IPod as they walk along, paying no attention to the world around them); angry young people kill for kicks just like Mildred Montag:

At first I didn't know what to think about the premise. In 1944 a young girl's brutally raped in the Louisiana woods by three solders. Seven years later she unknowingly falls in love with one of her attackers. I figured once she found out the truth, that would be the end of the affair. I didn't see how it could possibly go any other way and I'd still like the story. But it did.

Now, I've never been in a situation such as Charlotte's, and I know some reviewers here had a real problem with the story, but I think because it was just purely fiction to me, I was able to enjoy it, and find it somewhat believable.

It is such a touching, emotional book, but with such hope and peace in it that you will be amazed.
  It really would be a great help to someone who is going through losing a loved one and feeling all alone. This book The Color of Rain is really a precious story.
  Gina and her husband have two little boys and then Gina's husband gets cancer and passes away after several years of fighting it.
  Michael and his wife have two boys and one girl and then Michael's wife gets cancer, but passes away in a matter of weeks. Both of those chapters are so touching and heartbreaking, but full of faith and love.
  Both of the people who pass away went to school together.  So they know of each other and have meet each other at their children's school.
  Then Gina tries to give Michael support because she went through death first and she is a great help, but Michael is a help to her also.
  They share much in their lives and their children become the best of friends. So this is a very special story that takes you through many different stages in life, loss and healing. I really do love this book and know it is a book you will want to read. I highly recommend The Color of Rain for you.

It comes with all of the action, bravado and techno-babble of a typical Clancy tale.  Frankly, other than for marketing, Greaney's writing stands on its own and I'd buy his Jack Ryan novels without a second thought.

The tale itself is complex with many characters, sub-plots and geographies.  It was not difficult to keep them straight, however. The climax, conclusion and epilogue were satisfying.

The only downside was that this book is HEAVY.  I'm used to using my Kindle.  This book was purchased for me as a gift and I forgot how cumbersome print media can be in a large tome.  Not very comfortable reading this novel in bed at night.  Bezos gets a pat on the back from me for the Kindle.

9410,"This movie does as much to make fun of the horror genre than it does to actually be a horror movie itself.  It is definitely not typical in that it also tells the story of two lifelong friends that have grown apart, and the one only realizes it after the other is possessed by a demon and starts killing off the boys in high school.  It is not just a hack and slash kind of movie, and if that is something that you need in a horror movie, then best to just skip this.

There are funny moments, gory moments even dramatic moments in the story and they all work well.  The acting is decent, and I think the script was good.  Better than what you get in a lot of horror movies.  There is not the gratuitous nudity that you get in a lot of horror movies. Megan Fox is in some skimpy outfits, but everything stays covered up.  There is however a good two-minute sequence of her and Amanda Seyfried making out which is as spectacular as it sounds (if you are into that sort of thing).

The A/V quality of the movie on blu ray is very good, and for those who do get the discs there are quite a bit of behind the scenes and making of material.  You also get the theatrical and unrated versions of the film.  The unrated version just adds a little more footage in, but is not radically different than the theatrical version.  Ultimately whether you like this or not is going to be totally subjective.  I don't think you have to like it because Diablo Cody wrote it, or a particular actor or actress is in it, but chances are if you are fans of any of the individuals involved, and the horror genre (depending on your tastes) you will like it.",1,"[-2.7820066126447633, 1.0592784925971959, -2.090756196355596, -1.0868295762530749, -1.9756687153242778]",1.0592784925971959

I have read most, if not all, of her books, and within minutes I am always immersed.  I do, however, find the graphic violence hard to take, and agree with the reviewers who thought the in ""Pretty Girls"" it was over the top.  About 3/4 of the way through I just stopped reading and looked at the end.  I also agree that the plot was almost incidental to all the violence; I think the book was intended to focus more on the characters and what an early tragedy did to their lives than to be intricately plotted, but it didn't hold together well enough for me.  Too much coincidence was needed to make the solution work.  I also agree that at least some  of the characters -- in particular the chief villain -- seemed implausible, as did the scope of the conspiracy and the failure of anyone to notice for decades that a serial killer was among them.

I'm not sure why it was so highly rated or why it's listed as
""THE TOP TEN AMAZON KINDLE eBOOK BESTSELLER
THE NO. 1 BESTSELLING HARD-BOILED MYSTERY
THE NO. 1 BESTSELLING PSYCHOLOGICAL SUSPENSE THRILLER""

With all these endorsements I really expected a book that would keep me on the edge of my seat and with an engaging protagonist.  I was let down.  I just couldn't connect with the down and out ""Keeper"".  I could understand adding the background and trauma of the Attica riots, but some of the flashbacks and descriptive narrative just seemed like filler to me.  And as another reviewer noted elsewhere, whenever the Keeper interacts with women, it's like he's in heat.  Maybe that is the author's take on how a newly widowed, single man reacts to every woman he meets, but it seemed a little gratuitous to me.

The involved plot was okay but the main characters weren't fleshed out enough.  The real villian and puppetmaster, Pelton, was only nominally interesting.  And yes, there are a few typos to detract, but I easily overlooked those.  The ending chapters dragged and I felt were kind of just tacked on, not really adding much after the climax and denoument.

1601,"It's quite interesting to discover that with the publication of each of Dean Koontz's books, there is a formula at work: each year the stories improve, while the writing suffers.  By the Light of the Moon is no exception, with a writing style that often annoys, with its stupidly open manner and constantly inane similes that force the reader to question why bother?  The trick is to stick with it to the end, and By the Light of the Moon eventually pays off.

The story is an average one that seems to be all the rage at the moment: three characters (one an autistic man of twenty) are injected with an unknown golden liquid by a mad scientist subdues them, ties them up, and then sticks in the big needle.  There is the warning from the doctor that the effects of this liquid can be both good and bad, and then he flees.

So the three characters are irrevocably brought together to fight for their survival.  Fortunately, it turns out that the mysterious liquid does good for all of them: one gains the ability, by touching objects, to know who last touched it and if they are evil, and is unable to stop himself from ending that evil.  Another has visions of the future that actually will happen somewhere at some time.  While the autistic man has the great ability to be able to fold time and space, transporting him and anyone else to anywhere and at any time, whether it be the past, present, or future, presumably.

One would think this a great story, but the simplistic and annoying writing keeps getting in the way, as well as the plot that has very little depth.  But ultimately, By the Light of the Moon is worth working through for the amusing ending.

2887,"I agree with the other reviewers that this book is not up to the authors' usual standard.  There does not seem to be a ""main"" plot; the focus of the story is giving backstory to the other Nina Reilly books.  It's like one long chapter in a book-to-come. It did make for a pleasant evening's reading, though.

I agree with the reviewer who could not recognize Nina.  Usually I find her a little too cold and hard for my taste; here she exhibits superhuman stamina, but way too much emotion.  It's a little harsh to say she acts like she's in heat, but she does seem surprisingly interested in sex for someone as exhausted as she must be.

More importantly, I cannot believe that a woman as intelligent as Nina could ""accidentally"" become pregnant in the 1990s.  Affordable, efficient birth control has been easy to come by for DECADES; I do not think the accidental pregnancy plot is acceptable any more without a pretty strong story explaining how it could happen -- like maybe a poor teenager from a fiercely religious background and a weak self-image.

1803,"This story, like many Picoult novels, is told from many different points of view -- little Willow O'Keefe, each of her parents, her sister, and her parents' attorney.  Willow is born with a syndrome called Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI); her bones are so very fragile that the slightest jolt can lead to a major fracture.  A trip to Disneyland turned into disaster because of Willow's problem.  However, this incident led the parents' lawyer to bring up the idea of suing the obstetrician (who is also a close friend of the mother) for malpractice.  The parents are in conflict over bringing suit.  The obstetrician -- well, I don't want to give spoilers there.  Willow's older sister engages in risky behaviors to get attention.  The lawyer has her own ""baggage"" to deal with as well.

This novel did keep my attention; I absolutely wanted to see how things worked out.

That quote was spoken from the 14 year old daughter of the hero and heroine of this story. Excuse me while I puke....

****puke, puke, puke, puke!!!****

I thought this was going to be a saucy/sweet second chance romance but so far, all I've found was:

1.) An icky POV from a 14 year old discussing graphic sexual details
2.) A juvenile hero and heroine who intentionally make each other jealous
3.) Zero degrees of separation between the hero's brother dating the heroine
4.) Too many friggin' characters to keep track of
5.) An uncomfortable monologue from the hero about his ""blooming"" daughter
6.) Absolutely ridiculous labels for private parts

I tried to keep reading past the first instance that squicked me out just to give it a fair shot but I wish I had stopped then after reading the quote above. I wanted to like this one because the dynamic between Sam and Nick was intriguing at first but I draw the line at sexually exploiting young teenage girls. I didn't fell like her POV was even necessary to begin with, especially adding her graphically detailed sexual intentions/feelings.

Perhaps this was not a good first choice (I will try another), but I found _The Prague Cemetery_ to be confusing, tedious and a struggle to stay interested.  I rarely quit reading a book mid-way through, but I did so in this case.

The book is a series of diary entries, the identity of the protagonist is difficult to determine: he either suffers from multiple personality disorder or is merely having a laugh at our expense - it was never clear to me (even after reading the first 120 pages).  To complicate matters further, Eco jumps around in time, adding a whole other level of confusion and mystery to who our narrator is and what he's on about.

In spite of my struggles and ultimate failure to finish the book, it is clearly apparent that Eco is a gifted writer.  The voice(s) of Simonini are witty - funny, even, as he is abrasive, cantankerous, deeply mysogynisitc and prejudiced against all manner of people from the French to the Freemasons to Jesuitis - yet in spite of these repugnant character traits, he is not without some redeeming features.  This is no easy feat for a writer to pull off, and Eco does so masterfully.

I am disappointed in my choice, but will absolutely give Eco another chance.  It seems, sadly, that _The Prague Cemetery_ was just not a good choice for an introduction to Eco's writing.",1,"[-2.792066521409337, 1.0240038481338152, -2.832734054570243, -1.1055878857622095, -1.9267865918254878]",1.0240038481338152

Choices get made without much contemplation or even consideration, and then are not really examined when results don't match expectations. It is a fast moving book, for all that, with surprises. Things that seem to be foreshadowed aren't, and there is a sideways slant to much of the story, but isn't that what happens when we don't think first.",1,"[-2.5042433708503737, 1.0152597863712471, -2.1518070181077897, -1.0635226202468921, -2.0798951828939827]",1.0152597863712471
194,"This book reads like an expanded Curriculum Vitae with a few personal (e.g. non theater related) stories thrown in.  The first half of the book is essentially a litany of plays that Lithgow acted in, watched, or was involved in in some way while in high school.

If you absolutely love theater and are interested in every aspect of his involvement in every Shakespeare play imaginable, then it might hold your interest, but it seemed redundant to me and didn't hold my interest at all.  I'm not saying it isn't relevant but I do question whether he needed 150 pages to talk about it.  10 pages would have summarized it all quite nicely.

About half way through the book he moves to New York and the book picks up some.  The stories about pounding the pavement for work and other anecdotes spice it up a little.  It also (briefly) gets deeply personal in a few places as he discusses his first marriage falling apart and his marriage to his second wife.

Having said that, 95% of the book glosses over his personal life entirely which was more what I was interested in (and more what memoirs are usually about).  I was surprised when he left his first wife because he didn't mention any problems with his marriage until right before he talks about leaving.  They were married 10 years.  You'd think at some point he would have mentioned problems but your introduction to his marriage being on the rocks is ""I had 8 affairs"", after page 200 something.

So basically I found the book unbalanced and repetitive.  There is extensive detail about every professional thing he's done, a few personal snippets (which are interesting), and heavily weighted toward his adolescence and the beginning of his career.

Tropper's book, This is Where I Leave You, was side-splittingly funny and although there wasn't much of a plot (dysfunctional family is 'guilted' into spending a week together) the relationships that were written about and the awkwardness of the forced togetherness make for a page-turning read.

He gets lost at sea, and the girl, alone on the island, must do what she can to survive and also locate her dad. She communicates with a writer, played by Jodie Foster.

Now, don't you think that this guy, being a man of science and living on that island for some time now, would have been astute enough to see that there was a storm coming and to not go sailing on that particular day? Also, this island has a mountain on it which is quite steep and treacherous, yet, this girl walks up and down it as if its a 12 foot hill.

The Jodie Foster character is an agoraphobic who hasn't left her apartment for months, yet she is able to find her way to the island in a matter of a couple of days, when she has never heard of it before, and only has a vague idea of where it is located. I didn't understand why she was in the movie anyway. I thought her character was going to help the girl find her father, but that wasn't the case.

9364,"I really enjoy these collaborations with Christopher Guest & Company but I noticed with the last, A MIGHTY WIND, that the films are so close to what they're satirizing that they could be mistaken for the genuine article.  There are moments in A MIGHTY WIND that could very well be a PBS show about folk music.

That is even more the case with FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.

I watched the film the first time through and didn't really laugh at much.  It looked too real, too genuine.  With Hollywood as its setting, I wondered if this film was too laid back in its approach to goofing on the foibles of actors and show biz.  I've heard of much worse from real human beings (you can argue about whether some Hollywood types are even real people).

So it was in the second viewing that I could see the humor.  The comedy is so subtle that it slips by at first.  Except for Fred Willard.  He's always laugh out-loud funny the first time through.  For me the biggest laughs are mostly the spoofs of television shows covering Hollywood, whether it's Ward asking the dumbest questions in the world for an ""Entertainment Tonight"" parody or the equally-cluess ""Wake Up L.A."" morning show.

Catherine O'Hara was awesome.  Parker Posey was great too.  I thought Eugene Levy was underused.  And Christopher Guest literally is the director he plays.  He does such a great job of turning into that guy that you might miss how funny he is.

3003,"We do not lack for books about the making of movies.  The movies under discussion can be very good (Aljean Harmetz's ROUND UP THE USUAL SUSPECTS, about Casablanca) or very bad (Steven Bach's FINAL CUT, about Heaven's Gate) or even merely disappointing (Lillian Ross's PICTURE, about The Red Badge of Courage).  Such books aren't funny, except in the sense of occasional comic relief.  But THE DISASTER ARTIST is as different in its approach as the subject it follows, a self-made emigre and would-be  *auteur* named Tommy Wiseau, who wrote, produced, directed and starred in his own vehicle, THE ROOM.  Not only has Wiseau's movie little in common with the product of standard Hollywood journeyman, it's surprisingly difficult to type, or even rate:  for example, Amazon reviewers give the movie 4.4 stars out of five, while imdB reviewers, amateurs also, give it a mere 3.5 -- out of ten.

Greg Sestero was cast as the good-looking interloper in what is supposed to be a romantic melodrama but veers off course so often that it provokes laughter and groans as much as true appreciation.  He is also co-author of this warts-and-all account along with Tom Bissell.  For my money, the real humor in this book comes not so much as the added sarcasm (""beardosaurus"") as the satires of circumstance that follow Tommy Wiseau, a firm believer in the American dream that with enough drive and ample money, success is bound to follow.  Never mind talent or experience.  The irony -- and coda to the fun of following the unbridled Wiseau around -- is what happens to the movie, which by all accounts should have been a six-million-Dollar flopperoo.  I can heartily endorse THE DISASTER ARTIST, but shy away from giving it the full five stars because Sestero (perhaps aided by his co-author) puts himself front and center a little too much.

The story of Elizabeth, a dedicated wife, mother, and friend who at age 38 suddenly passed away in a plane crash and left her best friend her diaries, captured me from the beginning. The mystery of why she left the journals to Kate, and not to her husband Dave, kept me reading feverishly. And then something changed.

After awhile, I lost interest. The book started to drag. The diary entries came less frequently and were replaced with long explanations of Kate's thought processes, but they were mostly centered around herself and her life with her husband and children. She uses Elizabeth's memoirs to understand her own life, and the more she does this, the less dependent she becomes on Elizabeth's for guidance.

The problem with this for me was that I didn't particularly like Kate, and I wanted to know more about Elizabeth. Toward the end of the novel, I was just skimming, forcing myself to finish. I did, and the ending was just as unsatisfying as I thought it would be.

If Kate were a real person, I'd be happy that she found clarity through her friend's personal thoughts, but no more interested in her.

But, for me, these books do one thing, one rare thing, that keeps me coming back. They make me laugh. Laugh out loud. Repeatedly. And I've come to realize that in return for that, I'm willing to overlook the other aspects of the series that annoy me.

Those of you who have read the earlier books in this series will find more of the same in Takedown Twenty.  Zany characters, abundant stupidity, massive mayhem, near-death experiences, smashed cars, the Big Blue Buick, Cluck in a Bucket, Ranger riding to the rescue, and Morelli showing up for sex.

They stripped out everything that made the first movie intense and interesting and rehashed it together with a boring villain with zero charisma or believability. What made the first one worth watching was the vengeful Dad angle--who could forget the great lines ""It was all personal to me"" or the ""special set of skills"" line? While  straining believability at times, the first TAKEN offered a solid through line to follow and made Neeson easy to cheer for.

TAKEN 2 suffers from bad acting, bad plotting, a bad antagonist, and a bad concluding act. The third act came and went so fast that I thought ""surely that's not it?"" and then the movie ended. The movies was just a collection of action tropes linked together without any soul, charm, or inventiveness.

And it's only a little more recently that I started reading LGBT+ romance. Honestly, it's fairly recently that I even discovered it exists and have been kind of devouring it ever since, because het gender tropes make me crazy. (But I'm drifting.)

I'm newish to romance and though I enjoy it now, I still can't quite stand undiluted romance. If there isn't some other aspect to the plot beyond X & Y meet and fall in love, I'm out. So, despite being by one of my favorite authors, I put this book off. Eventually however, it just irritated me to no end to have one more AJH book out there that I hadn't read and gave in to its lure.

I'm glad I did because Ash's mental health, exhaustive anxiety and over-thinking was enough to keep me interested beyond the romance and sex (of which there was plenty). He's an eminently unlikable character, that dislike only partially negated by being pitiable. And Darian was just a darling. Presenting as shallow and simple, he was surprisingly adept at reading people and situations. He was also possibly the most forgiving human on earth.

This was my only real complaint with the book. I loved that he forgave Ash his many very serious foibles, but i thought he let some of them slide too easily, that last one especially. He felt a little door-mat like.

Then there is the Essex cant. A lot of readers disliked this. I however loved it. I thought it gave Darian's character such personality and made reading the book more colorful and enjoyable.

 Roger Rabbit has been framed for murder by an evil toon and only one man can save him, the former detective for toons Eddie Valent. Eddie Valent used to take cases for toons until one killed his brother. He has to come face to face with his past in-order to save Roger.
 Bob Hoskins is great as Eddie Valent as is Christopher Lloyd as the villain. It's the special effects that are the real star in Who Framed Roger Rabbit though. They're flawless and you get the feel that the actors are really talking and interacting with the toons.
 I really would of loved if they made a few sequels but it's a little late for that now since you don't really see Bob Hoskins around anymore. He had much more star power then than he does now as well.
 The only problem that I still have with the film is that it has a very adult theme to it and isn't as much for kids as a movie with a bunch of famous cartoon characters should be. There's one point where Donald Duck calls Daffy Duck a really bad prejudice word for instance. You have to listen hard to hear it but it's there. Still though Daffy versues Donald is so much fun that I wouldn't mind a sequel just to see go at it again.

Especially the casting, this movie is a classic and pricey example of how wonderful actors can be wasted in a single movie when chemistry and styles are missing and out of sync.
Billy Crystal is a good choice for the publicist role.  Well, he wrote the script and he may have tailored made this part for himself.  At least he knew what worked for him.
John Cusack: a great actor with off beat comic timing.  But he's totally out of sync with the rest of the cast here.  I tend to believe he did this one for $ and for the chance to work with Julia and Company.
Catherine Zeta-Jones: a beautiful woman with meat and curve on her body (a very realistic womanly woman).  But this seems like a reprise from her supporting role in ""High Fidelity"", the same self-serving, selfish, and egotistic character.  She's getting too good at playing this kind of woman.  Makes me wonder if she's like this in real life.  :)  A big plus is for us to have a peak at her upcoming role in ""Chicago"".
Julia Roberts: boy what can I say?  She's got charisma and she can't hide it.  So to play a role with mousy hair and fat suit is just not convincing to me.

I have to say that Doe is one of the strongest female leads I've ever read!  Is she perfect, no but she has so much inner strength with all that she went through and continued to go through in this book.  One thing that I loved is how there was never any doubt at least to me that her and KING would make it through.  It wasn't easy and there were added circumstances that changed things up but this is a great conclusion to KING and Doe's story.

I was also puzzled by the sudden inclusion of characters such as Hest and Seldrin, who were absent from book two. I think it would have felt more natural to have seen them in the previous book; their appearance in this volume felt forced. The book also felt very much a placeholder, which makes sense as it was apparently part of a much larger story that was cut into two volumes. Now for the good. Ms. Hobb is a very talented writer and makes you believe in her characters. Although this book lacked the fire of the previous two volumes, it's still very well written and totally envelops you in the storyline. You can see the characters while reading the story and you care what happens to them.

What we have makes no sense outside of this cabin. It defies the rules and logic we were forced to learn. Laws are being brokenall of them Im guilty of. Despite the chances were taking to be together, Im diving headfirst. I don't stop to think about repercussions or reality.

This speech pretty much explains this story without giving you any spoilers which honestly I refuse to give.  As always it's very hard to write a Webster review without spoiling things.  So I'll try to be as vague as possible..

Something's you need to understand, this book is the most taboo story I think I've ever read in my life and its not taboo lite either.  This is twisted throw preconceived notions out the window,  I need a shower and a call to Jesus after reading this story.  Be WARNED!  I honestly feel dirty and sick loving this story as I am.  But K webster does this to me,  she breaks everyone of my hard limits and has me curled in the corner shaking begging for more.

5 stars but again only because I can't offer anymore,  the story is intense but I still as terrible and taboo as it is I rooted for a happy ending for these two,  and that to me is worth more then anything,  rooting for something so dark and taboo but in the end they just want to love each other forever isn't that what all of us want,  somebody who thinks you hung the moon and would die literally curl up and seise to be if anything ever happened to you?

This book was free and looked cute so I grabbed it up to hold for a day when it fit my mood.  A couple months later I finally opened it up and what I got was a bit surprising.  Basically I was disappointed.  Xavier is an a$$.  I have read many books with guys who are asses, it is fine when they have redeeming qualities but I really could find none in Xavier.  Further more his character did not seem well established.  One minute he is one way and the next another resulting in mental whiplash.  It almost seemed like his character had not been fully fleshed out.  There were times when I was liking him but again the mental whiplash would occur when his a$$hole tendency reared it's ugly head in a way so unneeded and unattractive that I found no inherent desire for this character in anyway.

Then there is Lola, a strong independent young woman who seems to have a back bone and no fear but at the same time is annoyingly naive.  Why, WHY would you go work for him?  I felt like I was getting to know her character well enough by the time she made this decision that she would have told him to eff off and turned the offer down but instead becomes this big pile of stupid and does it anyways.

I have read many books where the female lead is attracted to the male a$$hat and is conflicted by their desire and their dislike of the guy but 1) usually the guy has one redeeming quality that you latch onto because it results in endearing him to you, the reader, and the female lead 2)They at least seem to have a bit of a back bone and must be somewhat seduced or placed into needing to do something they don't want to because of extraneous circumstances.

9454,"Fair warning, this will contain spoilers from season 2 and some spolerish material from season 3, but no major season 3 giveaways.

This season is all about Division vs Amanda.  That is the new Division that was created after Percy was killed and Amanda exiled at the end of season 2.  Melinda Clarke really gets to flex her muscles as a bad guy this season.  She is the main antagonist throughout the season, although the new Division (now headed by the ex CIA analyst Ryan Fletcher) faces threats from Amanda and from inside the government that is allowing them to operate.  More and more of the backstory is being told (including more of Amanda's origins) all leading up the the truncated final season.

Like is the case with the prior seasons, this one begins and ends with the characters in very different circumstances.  There are several twists and turns throughout the season, some which are harder to buy than others.  This is however a show that you have to suspend your disbelief a lot.  If you try to look for logic in everything it will frustrate you to no end.  The season ends on a storyline cliffhanger that threatens all of the main characters, but one above the others.

If you like the format of the previous seasons then you will like this one.  The writing and acting are pretty much on par with the prior seasons, but the writers do seem to want to be a little clever with the twists.  Some work, some not so much.  But all the characters having shades of gray, even among the ""good guys"" continues.

For those who get the discs, the A/V quality of the blu rays is great as you would expect.  As far as extras go, there are some deleted scenes on select episodes and a gag reel.  Definitely less than in prior seasons.

The plot was a little different, but it was entirely enjoyable. I was a little surprised by some twists and turns and there were a few of such that were maybe a little unnecessary, but on the whole, I didn't find a single thing about the plot objectionable. The humor was spot on and well done. I like it when my historical romances have plenty of fun peppered in - and this one was very funny. (Might I say, I really liked the tree scene, and then later, the treehouse scene! Very different but very enjoyable!

The characters were delightful. Olivia was a fabulous heroine that I would love to be like. Quin was handsome and sincere. I was very impressed with how Quin's Asperger's symptoms were handled. As one of my close family members also has Asperger's, I know exactly how it affects people. The inability to understand emotions was spot on. I don't think it was overdone at all - in fact, I really rather enjoyed it. It was very tactfully done and definitely enhanced Quin's character.

I loved the secondary characters. I greatly look forward to Georgiana's book. She was sweet and by the end, she seemed to be developing the backbone I kept hoping would grow. I liked Rupert quite a lot and I was satisfied with how his storyline wrapped up. I loved Lucy the dog, Quin's cousin Justin (who I also hope will be getting a story!), and Quin's terrible (but understandable) mama.

And she is a librarianCome on she is all sweet and nice but where are all the clichs, glasses and taking hair down and waving it back and forth to entice him. Really, I wanted her to be a little (kinky/freaky) with her wants in this book.

They meet in prison, he has not had sex. She is coming from a bad relationship and is horny. The story is there; well my smutty ideas, it is there.

For the story in general, it was good. The characters all flowed well. The temperament of the characters, again good. This is why I gave it three stars, but with this author, this book, this storyline, all I thought about was some very wiggly (may try you later scenes) that I did not get.

I liked Lizzie and Blue, but I didn't not love them. They won't be the couple that sticks in my head or in my heart. But that's okay, because not every book/couple will...or even should.
While Lizzie has every right to pay for her sister's college tuition as she did her own, by keeping it such a secret, she makes it look like she's doing something wrong...when she isn't. But on the other hand, Blue has no right to judge her or what she does, but I can.understand the concern about her reputation.
Ultimately, they are both to ""blame"" for their reactions. They aren't bad people by any means but they handle this situation and conflict badly.
This was probably one of the few times I've read a series out of order.

Her character is annoying and I am sorry but what everyday woman wants to read a book about a rich girl who is also beautiful enough to be a model and her troubles? No one that is who.

The strength of these characters is outstanding and they have so much goodness in their hearts.  They still  have a hard and long road ahead of them but their love for each other outweighs everything. I am positive there is nothing they cant handle as long as they do it together.

Wonderfully written - amazing storyline - amazing characters. Bravo K. Webster! You are an amazing writer! Just when I thought I couldn't read anymore of it, you told me not to be scared & keep reading. I'm so glad i did. If you haven't read this book yet, do it. Take a chance.

I was particularly looking forward to ""Storm Prey"" which was described as ""superb"" by one pre-publication reviewer.  The actual book was a let-down.  Don't get me wrong -- I admire the consistent quality of Sandford's work, and the fact that he has not moved into that ""I don't have to make any effort anymore"" space so common with bestselling authors (see, DeMille's ""Wildfire"" for a horrible example).  But this time it all seemed to much the same to me.  Some baddies do something bad.  We know who they are but Davenport does not, at first.  We know the story will begin thus, but in the past it has been Davenport's path to identifying the criminals that made the story fascinating (that and the regular characters, who remain fascinating).  But here the ""puzzle"" part is too easy and the baddies too uninteresting.  It really takes Davenport no time at all to identify the malefactors, and it's all luck.  Where's the fun in that?  the ""Aha"" moments?  In addition, I would really enjoy a villain who is neither an unraveling psychopath nor a big dumb psychopath.  You know, someone who might challenge Davenport, rather than being caught because he leaves an ever-widening swath of blood  behind him.

All of the above does not mean I did not enjoy ""Storm Prey"" -- I did.  But I would not call it ""superb"" by any means, or anywhere near Sandford's best work.",1,"[-3.0293604411769315, 0.9331763532375268, -2.5774348338483963, -1.0787394205186192, -1.9503967047142012]",0.9331763532375268

The word ""mecca"" is used to refer to a magic source. As a Christian, I found the constant references to mecca a lot off putting. The authors could have easily invented a different word. Not sure what muslims would think?
Regardless, the writing and plot drag and just are not good enough to get past this agravation.

Try ""Trickery"" instead by one of the authors; it is hugely better.",1,"[-1.13854229643934, 0.932415194932587, -2.4838755891531132, -1.1039372341850948, -1.6801011290029948]",0.932415194932587
