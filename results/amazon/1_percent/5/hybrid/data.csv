I normally read between 100 - 150 pages a day (sometimes more) and it took me 4 days to get to page 25! I thought the book cover was real cute and the storyline sounded great. I just couldn't get a feel for the characters and it seemed a little scattered to me.

Just in the 50 pages I did read the one thing I did like was her strange addiction to Jelly Bellies and her talk about the different flavors. This was cute and fun.

  ""What's your favorite flavor?""
  Thinks he's connected with me does he? ""Tossup between coconut and margarita.""
  ""I like margarita, but you can keep the coconut - tastes like soap.""

  I know! right???? Thats exactly why I do not like coconut! It reminds me of suntan oil. While I like the smell of suntan oil, I do not want to eat it!

It features a slim design so it can fit in tight places. It lasts about four hours per charge and doesn't dim very much as the charge goes down.  Which leads me to the two things I dislike about it.  One, the unit I received for review flickers quite a lot, and it's VERY noticeable when working on objects near the light.  It tends to stop flickering near the end of the charge..  It's annoying, but it's possible I simply got a defective unit.  Second, there is no warning that I can detect when the charge gets low. The unit just turns off completely until you recharge it.  A pre-warning flashing red LED on the unit would be a big help to anticipate its impending shutoff.

The other disappointment was that there was no ending.

The narrator, David Patrick Kelly appeared to have an almost Southern lilt to his voice at the outset of the story that came across like an attempted impersonation of Matthew McConaughey, but as the story progressed he did gather momentum as he changed the tone and inflection of his reading and ultimately did a pretty good job with the material he was given.

And now - on to my opinion of the story itself.  I can probably sum it up in one concise word, LACKING.  It is lacking in character development, lacking in a cohesive plot and definitely lacking in credibility. Why even the ""romance"" is lacking from what I assume is intended to be the romantic aspect of the tale.

What is not lacking in this telling is a seemingly indestructible protagonist who has more lives than Bruce Willis in a Die Hard movie as well as a plethora of scenarios depicting guts and gore. If folks dying via gunshot wounds, car crashes, being thrown from a balcony, having a bomb strapped to their back or having their eyeballs expertly cut out in the middle of a busy restaurant are things that get your juices flowing- well then, this is the book for you.

Ms. Heath had the grace to admit her scenario was extremely unlikely (no kidding!) but she excused herself on the grounds of it being fiction.  Actually, the whole thing was nothing more than sex with a few pages of trite sweetness thrown in here and there.  Story?  There was NO STORY.

Andi caught her fiancee cheating, tried to kill herself with pills over it and basically became a sl*t to cope. She sleeps with anything. Then she meets Jackson. Literally every other scene with them is sex of some form throughout the whole book. I'm not even kidding. It's not even well written sex. It's boring and predictable. Jackson is closed off because he's been hurt by his ex too, and so ensues chaos when she starts her new job and discovers Jackson is her new boss,  and her cheating ex is her new co-worker. You can see where I'm going with this. The writing was annoying as well. No abbreviation at all, and the characters address each other by name in almost every sentence. It was beyond annoying.

Then I read the review in The New Yorker, which was much more favorable, so I said to myself that if The New Yorker liked it that much, I should give it a chance.  My gut instinct was right.  The premise is interesting, and some parts of the book were nicely done, but overall it was really no better than so-so.

The book's problems include that (1) the basic premise, while interesting, is somewhere between real and alternate history, so it's not possible to suspend disbelief; and (2) major aspects of the plot (womanizing young Jack Kennedy falls for a gorgeous, mysterious and very tough broad) and the dialogue are so trite that it seems like something out of a bygone era (and I don't mean that as a compliment).

A minor point, but a cardinal sin as far as I'm concerned, is that in one critical scene, the wrong character is referred to.  Why did the editor not catch this - or, phrased otherwise, did anyone even bother to edit this book?  It's like a glaring typo or non sequitur - how can you take this book seriously when neither its author, its publisher nor its editor took it seriously enough to catch that glaring error?",1,"[-0.6616182594931106, 1.6565633492592835, -0.8891939825255364, -1.0356474048158555, -2.194992709766824]",1.6565633492592835

The pictures to color in are really nice! There are animals, landscapes and more gorgeous things for you to color in. The pages are good quality and handle the colored pencils I used really well. Everything is wonderfully put together and has become a huge favorite of mine.

First the little tab on the control was too short to get a good grip on, and really hard to turn, so I got the pliars to turn it.  You have to hold a tab back and turn the knob clockwise. This worked fine for a few minutes then the knob popped out spraying me. I threw the sprayer down and ran to turn off the water.  I had on rubber boots but I should have worn a raincoat and disposable gloves. After a shower and much scrubbing my hands still smelled like the spray.

9275,"This film reminds me of Gaspar Noe's Irreversible, in that it's initially an assault on the senses, and you feel as if you've seen great filmmaking because of it.  When I revisisted Irreversible recently, I found out I'd been had.  Noe's film is just an assault on the senses with nothing in its core.  Aronofsky's film, while nowhere as overly graphic, sadistic or disgusting as Irreversible, has this same quality.

As many have said here, the main message here is a very simplistic one, DRUGS ARE BAD.  It's almost on the level of an after school special, and that's a shame, as Aronofsky has a very good visual and editing style, but after nearly 2 hours of it, it's overkill.  I felt totally numbed after seeing this film.  I sat in my car afterwards, and I couldn't move.  But aside from the pure visceral experience of the film (which feels like a drug, the drugs the movie is telling us not to use), there isn't much left there.  There's some depth in Ellen Burstyn's character (she gives a great performance), but I believe that has to do with the fact this is based on Hubert Selby Jr.'s book.  If there is any humanism in this film, it's derived from the novel, not Aronofsky, who is like a kid with his new toy.  The characters of Leto and Connelly are especially bad, especially Connelly.  She is supposed to be a junkie, but she looks way too beautiful to be one.  Overall, the film is worth watching at least once, but it's essentially a visceral assault on your senses and little else.

A funny sidenote...Before this film screened (I saw it in a theater), the theater was playing The Wallflowers's album Breach, which is one of my favorite albums of theirs.  After I recovered from this assault, I kept thinking about how wonderful and tuneful those songs were, and I pretty much forgot about Aronofsky's film (until I wrote this review).  I bought Breach, and it's one of my favorite albums.

9316,"I found this DVD is the used bin when shopping the other day, and literally for pennies (ok $3), I couldn't believe my good fortune. I immediately snapped this up of course. I hadn't seen ""Live at Pompeii"" in many, many years. I didn't even know that a new ""Director's Cut"" had been released, so I was quite intruiged by this.

""Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii"" (171 min.) starts off with the ""Director's Cut"" (91 min; in 16:9 widescreen). I was a little surprised to see all the additional space footage, I mean how weird is it to see International Space Station footage from (I'm guessing) the 1990s in a concert film that was filmed in late 71/early 72! I also couldn't quite understand the logic behind adding footage (not concert footage, even) from the band messing around at Abbey Studios on various ""Dark Side of the Moon"" material. All rather strange. The original film (60 min; in 4:3 full screen) is also included, thankfully. While I prefer watching the widescreen ""refit"", the original shorter movie makes a lot more sense musically and thematically. ""Echoes Part I"" and ""Echoes Part II"" bookend the fantastic Pompeii-filmed set.

Am I the only one to think that as it relates to the Pompeii-filmed footage, Nick Mason had an inordinate amount of screen time? I'm thinking as much as the other three combined. You can't as much as catch a glimpse of Roger Waters until well into ""Echoes Part I"" for some reason. The DVD contains a 15-20 min. interview with the director Adrian Maben, and it's interesting hearing him talk about the intent of making this the ""anti-Woodstock"" film, with no spectators instead of the ""million"" at Woodstock. In the end, contrary to some other reviewers here, I don't mind all that much that Maben made a ""Director's Cut"", since thankfully the DVD presents both the old and the new versions.

8999,"I have a love-hate-kind of dislike relationship with this book. I loved it because it was the Sinners but I hated it because it was the end. The thing I disliked is i felt like there was this huge part of the storyline that was just swept under the rug unresolved.

Maci was a big part of the story of Danny and Skye. And there is one part where Maci says something that could have been a huge deal. But it's like it'd never ever addressed. So if it wasn't being addressed why did it happen. Someone can't run their mouth, say something like that and we done a- shut a b! tch down or 2- mention it to the man. We don't just never talk about it ever again. Also, her wall home. Why did that happen if it was never brought up again and everything was fine and dandy. Why did he always make her feel like it was his job if it was never discussed. Just alot felt like it was left unfinished. Loose ends that should have been tied up.
The other thing I didn't like about this is now that the clubs merged, I don't know who is who. When names were given and people were upset, I had no idea who they were...but they kind of sounded like they mattered.  It's almost like we need a family tree. There is just too many people involved at this point.

I think the relationship between Danny and Skye was heartbreaking in the beginning. What she did. The heart shattering run ins they would have. It was just hard. I'm glad they made it through, but boy did Skye make a job out of running. It seemed like she spent the first half running from everything at every turn.

Lauren Layne is my number one author. She is my go to girl when I need to read a good book. You know, when you are in a rut and want a GOOD book??? Lauren is it for me. She is my spirit animal. My soulmate. My fav. She is it for me.

Someone Like You had me giddy and wiggling all around when I read it. When I was reading the book, Adele was playing in my head. I was signing her version of ""Someone Like You"" and thinking, this book is as good as the song!

Then there is Daisy. I can't not think of one bad thing to say. She was awesome in her own rite. When you put them together, you have something special. Alone, they are good, together they are better. See, each of them has their own past (but don't we all) and when they become friends, they complete each other.

This book had everything I look for in a book. It was definitely a page turner. Keeping my hooked from beginning to the end. This book has everything I enjoy in a great read! It was full of angst, heartbreak, love romance, and my stomach was on a roller coaster of feelings and I loved it.

This book really centers around Chloe and Gavin. They are childhood best friends, that love each other. But because of different circumstances and people. They never really act on their feelings. Through out this book you will see these two fight what they feel and be afraid to show them,  These two story like any good book will leave you frustrated.  Watching them miss opportunities and watching the stubbornness that lead to miss moments was sometimes that drove me crazy. There were parts in this book that made me cry, made me laugh and made me swoon.  Like I said every emotion was it with this story!

I do agree that there are many twists and turns, some rather far fetched, but decided to sit back and just enjoy them. I don't expect all fiction to mirror real life.  This is not a police procedural, just a good story.

Oh my goodness!!! What can I possibly say??? This book is excellent and such a phenomenal look into Sam and Tiel's life!!! If you read my review from Necessary Restoration then you know I absolutely did not like Tiel. But let me tell you that this book completely redeemed her!!! In such a way that I feel so bad about dissing her that I want to apologize and start over with her after this book. Im so sorry Tiel. Please forgive me. Anyway it was my extreme dislike for her as to why I put off reading this book for so long. I cannot believe I was so stupid and am kicking myself so hard!!! This book is fantastical!!!  and Im so glad I finally read it!!!

We see Tiel's and Sams relationship in a way that puts everything into perceptive and you cant help cheering them on. You feel their happiness and pain. Oh my god the pain. It tore my heart apart. I can relate all too well with their loss. Kate did such a wonderful  job drawing me in it was as if I was on the sidelines experiencing everything with them. It was emotional it was raw and so very real. So devastating. But the happiness was so consuming and just as powerful!!!

This books is exceptional!!! And after reading it I now believe that Sam and Tiel's relationship is one of the best. They are there for each other no matter what the situation is. They love fiercely. They live by their rules. And if no one likes well thats just too bad. Im so glad that their story wrapped up the way it did. I personally believe their HEA was the best.

I picked it up and was excited to see where this book took off... and I gotta say I was underwhelmed. Sure, there's a lot of sex. But the plot was okay. I am not one to need a bunch of mush and a perfectly coiffed story to be happy, like many of other readers. So that's probably why this book read like your average romance with some sexy times. It much checks off all those boxes.
Sex- check
cheesy romance- check
stupid miscommunication that doesn't make any sense- check
humor- check
family coming together- check

The whole, he writes a book and hits top 4 of a list, was quite unrealistic. The ex of one also being the guy from a story too contrived.

What an amazing, heart wrenching, jaw dropping book this was.  Now, I loved Jackson, but holy hot dayuum Liam just stole my heart and RAN!  This book, the feelings, the emotions Just Wow! The minute you pick up Consolation, her writing just sucks you in and you won't put this one down until you reach the end.  Even then, youll keep swiping your kindle like a maniac because you will want more!

Natalie is grieving the loss of her husband.  The day that knock came to the door, was the day her life was changed forever.  Raising a beautiful baby girl on her own Aarabelle, Natalie pushes through to get through her daily routine.  She is hurt, lost and just feels abandoned by her late husband.  He promised he would come back, but promises aren't always kept.  Like any good mother, she picks herself up and gets through the day but is she really living?

My life is gone.  My heart is dead.  Im a widow at twenty-seven - Natalie

Insert Liam Dempsey into the picture.  Holy mother of gawd this man is just pure perfection.  He is gorgeous, honest, sweet and so caring.  He is a current SEAL and was Aarons best friend.  He steps in and helps Natalie even though she doesnt think she needs any help in things that need to be taken care of once you lose someone.  But, he offers so much more.  You cant help who you fall in love with, even if it seems forbidden and wrong, the heart wants what it wants.

I shouldnt want this but I do.  I shouldnt be comfortable in his arms.  But I am.  I should make him leave and put some distance between us.  But I cant.  - Natalie

This was an exceptionally written story.  You will laugh, you will cry, you WILL SCREAM at your kindle.  These are all guarantees while you read.  You WILL fall head over heels with Natalie and Liams story.  I absolutely cannot wait for Conviction.  Congratulations Corinne on another amazing story!  6 Stars!

The original SCARY MOVIE was stupid but fun, it had a  history line, a defined plot and defined characters, constructed basically around the SCREAM characters.
But this sequence, shot less than a year after the first one, is a disgrace. It is just stupid, bad tasted jokes all the way. I think the Wayans brothers should think seriously about the example of a bad movie that they have directed, facing it as a lesson, not taking in consideration its success at the box office.

25,"I've spent hundreds of dollars on various units from Battery Tender, Schumacher, and NOCO.  My first experience was buying a Battery Tender ($49.95) to keep our entry gate properly charged so that it opened and closed when needed. The second one was a Schumacher ($154.00) that I wanted to use to charge and maintain an old 1974 Porsche 914 2.0 Liter.  Unfortunately the clips were too large to fit into the minuscule battery compartment.  However that Schumacher unit worked just fine on charging and maintaining the huge battery in my Ford Lightning.

Then came the NOCO Genius  ($99.95) which I use on another old collector Porsche, a model that would discharge the battery completely while sitting in the garage.  My best guess is that the clock is run by the battery and keeps running until the battery gives up. The NOCO took care of that problem for me as far as maintaining it, but you had to keep an eye on it while charging because our frequent power outages in Southwest Florida keep turning it off.  So for $27.38 I didn't really expect a lot of performance from this Stanley BC209 Battery Maintainer.

However, after receiving this unit, the first time that I needed to charge up a battery was for my Toro Zero Radius lawnmower.  The grass only grows moderately during our three winter months and it is easier on the lawn if you mow it and water it less during this dormant period.  However that usually causes the lawnmower battery to fully discharge.  Hooking it up was simple and the results were perfect.  After that the old Battery Tender in our gate failed and I replaced it with this Stanley unit.  After a month it is functioning perfectly even though it sits in a rusted out control/operator box in our high heat and humidity.

This charger is a great value for the money.  Battery chargers and tenders just keep getting smaller, simpler to use, and more cost effective.  You can't go wrong with this unit.",1,"[0.6286534848977055, 1.3052593734536235, -1.2828735129276425, -1.0569027408633844, -1.6988726669031373]",1.3052593734536235

More often than not, Dream Theater sounds like they simply borrow bits from all the other prog rock bands out there, and try to mesh into their own style, but it doesn't work at all, at least not on this CD/album.  I recognise the influences here.  When I'm listening to the album, I can hear Metallica, Rush, ELP, Yes, Pink Floyd, and even Ravi Shankar/Indian influences.  But, unfortunately, the influences don't really mess.  They're all over the place without becoming cohesive, and the album doesn't work at all.  The musicianship is generally very good, but it feels cold and mechanical.  The lyrics are tremendously pedestrian and borderline stupid.  The lead vocalist is desperately trying to bring emotion to the awful lyrics, and he ends up making them worse.  There is one tremendous song that I have played over and over again, and that's Beyond this Life.  Even though the lyrics and singing aren't very good, the music on that one track is fantastic.

I felt with this book there was to many details and the book could have been from Caroline's and Dean's point of view and her and Dean's story and then another book  written about Jamie and Chip's story to include the a different view to include the guys point of view and that may have made the story a little bit more interesting. I feel that the story lagged and the amount of detail even down to the design on plates, really took away from the story because it was to much and to overwhelming at points. There were good parts in the story but that was about half way through and then it went up and down from there. Over all I didn't like this book that much, I can't give it a one rating because it was not the bad. I would say this is about a 2 1/2 star for sure.",1,"[-2.4667827023998035, 1.2202861355721821, -0.5307750741430202, -0.9943231715131696, -2.389770841792293]",1.2202861355721821
9399,"I watched this with a friend of mine who is very forgiving of modern comedies...and he thought it was as wretched as I did.

There are so many things that are so wrong about this movie but the worst aspect of ROLE MODELS is that it is NOT funny.

I don't know who Paul Rudd is, but he has zero screen presence.  I sat through his abysmal movie THE TEN and could not for the life of me understand what kind of person would laugh at that.  In ROLE MODELS, he plays a selfish jerk with no redeeming qualities.  He's not funny.  His acting is flat.  His character goes nowhere.  You never believe for a second that a severely-wasted Elizabeth Banks could ever care about a lout like him.

My friend turned me about halfway through and asked, ""Do you think the studio people screened this and thought they had a winner here?""
To the people who made this movie, it's all about formulas and the deal.  Get Stiffler from AMERICAN PIE and McLovin from SUPERBAD and you can't miss...no matter how awful the final product is.

I hated SUPERBAD, which had absolutely zero laughs in it.  Although ROLE MODELS did manage to have a couple of weak chuckles, it had so many dead air misfires that it was more embarrassing than SUPERBAD.

Another lame, horrible ""comedy"" by someone (Paul Rudd) whose talent has been exhausted (like Seth Rogan) and yet they keep making movie after movie.  That's Hollywood.

The book is really well written, and the author has an amazing imagination, but this is a tough book to get through. Not only do you have to pay super close attention to all the minute details, but her vocabulary is way beyond that of the recommended age group (ages 10-14). I can't remember the last time I used the dictionary feature on my Kindle so much. While a hearty vocabulary is always good, it just seemed unnecessary and a bit pretentious here.

I wish I could have loved this book as much as most people seem to, but it just wasn't for me.

I honestly have no idea what to expect from this short story when the author approached me to review his book. I never read his book before, but the blurb was intriguing, and seems like my kind of book. So I gave it a try and I was happy that I tried this.

This is an action packed book, very fast pace, that left me nicely breathless at times. It was gripping and enchanting. I really want to know why this person did what he did, but hey, psychotic person didn't need reason. Still, I was curious.

Favorite quotes and moments from book:

""Nothing in my life has ever felt as perfect as being inside of you.""

""You are special.  You're the most special person in the world to me.  I don't know how to make you see and feel that.""

I brushed his hair out of his stricken face with a soft touch, wanting to comfort the things I saw in his eyes so clearly.  It was such a reflection of my own torment.  His soul was a mirror of my own. Perhaps his insane claim that we were made for each other wasn't so very far off the mark.  I had known him for such a short time, but somehow I felt I could read him so perfectly, so naturally, that it astounded me.

The characters grow both individually and as a couple. They get stronger and overcome every hurdle comes their way. Its not easy, but then; what is? Certainly not love.

Embry and Luke have been through so much. And yet, their love is strong as ever. Even they think everything is lost. Even when things get dark and uncertain. Their love is still there. They are still there for each other. No matter what.

Embry and Lukes love is breathtaking and absolutely mindblowing.

It is epic.

255,"We all know what the term ""graphic novel"" means, right?  Well what do you call a comic book that's written in the form of a novel?  Especially if it contains a few too many subplots that bring it perilously close to putting it in the romance genre?

Ms. Wecker has the germ of a good fantasy novel; as a result, parts of ""The Golem and the Jinni"" are OK.  There's also a bit of OK historical fiction thrown in about the lower East Side of Manhattan in the late 19th/early 20th century.  However, the book is too much like a cartoon combined with a romance novel and seems padded to boot.  The characters, dialogue and plot are wooden and lifeless, and I finished it more out of a sense of duty and from any driving compulsion to find out what happened.  It's an easy enough read, so I'll give it three stars rather than the two that it probably deserves; on the other hand, when I finished it on a flight yesterday, I left it in the seat back in front of me rather than make the effort to carry this (heavy) book around with me any more.",1,"[-2.7175331663089732, 1.1898840860223605, -1.0678439483288664, -1.0476852886779087, -1.3237515066174095]",1.1898840860223605

3156,"I am mystified at the high ratings for a book  that is embarrassingly amateurish.  It's failings are chiefly in the literary realm.  It appears the author liked end of the world books and after reading a few and watching the Walking Dead  he thought,  ""Hey, I can do that.""  Well, no. Writing a novel take skill and the ability to tell an interesting story.  First person point of view wears very quickly.  Authors must learn patience, how to introduce ideas, the right level of detail, keeping the reader's attention and characters who are not caricatures.  Most of all they must learn to let the story tell itself instead of force feeding the reader every minute  shard.

What's missing is any sense of nuance.  Jack and his kids are perfect, almost able to leap buildings with a single bound. And that mind-numbing detail!!!  It illustrates my point that there is no real story other than survival and fighting zombies.  The best such stories actually have a plot with character who develop and do things - The Stand, The Road, Lucifer's Hammer, the Last Ship (the 1988 novel), On The Beach, etc  There is no way to mask that the detail attempts to hide the lack of any real plot.  It's the standard ""special forces"" guy protecting family from bad guys - humand and inhuman. I found myself skipping whole sections of detail.",1,"[-1.1730396270812895, 1.182850801706861, -1.307059691124038, -1.0588361601959921, -1.5473758765045154]",1.182850801706861
4395,"Never Never is the first installment in co-authors Colleen Hoover and Tarryn Fisher's mature young adult series titled: Never Never. When I finished this book, I was pissed. But after sitting on it for a few days, I think I can write a fair review. Because there's good and bad in everything right?

The good: I finished the book! Something good about it kept me going. It was mysterious and intriguing to follow these characters as they tried to make some sense out of this situation and re-learn both themselves and others around them. I was supportive of the characters' slow but sure attraction to each other, despite what they gradually learned about their past behavior. The characters have potential and apparent motivation to be better than the person they were, and I liked that about them. I was genuinely curious, and very eager to get my many, many questions answered. That combined with my emotional response after finishing the book, although quite negative, at least shows that I was very much invested in the story.

The bad: I was confused! The concept that the characters' situation was based on made no sense at all. (See spoiler) From the first page to the last page, I had so many questions that went unanswered...and then the stupid cliffhanger! It was unnecessary. Why publish a 140 page book that ends right in the middle of a climactic scene instead of just publishing a full-length novel that allows the reader to gain a full experience? And the next installment won't be released until May 2015??? I think Never Never should be marketed as a serial instead of a series...that would make more sense and would at least give readers a heads up to what they are getting into. Yes, I know it's the author's right to organize their work as they see fit, but I did not enjoy my experience and because I don't want a repeat, I won't be continuing the series. The end.

2795,"When I saw that this was about an Amish school teacher I was excited to read it. Let me start by saying this is the 5th book by Cindy Woodsmall I have read. And usually I love her books. This was not the case here, unfortunately. I did NOT dislike the book, I found it ""good enough"" and it did keep me interested.

The problem I had with it was that it felt very scattered to me and confusing, hard to follow. I kept having to refer to the ""cheat sheet"" list of characters in the back of the book, Thank you Cindy for that page, without it I would have really been lost.
Usually in a book there is a plot and maybe a sub-plot. I felt that there were really 4 plots to this book. Any one of them would have made a very good story in itself, but thrown all-together it was kind of hard for me to follow. At one time I even flipped the page back and forth looking at the page numbers, sure I had missed a page.
I loved the story of Lena, the school teacher, and wished she had focused more on that story alone.
I also felt that way too much was happening at the same time in that small Amish community. I found myself saying ""Wow this community is crazy!"" again, any one thing would have been great, but I felt it was too much going on to be believable.

Let me finish by reinstating that I did LIKE this book, I just didn't love it like I did all her others. I don't feel that was her best one. This book did get some very good reviews from others, so maybe I am just being too picky.

1982,"This (hopefully) last ""Legend"" tale was the worst.  Like other reviewers, I devoured the original series and even liked the three ""family"" series.  But something changed in the ""Legends"" Series - the story not only got off track but introduced elements that were disconcerting in the least.

Where to start? The sadism was so bad that when Erasmus or one of the Titans drew near to a human I skipped ahead, unable to stand any more elevated rationalizations from these monsters. Besides, we are never told why they act as they do - what drove them to this madness? Speaking of madness, the cult of Serena was one of the wackiest ever.  The idea of unarmed mobs taking over a governnment was absurd.

Then we had those interminable battle scenes that were the epitomy of dullness. The conversations among the robots were  ridiculous, more like something on Mystery Science Theater. There were too many characters and the hero (Vor Atriedes)remained distant, never acquiring a personality.  Also the characters made decisions totally ""out of character"" again and again. The writing style (three pages/chapter) is annoying, making it seem like a series of vignettes instead of a seamless tale.

On the plus side, we learn the origins of the Spacing Guild  (Norma, my favorite character, appeared briefly). The origins of the Bene Geserit - more an accident than a purposeful event - was a good saga. We learn why the Harkonnens are hated, the Atriedes admired and the Corrinos in command. I hope the authors move on to other things...drop the robots, the battles and get on with the mythology.",1,"[-1.4476493822389367, 1.1751963572796824, -0.6967804683605321, -1.0012653331167372, -1.9786436633579607]",1.1751963572796824

I couldn't find it locally, so finally ordered one on Amazon.

Now, I LOVE carbonated drinks. I've never bought a Soda Stream though, because there's no place around here to get canister refills, and most of the syrups were disgusting, so no point.  I've been drinking sodas, but want to wean myself off the cola type drinks. I thought this might be a good compromise, as I don't really like plain water.

I bought two brands to try - the other one (not naming it here, since this is a review about LaCroix, but it was strawberry dragonfruit. It was gross, and I love dragonfruit) was NOT good at all, so I almost didn't want to try this one!  That would have been a mistake.
This comes very close to Sierra Mist, IMHO.  Of course, it isn't the same, since there is no sweetener in it. That's right - no sugar, so salt, no fake coloring.  Clear and bubbly.  It was very good.  The colder, the better. I tried it right from the case and it was meh.  But, stuck a few cans in the fridge and let them get nice and cold (I don't always have access to ice), and it improved it a great deal.

I can see this being a regular part of my drink lineup.  It will help me not drink so many sugary sodas, but still give me the carbonation I love.
The light lime taste is nice, and I am a big fan.  You could float lime slices in it if you wanted it more pronounced.

This is the second book of the Darkly, Madly duet and let me tell you; you are going to be hooked. Th words, the plot, the twists and turns, everything is just perfect. I could snot put it down, the suspense and the what will be happening now just get me more and more thrilled. Every turn of the page got me wanting more and more.

The way the main characters complement each other is over the top. Grayson is dark, raw and the psychological hot burn that he gave you is off the charts. The story had everything you could ask; the questions were answered and the conclusion that the author gave us was perfect.

The author don't disappoint me at all and with this book she gave you all. The whole ride was intense, brilliant and will keep you hooked from the beginning till the end. Definitely will be recommended to everyone.

It is such a touching, emotional book, but with such hope and peace in it that you will be amazed.
  It really would be a great help to someone who is going through losing a loved one and feeling all alone. This book The Color of Rain is really a precious story.
  Gina and her husband have two little boys and then Gina's husband gets cancer and passes away after several years of fighting it.
  Michael and his wife have two boys and one girl and then Michael's wife gets cancer, but passes away in a matter of weeks. Both of those chapters are so touching and heartbreaking, but full of faith and love.
  Both of the people who pass away went to school together.  So they know of each other and have meet each other at their children's school.
  Then Gina tries to give Michael support because she went through death first and she is a great help, but Michael is a help to her also.
  They share much in their lives and their children become the best of friends. So this is a very special story that takes you through many different stages in life, loss and healing. I really do love this book and know it is a book you will want to read. I highly recommend The Color of Rain for you.

Rough Around the Edges had the feel of the movie ""West Side Story"" about it, with gangs and intimidation in the impoverished Cuban community, not to mention the love affair between the rough and tough Alejandro (known as Alex)  and the beautiful, sophisticated, and educated Kristen. Alex is doing whatever it takes to keep the community centre open and Kristen is doing whatever it takes to gain acceptance from the people she wishes to serve.  Alex is deeply immersed in the lives of the boys he works with, even living on the property,  and Kristen goes home to her elegant condo at the end of the day.  Two worlds, different backgrounds, but a common purpose: to make a difference in the neighbourhood.  As so often happens, the people Alex and Kristen were trying to reach out to did not want their help, and they had to use methods of breaking through the barriers that did not impinge on their pride. While Hector, Raoul and even Alex tried to force Kristen out of the downtrodden area of Miami, Alex faced opposition from Kristen's family as they tried to show Alex up for the renegade they thought he was.

Rough Around the Edges is a story with depth and passion, but not in the least bit sordid.

By now everyone knows the basic story, guys go to Vegas for a bachelor party and wake up the next day remembering nothing, but missing the groom.  The rest of the movie is them trying to piece together what happened and find the missing groom.

Of the main cast by far the standout was Zach Galifianakis playing the awkward and kind of creepy brother in law.  Ken Jeong also was great in his crazy kind of way.  He was a little too close to his character on Community in the crazy department, but the way he is introduced in the movie was very funny.  I also liked Justin Bartha as the missing groom.  Although he ultimately was not in the movie much, his deadpan sarcastic delivery was very good.  There were quite a few cameos in the film but the best by far was Mike Tyson.  He ended up being in a couple scenes and was actually very good.

2476,"Catherine Gayle surprised me with DELAY OF GAME.  She put two characters together, two that I would never imagine together, and made the romance real, honest and, quite frankly, not very easy most of the time.  But what Cam and Sara had worked together, despite what he may not say or how Sara acts, what they have with each other proves that opposites do attract (and attract they do).

Sara and Cam may be an unlikely couple, but with each and every page these two are together, readers get the pleasure of following them as they ""fit"" together.  Their relationship is not about sex.  Cam makes that pretty clear early on in their relationship.  These two truly understand the other and their very different personalities tone down (in Cam's case with Sara) the other.

There is a lot of emotional drama that surrounds Cam and Sara, but that drama generally is really about the two of them, but the things happening around them.  But what that drama provides is the perfect backdrop for Sara and Cam to develop their relationship.  There's a lot of sass, a lot of dirty talk about women's shoes, but there is also a lot of one big, strong man revealing his soft squishy center to the woman he wants for the rest of his life.  It's hard not to love these two together, even when Sara fights what's happening.

For those that follow the series....a little Katie and Babs update.  We see both characters, but not together.  HOWEVER, there is a fabulous scene with Babs in the locker room that gives us a glimpse of the man he is growing into.  Makes me want to beg Catherine to give us their story sooner rather than later.

On her way home after visiting with her ex, his new wife, and leaving her daughter with them, she gets a phone call from the local sheriff. He just pulled a car from the Bitter River. In it is a sixteen year old girl that was pregnant and killed before the car found the river. If that isn't bad enough, Bell knows her, she was a good friend to Bells daughter.

If that its enough to make you keep reading things just keep getting worse for Bell. Her sister has been released from prison after she killed their father in self defense from the abuse. Then the mother of the dead girl has had relations in the past with the sheriff which makes this a serious conflict the investigation.

I liked this story. There was a lot going on in it, but I kept coming back to it to find out what was going to happen next. Bell has all kinds of drama and stress so my heart goes out to her. I liked the characters; they were all well developed and drew me into all of their issues. The one thing that I admit got to me was all the description. Yes, its good to give me such an in depth look into everything going on but it made the first part of the book boggy.

The second half of the story just flew by. I couldn't wait to see what happened and was completely wrong with who did it. Trust me, you won't know why it is until the end but will look back and go Oh yeah that makes sense.

5829,"I went into this book after reading the synopsis and sample and did not read any other information on it.  As such by those two things alone I was intrigued and started falling in love with the story.  The feel of it for me was Contemporary Romance, but the further I read the more that changed.  This book went in a completely different direction than what I was expecting by the beginning that it took me a little to process.  I thought I was getting a sweet amazing love story with such a twist as the male protagonist being homeless.

The reality is that it might start that way but the supporting characters that come into play later change this into a tale that is filled with some action and crime, which I was not expecting.

This book is told in multiple POVs focusing on three couples the main one being Livia and Blakes.  It was nice being able to get into the heads of so many of the characters and gain understanding into their actions and lives.  There was so much that was interconnected and those connections were well woven.

I loved the feeling Livia gave me with her ability to look past Blakes situation and focus on him as a person instead.  She could see him and not what the world thought of him.  It was beautifully touching in that regards and gives you a surge of pride for her and hope that there are others in the world such as her.

The supporting cast is subperb and helped keep things flowing nicely.  You really become attached to all the characters, even ones you normally wouldn't.  I don't want to give away details on the supporting characters because I don't want to giveaway the surprise feeling I myself had at their introduction.

This was a very unique and exciting story that kept me on my toes wondering what would happen next.  If you like books with crime bosses you wouldn't be disappointed, just realize this isn't the main point of this particular book.  The relationship built between 6 people is amazing and definitely worth the read.",3,"[-4.264315384915827, -1.409856843454595, -1.0099258081945917, -0.9868082176927941, -1.2196484157415728]",-0.9868082176927941

Nevil Hammersmith lost his job with Scotland Yard because of rash conduct and now runs a private detective agency. Hammersmith has a brisk business, but his main focus is locating Day.

The suspense kept me wondering what would happen next, and Grecian does an excellent job with setting, word choice, characterization, and other elements.

681,"The Duel with the Devil by Paul Collins was an interesting read. I enjoyed how Collins pieced together various facts and events of the neighborhood where the murder victim lived and strung them together to give a fuller view of the area and the time. Though, it did at times, seem to linger a bit too long on these unrelated events and feel the story as a whole could have used some preening. One case in point where I feel the author veers way off subject was his detailed statements about abortion of the time period. The murdered girl was NOT pregnant, however Collins felt it was approprietate to discuss abortion methods of the 18th century. Further still, it sounded like the typical arguments of the pro-abortion crowd about keeping it ""safe and legal."" There was absolutely no reason, apart from the author's fancy to even discuss the issue.

Also, the mentioning of the peverted man who was found guilty of raping his horse, could have been discarded. A couple of bizarre statements gave the impression that the dead girl in the coffin was ""starring"" up, but unless the author knew something I didn't (if so he didn't say so) I would assume that the coffined corpse's eyes would have been closed. But he seemed to refer on a couple of occasions to them as if they were opened.

Perhaps the book would have been more effective in a slimmed down form. Apart from these problems, it was a fascinating glimpse into the past and the rivalries that existed between various well-known personages of the day.

It would also have been nice to hear more of what happened to the accused in his final days and when he died.",2,"[-2.3478922244004927, -1.2885116340829816, -1.099083544253092, -0.9870716439766979, -1.195945973471066]",-0.9870716439766979

A Yorkshire Christmas is part of the Christmas Around the World series and I enjoyed reading it.

I love reading books about characters that aren't perfect and in A Yorkshire Christmas both the hero and heroine are not perfect and they are trying to forget past mistakes and learn from them.

I loved reading about Christmas in a Yorkshire village, especially since  the heroine Claire is a city girl and the hero Noah lived in the same family sheep farm all his life- it sounds like they have nothing in common but the longer they spend time together the more they are attracted to one another and also discover that they have things in common.

736,"The rich and varied nation of Canada deserves a bigger presence on the literary map, and with her Inspector Gamache series, Louise Penny is aiding the cause, at least for Quebec. Still Life, the inaugural title, introduces Armand Gamache of the Surete, setting him up as intelligent, open-minded, happily married, and a lover of good food. Gamache and his team are called to the remote village of Three Pines, where an elderly woman has been found dead in the woods, shot by an arrow. Because it's hunting season, the residents want to believe it was a hunting accident, but Gamache is not so sure. This is a nicely plotted mystery, with plenty of procedural detail, but mostly, it's about people, those living in Three Pines and those investigating this possible crime. Gamache relies heavily upon his finely honed powers of observation, and he's great at listening too. His insights into those he questions rarely fail him. During this case, he's also working on training his two newest assistants, and one of them, brilliant though she seems at times, isn't cutting it with Gamache, which causes him no little distress.

Still Life has a satisfying ending in which all is not what it seemed. The Inspector decides to lay his lengthy and successful career on the line, rather than make an arrest that appears obvious, but that he knows is wrong.

Kissing Johnny Gamble under the mistletoe at Christmas was something Fiona Lannigan couldn't get out of her mind.  Now Valentine's Day was here and Fiona's fantasies were getting out of control.  They were co-workers and she knew they needed to stay professional.

Trusting a man romantically wasn't something Fiona did easily.  Would Johnny be different from her ex-fianc?  Could he be trusted with her heart?

As fate would have it, Fiona and Johnny got set up as a couple for The Whiskey River Valentines Day Dance.  Afterwards, they decided to take it one step further.  Johnny had already reserved a hotel room and Fiona was willing to give him one night and then they would decide where they go from there.  They had an amazing time, but then Fiona left abruptly and Johnny didn't know what to make of it.  Will Johnny be able to convince Fiona that he is worth taking a chance on love?  Can they be together romantically and still be business partners?

Burnham was the visionary who was largely responsible for the success of the 1893 Chicago Worlds' Fair, commemorating the 400th anniversary of Columbus' discovery of the New World.  Holmes took advantage of (mostly) vulnerable women who made their way to Chicago on their own, killing them when he tired of them.
The story of the fair or of the slaughters would have been interesting books on their own.  Weaving the tales took away from the story of the fair.  While the fair was the background that enabled Holmes to have his pick from thousands of potential subjects, the detail of the how the fair developed didn't add to the story of the slaughters.

His true identity is unknown to the public as he had made a pact with an Elvis-impersonator that went wrong.  Elvis's friend Jack (Ossie Davis) is the only one who believes that he is the king, but Jack also believes that he is the John F. Kennedy.  Elvis is currently bed-ridden in the nursing home as a result of a stage accident where he broke his hip three years ago.  Between sleeping, eating, and using the bed pan Elvis has bizarre dreams and visions that often launch philosophical thoughts of getting old and its consequences.  This monotony crawls under the skin of Elvis as he decides to get out of the bed and use the restroom for once.  However, it seems as if Elvis's adventure to the lavatory leads to a darker secret that seems to drain the life out of the residents of the nursing home.  Bubba Ho-Tep is a comical and well-written horror story that the director Coscarelli adapts to the silver screen with a delicate touch of humor and suspense.  The comedy is improved with Bruce Campbell's performance as Elvis, which will give the audience reason to burst out in loud laughter several times.  Bruce Campbell also brings out a raw, but sensitive side of the old Elvis that suffers from health problems and other dysfunctions that comes with age.  Bubba Ho-Tep offers a recommended cinematic experience that both offers high quality entertainment and some reflection for the thought.",3,"[-3.0896417075572233, -1.2740352973928726, -1.5060288672388673, -1.0198362833403796, -0.9881480701825143]",-0.9881480701825143

6028,"Broken Things to Mend is another delightful contemporary romance from Karey White! The books I've read by her so far celebrate the adventure and fun of very real settings, while sharing the blossoming of romance between very relatable and lovable characters. This series starter is no exception.

The story begins with two broken souls being brought together by a Chinese matchmaker. It was interesting to get a bit of (heartbreaking) back story for the hero, Silas, and to meet him as he's trying to indulge a kind older lady in her odd requests (yes, plural) for transportation to the bus stop in Bend, Oregon.

Then there's the heroine, Celia, who's running from a past and present that haunt her, hoping to find a better future in the small town of Sisters, Oregon. One can't help but root for her in her quest to find a place to truly belong.

Perspectives switch quite a bit at the beginning of the story, which could potentially be disorienting, although it does help give a sense of a larger destiny at play and provide an inside look at the converging of multiple lives.

I really enjoyed all of the characters: the way they slowly open up like new blooms; the way the seasons change from wariness to tender trust; the way they find joy and understanding together. Silas is a quiet, gentle, and loyal soul. Celia is reserved but dedicated and caring. And Silas's aunt, while not without fault, is the perfect friend and nurturing figure for them both.

While there's not a whole lot of suspense and danger in this story, there's a good deal of tension and plenty of questions to keep the story moving along at a steady pace. And, as a girl who calls Oregon home now, I found particular pleasure in following the characters through Sisters and beyond, recognizing some town and landmark names while experiencing some new things.

Broken Things to Mend is touching and heartwarming, while being a little more serious in nature than The Husband Maker series (which I also highly recommend for sweet contemporary romance fans). I felt the ending was resolved a little too quickly, but otherwise I was quite pleased with this story of learning to trust those you love, discovering the perils of judging others, and taking a chance on something wonderful.

4655,"Super cute romance read full of bits of delicious snark and swoon worthy moments.  Exactly the kind of pick me up I was looking for.  I think I fell in love with Nico right from the start when he wasn't put off by Kat's attempts to put him off.  And their relationship developed nicely -- from crush and lust to friendship to more.  And I'm normally not a kid kind of girl, but Serafina was a rock star....that kid cracked me up.

The book did suffer from adding in details whose only purpose seemed to be to drive something in the plot, and then were just dropped (or didn't become as important as I thought they should be).  The big ones: the skiing accident -- served to get Kat staying at the palace, but then her injuries were barely mentioned from there on out, and it just felt like they would have been bothering her in some of those situations; and the childhood trauma -- served to slow things down with Kat and Nico and show why she was a unicorn, but just felt like an afterthought at times when it could have been worked into the plot and her character more.  I also was a NOT AT ALL a fan of the Seamus O'Brien stuff.  I guess I just could not buy that there was even a glimmer of a thought of betraying the royal family for money...honest to goodness, I couldn't believe it.  Maybe I'm naive.  Maybe I just didn't quite get the full effect that being poor had on Kat, but it just felt like a plot device.  Thank goodness it wrapped up way better than I was expecting, but it was one of those tiny plot pieces that gave my tummy cramps b/c I disliked it so much.

Now saying all that, notice I still gave this book 4 stars!  Which means that while those things bothered me, the adorableness of the story was enough to make me still really enjoy myself.

This book was different than I was expecting, but in a really great way. I think, at least for me, when you think of a book set in the art world, you expect them to be a little snooty and the characters were anything but...Tobias is really intense, in a way that keeps Zara, and everyone around him, on their toes. I loved it, I loved the twists and turns, and I loved the reveal, although I think there were enough clues that I wasn't surprised in the least. But, if you aren't paying attention, they are subtle, and you will miss them, if that makes any sense.

Zara and Tobias have a fantastic first meeting, and I loved this book from that point on. I loved that their first meeting wasn't perfect, it wasn't with unicorns and rainbows, but rather felt like a real life situation a number of us have been in....a slightly embarrassing moment that is then witnessed by someone else.

As this is the first book in a connected trilogy, there is a lot of time spent setting up the events, and the characters, so they are able to move through all of the books. But, it was balanced well with action, and scenes with Zara and Tobias that you felt like the story had momentum.

2148,"What I Was Doing While You Were Breeding: A Memoir (293 pages) is a tongue-in-cheek travel-cum-dating memoir from Kristin Newman, someone I had never heard of myself, but apparently she is a veteran writer for many TV shows including That 70s Show and How I Met Your Mother. In the Prologue, Newman explains that when TV shows go on summer hiatus, she has lots of time on her hands, and her love for traveling lead her to explore many countries and cultures over the years, and oh yea, she finds herself less retrained (in exploring guys) when traveling overseas as compared to at home. The book covers her travel adventures from 2000 to 2011, when she was in her late twenties and thirties.

Couple of comments: Newman definitely has a knack for telling great stories. Here from her adventures in Moscow: Mishas room was pretty small for four people trying to do terrible things to each other, so Misha took Sasha for a twenty minute tour of the bathroom, leaving me and Aleg to his futon, ha! Even funnier is when Newman describes the security screening she and her friend Astrid have to endure to board an El-Al flight to Tel Aviv: Basically, single women in their thirties are a national security threat to Israel. Why? just read! Newman clearly doesnt take herself too seriously in all of this, and that serves the book well. The book comes across as a travelogue as much as it is a relationship observer (mostly of the foreign kind).

I found myself reading this book from start to finish in no time, as you turn the pages easily and quickly.

2025,"There are four main characters in this book: Abby, Seth, Hannah, and Luke. Abby heads to Seaview Key after leaving a failed marriage and a successful restaurant, the latter of which made her very well off. Seth has moved to Seaview Key after serving in the military. Hannah and Luke are married to each other. She used to be Abby's best friend, and he used to date her.

Abby's arrival causes all sorts of problems for Luke and Hannah. Hannah is very distrustful of Abby and insecure about whether Abby and Luke will reunite. (Hannah is about to have a test to see whether her cancer has returned, so her insecurity is perhaps understandable.) In large part because of this insecurity, Luke and Hannah try to coax Seth and Abby into a relationship.

But neither Seth nor Abby is fully prepared for a relationship. He has a fear of commitment after losing the woman he loved while in the military. Abby has concerns after her failed marriage. And Abby's wealth is a source of great discomfort for Seth, who apparently is threatened by it.

The rest of ""Home to Seaview Key"" is strictly by the numbers. The setting is an idyllic place. The two people destined to fall in love put up all sorts of absurd barriers and act like adolescents at times. And characters cry repeatedly. The problem isn't that these things don't happen. It's that they seem to be required for books like this. I can't say that I disliked this book, and I'm certainly aware that it fills a desire many people have for the predictable. (I say that without judgment, for certainly I have preferences too.) But the story didn't appeal to me much since I found the excuses for delaying the romance to make the characters seem too shallow and immature, and I find the author's repeated use of adverbs in dialog tags (e.g., ""she said sincerely"" or ""Abby asked reasonably"") to be annoying and often intrusive, a hallmark of poor writing.",2,"[-3.1649753537654894, -1.4242056079416374, -1.3978825119587737, -0.990581959378797, -1.163731436591949]",-0.990581959378797

This is a standalone novel.

Jake Sharp is ex-military and his latest assignment is to shadow Camille Logan.

Camille is the daughter of a business tycoon who has made as many enemies as he has cash. And now there is a mark on Camille's head. At first Jake is put off by his latest assignment and is convinced that he'll be nothing more then a glorified babysitter for a spoiled rich kid. What he finds, is that he could not be more wrong.

Camille is fierce, independent and head strong. And she's just as thrilled as Jake to have someone watching over her every move. So thrilled that she tries to run out on him more than once. The more time they spend together, the more they both realize that their 'relationship' is slowly turning into so much more. When Jake goes digging to try and find the threat that wants Camille dead, her father pulls him off the case. But Jake's instincts tell him to stay close, he vows to himself that he will not let harm come her way.

Can he really keep his promise? Jake has a past of his own too that threatens to rip them apart. Will his love ever be enough for someone like Camille?

Accompanied by his wife and a group of fellow history members of the Berry sponsored organization ""History Matters"" they search out little known aspects of the past that don't coincide with writings in history books.  For example, prior to publishing The 14th Colony Mr Berry wrote the ""Patriot Threat"" in which he indicated that the US Income Tax might be illegal.  This premise is utilized in the that book as part of the plot described.
  Similarly, in the current novel, the 14th colony is indicated as the present country of Canada.  It is indicated that at three distinct periods during the history of the US, plans were drawn up to invade and annex the country of Canada. These plans never came to fruition but were present and available if the US government decided they should be followed.
  Cotton Malone is the protagonist again utilized by Mr. Berry.  In addition, Malone's on again, off again girlfriend Cassiopeia  makes an appearance  with an eye towards reconciliation with Cotton.  Ordered to Siberia by his ex boss on a temporary assignment in order to meet with Alexandr Zorin Malone is forced to parachute into the area.  He is captured by the Russians but escapes meeting up with Cassiopeia who has been sent to help him and together they pursue Zorin into Canada's Prince Edward Island.  Zorin picks up a Russian sleeper agent left over from the cold war and living in Canada.  The two make their way into the United States and eventually to the White House in time for the inauguration of a new president.
  The actuality of the planned invasion of Canada, and a flaw written into the order of succession of US presidents in the eventuality of deaths of several of those in line are utilized as aiding and abetting the two Russians in their plot.  What they plan to use is one of five suitcase nuclear bombs stored away for many years.

Mending Her Heart by : J. Lee

I give this book four stars.
This book starts us off in a heated domestic dispute.  Elsy is in a horrible relationship and ends up needing medical attention.  Her only living relative Lyle is her cousin that lives 6 hours away.  Lyle takes Elsy back home to recover from her broken relationship and to hide out from his abusive tendencies.

This book follows along as Elsy mends mentally and physically with the help of her cousin Lyle and all of his close friends who have heard so much about Els that they feel they know her already.  Elsy meets Dino, Lyle's best friend, and the sexual tension throughout the book is noticable.  Dee gives Els as much time as she needs to mend before he suggests anything more than friendship.  Dee, also from a rocky background finds himself becoming more whole as a person after he meets and romances Els.  Elsy makes new friends and even faces her stage fright and gets up on stage to sing.  Dee and Elsy write a song together which everyone at the bar they sing at loves.  Dee and Lyle own an auto body shop where they learn later they inadvertantly hired a man who is helping Reed, Elsy's X fiance, learn Elsy's habits and how to trap her so that he can get revenge.

A truely serious subject of emotional and physical abuse including stalking and attempted murder.  This book explores many different senses in the reader.  Fear, longing, dread, guilt, sadness, joy and excitement.  Definately a book for mature readers with very explicit sexual content and violence.

Kendall Ryan is one of my go to authors. I have read every book she has written. Bait & Switch is unlike any of her other books. It is  way more suspenseful and even a little more darker than we are used to.

Nolan is former military who is now in security. He doesn't do hearts and flowers or relationships. In fact, he is kind of a Dom. He has a roommate that he is in a weird sex only relationship. She is more of a sub, but it is not a strict Master type relationship. To me, they are more just friends who have sex.

Lacey comes into Nolan's life like a hurricane. She is sweet and caring and not sure what to make of Nolan and how he loves his life. She is not trying to judge, but figure out where she fits in and her place in Nolan's life.

There is a HUGE secret that Lacey is hiding. Let me tell you, I didn't see that one coming from a mile away.

Because of this, and in order to save his daughter Amelia, Callum had to undergo a blackmail from a moneylender, and in the next few months he would have to steal several jewels from people of society until he paid off all of his cousin Robert's debt.
Without having the money to pay, Callum obeyed. And soon he became known as the Surrey Bandit.
The last item on the list to be stolen was the famous brooch of Dowager Duchess of Penworth. And at this meeting, Callum and Alice Worthingham come face-to-face.

Alice's family was neighbor of the Viscount Arndel, and although she found him the most handsome man she had ever met, he did not seem to be charmed by her last season. In fact, he looked at her like she had pox!! So she decided that although he and she were meeting quite a bit, because Callum was selling part of his land to the new Duke, Alice's brother, she would rather marry someone away from Surrey.

But the big question was, would Callum this time let Alice be courted by other men?
It was certain that he was poor and could not woo a duke's daughter/sister, but the feeling he had for her was greater than reason, and soon Callum found himself doing craziness to be able to have Alice.
However clever as it was, since the Worthingham sisters were raised quite differently from the other ladies in society, Alice discovers Callum's secret... and now, she would have to choose between handing him over to the police to be hanged or hear her heart...

A year has passed since Toby's last adventures left her exhausted, wounded and barely alive, and someone close to her dead.  Now she is focusing on training Quentin as her squire, doing her job as Sylvester's knight and trying to make her life go by in a normal way, but her life is ragged and worn due to her decisions and what she's done.  Then there's the question of Tybalt, the King of Cats, who's a whole issue on his own.

And then she is asked to help once again, as a friend and fellow knight, Etienne, reveals to her that his daughter has been kidnapped.  This comes as a shock to Toby, as she didn't even know he had a daughter, but that's because he's kept secret about it, as she's half-changeling -- like Toby -- and lives with her mother in the human world.  Her name is Chelsea, and like her father, she can teleport.  But because she is young and just coming into her powers, she is able to open doors and gateways that shouldn't ever be opened; places that haven't been accessible for centuries.  She also can't stop herself as she's on the run from her kidnappers, but also because she can't control her powers.  If they don't stop her soon, she'll end up tearing Faerie apart.

Just another ordinary day of mayhem and adventure for Toby, though this time the stakes seem higher than ever.  And she can easily identify with a half-changeling not knowing what is really going on and how to control her powers, and if this were to get out about Etienne, it would ruin him.  Plus there's Tybalt who keeps lending a helping hand and is always there when she needs him, and Toby really needs to work out what her feelings are about him.  Just another ordinary day.

It begins with someone shooting an arrow that narrowly misses causing serious harm to Alafair, Dave's adopted daughter, and ramps up from there.

The personification of evil is a persistent theme in the Robicheaux series and few crime writers portray it as well as James Lee Burke. Asa Surrette, a Kansas serial killer, who has followed the Robicheaux party to Montana is at the top of the pack in this novel. But he's not alone. His acolytes--allies as well as foes--include the corrupt rich, crooked cops and a bevy of hirelings.

Though the venue has been moved to Montana, Louisiana and its influence on the primary characters suffuses the novel. A recovering alcoholic and Vietnam vet, Dave is haunted by ghosts of his past which influence his actions in the present. Clete, as good-hearted, vulnerable and prone to bad choices as ever, continues to have Dave's back. Gretchen, a new party to the cast, is a more developed and sympathetic character in this book while I found Alafair a bit more hard-edged than in previous novels.

9508,"Many fans of Perry Mason have watched for the release of each season expectantly, hoping that the momentum stayed with us and the entire series made it to DVD. At last, that is now the case with the last half of Season Nine in release.

I watched Perry Mason as a kid, but I became an entrenched fan during the years that TBS ran the series in the 80s. I saw them round and round, until to this day many of them are like old friends when I view them again on DVD. However, these old friends bring continued surprises, as the DVD sets have the entire show, something that has likely never been true in any syndication of the series.

I never felt that the quality of the acting, mysteries, or production dropped throughout Perry Mason's long run. The final few shows were as entertaining as the first.

As others have mentioned, this set contains the very entertaining dual role episode, with Raymond Burr playing both Mason and the alcoholic merchant marine hired to get Mason into hot water.

Not only have I always been entertained by Perry Mason and his mysteries, but I learned a few things along the way too. Mason was a great role model with his firm stands against those without ethics. I admired that backbone and made sure to grow it myself, and it has served me well over the decades.

We can't thank most of them in person anymore, but regardless my thanks go out to Erle Stanley Gardner, Raymond Burr, Barbara Hale, William Hopper, William Tallman, Ray Collins and the dozens of judges, hundreds of guest stars, and the outstanding writers who brought us so much entertainment for so long, and made these characters our friends.

2339,"Kaleidoscope Hearts is the first book in the Hearts series from author Claire Contreras and is a multiple-chances love story between Elle Reuben and Oliver Hart, two people who fall for each other at the ages of sixteen and nineteen, respectively, but are unable to make a true go of a relationship. Oliver is best friends with Elle's older brother Victor and the friendship is just one of the reasons why he's held back on making more of an effort to be with Elle, although they do have more than their share of clandestine encounters.

Elle and Oliver's non-relationship lasts for nearly a decade, with a lot of stop-and-go going on between them. Your heart can't help but break for Elle, who, in spite of an engagement with her late live-in boyfriend, always seems to set herself up for disappointment when it comes to Oliver aka Bean. There's no denying the depth of their feelings for one another, but Oliver appeared to take Elle for granted, constantly assuming that she would be there when he was finally ready for an actual relationship with her.

Oliver is a highly driven individual, with his primary focus on his education and then his medical career. There are reasons for his being as ambitious as he is, which certainly makes it easier to comprehend his actions. Still, there's no denying that there's a fair amount of frustration when it comes to his inability to commit to something (anything!) when it comes to Elle. Yes, he's always loved her, but doing absolutely nothing or the bare minimum to keep the connection going makes him increasingly unworthy of dear Elle.

This love story is more about having the right kind of love at the wrong time, especially considering how many opportunities Elle and Oliver had to be much more than they were for so long. Sometimes, a person simply wants to be secure in the knowledge that they matter and that the love they have for you is valued and appreciated. You can't help but wish people know the kind of gift they have in their hands, but sometimes, losing it is what makes opens your eyes to the truth. Kaleidoscope Hearts gets five-plus stars.

I found the City's women added a hint of humour to their desperate situation, and that, for me, lifted the story to allow more of a connection.

The narrative traces Elizabeth's imprisonment by her sister Mary, Mary's death and her enthronement, through her tempestuous relationship with Robert Dudley (played consummately by Tom Hardy, portrayed as a very self-centered and arrogant man) and the emergence of Mary Queen of Scots as a rival, though unlike The Golden Age, where Mary plays a large role, in this version she is never actually shown, only discussed. A lot of the events are portrayed in discussion or letters as is the death of Dudley and the defeat of the Spanish Armada, though a stirring recreation of Elizabeth's speech to the troops at Tilbury is a highlight of the film. The film does well in it's use of real quotes together with more modern usage of conversation. Great costumes and scenery

The death of Amy Robsart (Emila Fox) , Dudley's wife is portrayed as s suicide, though one that Dudley reacts callously to and the Elizabeth's rivalry with Lettice Knollys (Sienna Gillory) is part of the focus.
The last part deals with Elizabeth devotion to the young Robert Devereaux (Hans Mattheson) , Earlf of Essex, and frames Essex plot against Elizabeth as being intigated by his mother Lettice.
Anne Marie Duff portrays Elizabeth quite expertly. Effortlessly playing the role of a young Elizabeth through to her aging and death. Elizabeth is revealed as wise, strong, devoted to her country and people, at times capricious and ruthless when necessary. Her anguish at being forced to sign the death warrant of Mary Queen of Scots is revealed in a dream of herself being executed in Mary's place. Quite a lot of her life  is revealed in this film in dreams, such as her desire for Robin Dudleywhere she dreams of making love to him. Great speech near the end before her court summing up her feeling about her life and reign.",4,"[-3.27914420997719, -1.4769292773084817, -1.0426741633262875, -0.9922388597579306, -1.017845281774835]",-0.9922388597579306

Yes, I'm reading and enjoying a romance book that includes as a major character a dog with my cat sitting or sleeping next to me. And there is a satisfying romance beginning. In this story, the romance has a cute meet and some long talks, building a good basis for a continuing relationship. There is a touch of danger to bring them closer.
The only thing that bothers me is the meme of big man, small woman. I have been seeing it more and more in contemporary romance, and I am over it. When she can fit under his armpit, that is getting to be beyond annoying. We don't need the size differential to support him being an alpha male, which is another trope that is being overworked. Other than that, I am enjoying this series. I may not be a dog person, but I like dogs.

3648,"When I first started reading First Position, I was not sure if it was the book for me. I am not usually a fan of plots centered around a skill (dancing/football). Well, First Position surprised me. It was not centered around dancing or football; it was all romance! So, don't let the title fool you.

This book is the story of Emory and Mason. They have a past; a past that is filled with pain and heart break.

Emory was completely in love with Mason, but he left her when she refused to give up her dancing career. He wanted a Football Wife, that would sit in the stands and look pretty. He did not want a working wife.

Mason ended up getting exactly what he wanted, and he was miserable. He and his wife were getting a divorce. He had been injured, and his future in football is questionable. He is looking for a new team. While visiting a potential team, he runs into Emory.

A lot has changed for Emory, during the years that they have been apart. She was forced to give up her dreams of being a professional dancer, after an injury. She is now working as a photographer and living with her best friend. She has just broken up with her boyfriend. Her life is in total chaos, and she is not prepared to see Mason. She is not sure she can let him back into her life, but Mason is determined to win her back.

This book is filled with love, hate, pain, and secrets. Can Mason and Emory forget the past and focus on the future? To find out, you will have to read First Position.

This book was really well written. I love a reunion romance, and this one was one of the best. The characters were likable, and I felt like I knew each one personally. The editing was spot on. Over all, its a very good book.

** This book was very close to being a five star read. I just could not get past the way Mason allowed his mother to manipulate him. You will see what I mean. Other than that, it was perfection.

Would I recommend it? Yes

408,"I feel about Salman Rushdie's first big book roughly the same way I feel about Indian food.  The food features a fascinating melange of spices, smells and textures, but I have no desire to consume it.  Nor do I particularly comprehend the attraction of the cuisine of a dirt poor Third World country with more dietary taboos than you can shake a sitar at and, while heavy spicing is a perfectly logical substitute for substance, at the end of the meal one longs to ask: ""Where's the beef?"".  Similarly,  in his novel, Rushdie combines his signature Magical Realist style and the actual historical background of India since Independence with the family history of the Sinai's to create a bewildering mess of a novel that is heavy on Bombay slang.  The language is pungent but indecipherable and the story is ambitious but confusing.  The linguistic pyrotechnics and luxuriant prose have displaced the meat of the story.
I actually believe that India offers  a unique opportunity to the author of today.  With the end of the Cold War and peace in the Middle East, South Africa and Northern Ireland, many of the settings that offered built in tension have disappeared.  India, however, remains a corrupt political state, is rife with ethnic tension and is nearly at war with both Pakistan and China.  There are so many latent plot lines that it would seem an irresistible setting and I very much enjoyed books like Rohinton Mistry's  Such a Long Journey and Vikram Seth's A Suitable Boy (1993).  But, both are much more traditional, Western-style novels.  As is usually the case, the injection of magical realism into Rushdie's story ends up detracting from his tale rather than enhancing it.  The effort to create an Indian, or postcolonial, style did not work for me; a straightforward narrative, stripped of hocus pocus gimmickry, would have been much more enjoyable.

Are these messages of world conquest a fact that must be dealt with, or are they, in fact, intended to become a self-fulfilling prophecy? Interestingly, author Robert Charles Wilson makes Warden a relatively minor player in the attempt to thwart Kuin. For a while, he works as a computer programmer for a scientist (Sue) who has the closest handle on the math that would allow Kuin to send his messages into the past, yet he quits that job to be near his daughter. Instead, Wilson writes on a smaller and more personal scale. Warden is important and, because they are important to him, his daughter and second wife are important. Combining a fascinating near-future history with a highly sympathetic character makes for a compelling read.

8888,"I received an e-ARC of this novel through NetGalley and Random House Publishing Group - Alibi.

This second book in the Maggie Dove series was more enjoyable for me than the first because the major problem Maggie was dealing with is now being treated in a much more natural way. This is still a Christian cozy mystery, but the main character has moved forward in her personal life to the extent that she now responds to people and situations in ways that aren't completely irritating.

Maggie Dove and two of her friends have opened a detective agency in a village outside New York City. As a reader I just have to wonder how a place this small is ever going to sustain a detective business, but only time will tell about that. This time Maggie is visited by a member of the town's most wealthy and reclusive family with a job. Maggie turns down the job and suffers the wrath of one of her business partners (who is written as if she's constantly in the middle of a psychological breakdown) and complete ambivalence from the third partner. Thinking over the situation, Maggie decides to accept the job only to be told she's too late because something has already happened.

I will have to say that the solution to these problems Maggie encountered came as a complete surprise to me. Even so, these characters just don't interest me enough to make me curious about what is going to happen in future books. Good luck to Maggie and the gang; I gave it a two book try, that's enough.",2,"[-5.3498627618367784, -2.403630466650477, -1.157133481252179, -0.9926161546766684, -1.238749250662401]",-0.9926161546766684

Though there are glimpses of Bryson's characteristic wit and engaging ability to tell history, science, and other intellectually-stimulating yarns, the book is mostly just a log of his complaining about the architecture of British cities while eating at pubs. He does well to capture the unique culture of the British, but this is definitely one of his weaker works. I much more prefer his Short History of Nearly Everything, Made in America, The Mother Tongue, and Shakespeare: All the World's a Stage, to his travel writings.

618,"When I was invited to review this book, I must admit I was afraid it would be the standard ""happiness"" pitch. To my surprise and relief, this book turned out to be truly exceptional, beginning with the author's own story.

To be sure, much of the info in this book will be standard fare for anyone who's familiar with the life coaching industry. However, it's packaged in a way that appeals even to left-brained skeptics like me. The author cites research studies to back up each point. Some of the suggestions were totally new to me, and I thought I was deeply familiar with the field.

Just a few highlights that I enjoyed:

p. 55 - Work with a signature strength. This recommendation makes lots of sense to me. The book includes a link to a long online survey; I took the survey and found it surprisingly accurate. I'm a  little baffled by the authors suggestion to ""use it in a new way each day for a week.""

p. 67: I loved the discussion of Ellen Langer's research with ""senior"" men. Langer asked them to imagine themselves as they'd been 20 years earlier. They improved on physical as well as mental measures.

pp 72-73 - Great discussion of leisure. I really resonated to the notion that we tend to think any non-work activity is worthless. This belief becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

p. 121 - A startling experiment asks people to estimate how ""fortunate"" they would be if they were wounded in a bank robbery.  Great comment about interpretations of Wall Streeters!

p. 139 - Solving small problems can lead to big wins.

p. 163: Add 20 seconds to your day and gain several hours.

They called themselves the Pleasant Valley Page Turners. This is a pretty diverse group with the ages of these ladies ranging from their 30s to 90s. They decided that Sunny needed a man so they each set her up on a blind date. The dates went from bad to worse until Sunny took matters into her own hands.

When Edna sees Jake break into Sunny's neighbor's house and he's got a gun, it gets more serious. But it's still funny with Edna talking about what else he's got in his pants besides the gun. Edna's 90-something so her comments are pretty funny. When the neighbor is missing, Edna is sure Jake killed him (after all, he did have a gun).

Oh, My Dragon is the third book in the I like Big Dragons series by Lani Lynn Vale and it tells the story of Ian and Wink. I believe to fully understand and appreciate this story, you should read the series in order.

Oh, My Dragon begins with Wink heading home after her long day of work. As she walks into her apartment building, she finds Ian leaning over a dead body near her apartments front door. Wink freaks out and runs, but Ian quickly catches up to her. He puts his hand around her neck to quiet her, since the real killer was still in the building. Wink and Ian soon discover their matching tattoos after their touch and Ian begins to explain that they are fated mates.

Their love story has many twists and turns and is more emotional and less violent than the first two books. I was really looking forward to reading Ians story, as the first two books really built up the fear of Ian. Both Keifer and Nikolai warned their mates to not get too closed to Ian. I couldn't wait to learn more about the dangerous alpha male dragon rider, named Ian. I was a little disappointed as I built him up from what I read, but Ian was so complex and different than I expected. He made me feel emotional and I think that Wink helped Ian in many ways!
Im looking forward to the next in the series!

She has a limited support system and is used to taking care of things on her own. She is selfless and goes out of her way to help others.

Finn O'Riley is a busy bar owner just trying to keep it going. He is handsome and charismatic, but he works all the time at the expense of a real social life or fun. He does have a brother and a quirky group of friends that support him. It was easy to tell he is one of those closed off hotties that was just waiting for inspiration to show off his passion and heart. He was hot, sweet, thoughtful, and charming.

They develop a mutual attraction and flirty banter. Pru just wants Finn to be happy, but she has a big secret. And that secret could have a negative effect on Finn.

I liked all of the crazy side characters: his friends, Archer, Spencer, Elle, Willa, Haley, and his brother, Sean. I was also drawn to her protective boss, Jake, with his own issues and intense personality. And Thor is her mighty little dog that really came alive in the pages and took over all of his scenes.

I liked Finn and Pru together. They were compatible and had good chemistry. She brings Finn some balance, fun, and gets him to live a little. She finds that she wants to really belong somewhere. But the more attached he gets, the more her secret weighs on her and makes her hold back. She's always been alone and this could be a way to not only lose a man that  has come to mean more to her, but also her new group of wacky and supportive friends. She does not hold out much hope that Finn would forgive her lie of omission.

This is the first of the new Heartbreaker Bay series with a whole cast of quirky, fun, and interesting, single characters.

165,"The Redbreast is the American debut of Norwegian policeman Harry Hole - there are two earlier volumes which were published in Norway. Harry is the quintessential fictional detective - a loner, problem drinker, jaded, cynical, dogged, persistent and with his own standard of justice - which most of the time coincides with the law. Although this borders on caricature, that doesn't happen in this book. Harry comes across as believable - although at times predictable - although one wonders if this will hold true in the later volumes of the series.

In this book Detective Hole finds himself embroiled in a case of seemingly random but brutal murders which eventually tie back to World War II and Norwegian soldiers fighting for the Nazis on the Eastern Front. Harry also battles current day politics, neo-Nazis, the aftermath of an accidental shooting and his own personal demons while mentoring subordinates, falling in love and taking on a new job. The story-line also jumps back and forth between the present and World War II.

If this sounds confusing - well at times it is - which is a fault of this book. There is a very compelling plot - murder, revenge and betrayal - with a fairly well developed cast of characters, which all gets lost at times among the numerous sub-plots and time frames. That being said, The Redbreast is still an engaging and enjoyable read - just a bit unnecessarily complicated.",3,"[-3.83855729903194, -1.3950921744876235, -1.2328595831764495, -0.9932920474150935, -1.1204220855224225]",-0.9932920474150935
9358,"An excellent mini series, The Triangle, brings to the screen the story of an unlikely group of people brought together by a mysterious millionaire wishing to find out more about the Bermuda Triangle.
I started to watch this series with very low expectations and boy was I surprised! The series starts off with a bang, immediately catching the viewer's interest and attention and never letting go. The plot as a whole is excellent! It is so incredibly done that one feels that they have been transported away and are actually present among the characters, seeing what they see, feeling what they feel, sensing what they sense.
On the down side, initially I did not care much for Emily Paterson, the deep ocean resource engineer, though by the end of the series she had become quite likable.
Moreover, Bruce Geller, the Australian professor of meteorology seemed much more like a surfer than a university professor.
Additionally, for someone who just lost his son and daughter-in-law, and found out that his granddaughter is an old woman kidnapped by the Navy, grandpa is taking it pretty calmly (and so is grandma)!
Nevertheless, Lou Diamond Phillips, Sam Neil, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances. Very well written and very well presented, it combines drama, action, and adventure, making it a film guaranteed to provide more than just a few thrills.
The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the special effects, and the music are all wonderful!
In short, The Triangle is a series definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!

This book was the first I read in this trilolgy. I really enjoyed the writing, the characters, the steam and everything else.
Come to think of it this book was my first ever enemies-to-lovers kind of romance experience. It was entertaining to read both Bryan's and Pamela's inner conflicts and how they have fallen for an unlikely match. I liked very much the relationship Pamela had with her mother and sister, it was enviable. I can only hope this part of the story was based on true life family dinamics. I also liked the sorrowful but unique story of Pamela's marriage. Talking about background I would have liked a little bit more of it on Bryan's side.

My opinion: While I enjoyed this book, particularly the WWII aspect of it, I must admit that this wasn't my favorite of the author.

8398,"Bennett never fails to pull me into one of her love stories. She is great at creating characters you cant help but fall for. Here youve got the typical playboy who falls for the sweet and innocent girl, but their story is twisted by Olivias medical condition. I liked that Garrett doesnt know about her condition right from the start, so that you can see they genuinely fall for each other. As big as Olivias condition is in this story, its not all-encompassing, which worked better for me because I like that their relationship isn't based on some kind of complex, if you know what I mean.

Garrett surprised me, in a good way, with how much he cared for Olivia, how quickly he gave into his strong emotions. Its true that was a the cliche playboy before he met her, but in his case, it was simply because he never found a girl worth his dedication, not that he had some dark past he was running away from. I think that fit with the story and his relationship with Olivia. Olivia was a bit more hesitant with how serious the relationship got, which was understandable given his reputation and her situation, but I did get mad at her at times for pushing him away so much. Garrett was the real winner in this story, so patient and understanding. I was impressed with how he handled Olivias condition and all her back and forth antics. Its always refreshing to see the roles reversed, because its usually the guy who puts on a front.

As always, it was a treat to see characters from the previous book in this one. Alex and Sutton are a great couple and it was nice checking in on them. It was also cool to see the leading stud of this series upcoming book, Zack. After what happens to him in this book, I can tell his story will be an emotional one.

The romance in this book is a bit on the sweet and sentimental side, so if that sounds like your kind of thing, then this is the book for you. Things move pretty fast, but it sort of fit with their predicament and it worked for them. The story flows nicely and Bennett keeps you entertained with plenty of humor, romance, and intrigue.

2867,"The time travel device of this book works because King is interested not in the Sci-Fi elements, but in the emotional and philosophical issues raised by the idea of time travel.  Thus, there is little explanation of how the time travel device works -- it's just there, as a ""rabbit hole"".  The reason we never get tired of reading about time travel is our desire to correct our mistakes; our desire to know whether there is a design in the universe - is life simply absurd and do we truly choose our own destinies; and the sneaking feeling of nostalgia that maybe things were better back in the day.

King thinks that while we can make a difference by our life choices, neither the past (nor the present, for that matter) really can be changed fundamentally.  All we can do is fall in love and make a difference in the immediate world around us.  As for the past -- in some ways it really was a lot better.  The food is better; the cars are better; the sense of freedom and control of our own destinies is stronger.  But the racism, tolerance for squalor, and environmental irresponsibility of the past can't be sustained.  In that sense,we can truly say we are making some progress.  The people are about the same, though King captures some of the real nastiness of 1963 Dallas and 1958 New England.  But even in these environments, truly strong, admirable, and unforgettable characters emerge.

On the downside, King does tend to the sentimental and some characters and conversations are real clunkers.  And while I'm satisfied with the conclusion, I think the alternative histories offered could have been a bit more subtle and compelling.

But the book is plain excellent and impossible to put down.  It will make a great movie -- and hopefully one is made.",4,"[-1.8226595041842126, -1.3131806542091977, -1.4813192238344157, -1.0128155775349983, -0.9937899343247067]",-0.9937899343247067

We had previously used Natural Balance Sweet Potato and Fish for our larger dogs and noticed that Ginger (the Yorkie) would scrounge around on the floor after they were done eating.  Whenever she got lucky, she would spend quite a bit of time trying to chew the kibble up, a daunting task with her few remaining choppers.  So we decided to get this Small Bite edition of the same Natural Balance formula.

After boarding her at a kennel for five days while we took a short trip, when we returned home we automatically put down her normal wet food, a bowl of water, and as usual a dish with some of this Small Bite kibble.  She ignored the wet food and immediately scarfed up the kibble.  Boy were we surprised!  The other great advantage is that her previously challenged digestive system has calmed down and she is back to a normal eating and elimination schedule.  No upset tummy and no accidents.

One King's Way is Craig's story (remember him? the bartender Joss kissed at the bar way back when she was trying to make Braden jealous?). In this book, Craig is a one-night-stand kind of guy who surprisingly feels an instant connection with the heroine: Rain. He's literally sex on a stick and she's the same with the addition of a sweet vulnerability. These two both have strong bonds with their family members, which is admirable but also annoying (let me clarify: Rain is annoying!) as their single-minded protectiveness clearly interferes with any long-term plans. Craig and Rain's attraction is smokin' hot but the relationship is complicated, and I just could not get on board with Rain's seemingly obsession when it came to protecting her sister. Regardless, Ms. Young managed to keep me entertained and engaged in a surprise post-series novella and I love her for that!

If you're a fan of the series then add this novella to your list. If you're a newbie, start at the beginning! Hint: books #1 and #3 are my absolute favorites. Enjoy!

.
Kathy Reichs has a good reason as to why he Temperance Brennan is so believable as a forensic anthropologist.  It is a career she has practiced for years.  Although this is the latest in a series.  Speaking in Bones can easily be read as a stand-alone.  In this offering Temperance has a lot on her mind.  Hazel Strike, AKA Lucky is an amateur cyber detective who brings Temperance the audio recording of a young girl being terrorized.  Lucky believes the girl is case of Cora Teague, a girl that supposedly went missing three years previously.  But no one her missing to the police.  Temperance begins looking into it by going to the backwoods where the recording and the bones Hazel thinks are Coras were first found.  All she finds are more questions and more bones.  With rumors of Satanic cult and a fanatical Religious sect to deal with Temperance finds danger everywhere she looks. Not to mention the marriage proposal from Ryan, Temperance is having second and third thoughts over accepting.

As always Kathy Reichs Temperance is strong and confident when it comes to her work, but timid in her personal life.  the plot of the story flow smoothly and as a whole moves quickly.  There is one place towards the front of the book that is a bit lengthy with descriptive dialog that  has you working at keeping your eyes open, which is a rarity for Reichs books but I was glad to see the scene to end and move on to more interesting topics.

I really liked it and think that most children, boys or girls would enjoy the book. The main character is a Gilbert, young farm boy from Nebraska and a young Martian girl.

There are crop circles appearing in Mr. Johnson's fields and he thinks that Gilbert is the culprit, but that is not the case but Gilbert goes to investigate and finds Aoleon, a Martian girl just sitting within the crop circle. Now this is most peculiar as Gilbert has never seen such a thing as crop circles let alone a Martian girl. His curiosity is piqued though so he goes along with her on her saucer. Of course any young child enjoys a good adventure and so does Gilbert. I think it will be fun to see what adventures await him with Aoleon in the next chapters.

I thoroughly enjoyed every moment I spent with these two, their powerful story crept into my head and heart and reaffirmed my belief that Ms. Phillips is a true master at her craft!! I highly recommend you give this read a try, it is one of those stories that will invade your thoughts, steal the breath from your lungs, move you to tears, and stay with you long after the last page has been turned!

The 65 watt equivalent rating seems about right to me: ample for a reading or close use, but too dim for an overhead fixture unless you're in s small room or favor hotel-style light.  I like the spectrum better here, somewhat warmer, so they don't have that spooky spaceship quality that some LEDs have. Time will tell whether they'll last as long as advertised, but i'll definitely come back and whine if the burn out early or start to flicker (as has an LED lamp I bought in the past).

198,"Alex Dryden is apparently the pseudonym of a journalist with long experience covering Russia--15 years in the country--and security matters. Though it's not clear what the point of the pen name is since his picture is posted online and a set of cover blurbs from Steven Fry, Hugh Laurie and Emma Thompson--all of whom were in Footlights Theater at Cambridge--suggests a certain commonality of background. At any rate, Whoever he is in real life, the author must have felt his non-fiction dispatches were being ignored, because Red to Black is essentially an anti-Putin polemic cast in the guise of a novel. And a pretty good one at that.

Finn is an MI6 agent in Russia with a very useful mole in the government. Anna, the youngest female colonel in the KGB, is offered up as a honey trap. But the two fall in love and over a period of years work to expose The Plan, a long term effort by members of the Russian security services to achieve by more capitalistic and acquisitive means the subversion of Europe that the USSR so spectacularly failed at. Dryden portrays a Russia on the march, using its energy resources to triumph over a recumbent Western Europe. Anyone familiar with Russia's own demographic crisis will find it even harder to take the bear seriously now than we did twenty years ago, but the analysis of why the USSR fell and what Putin and company would like to achieve is lucid and compelling. It's a fair warning, if perhaps an overblown one.",3,"[-3.282574885826393, -1.756478610080401, -1.3077875821507696, -0.9946604731292225, -1.2161705738956545]",-0.9946604731292225

The Wayward Saints are back at it again!  This time around it's Casey (Anslie's best friend) and Gunner (Brantley's cousin and WS member) who are hooking up.  Told in multiple POV, this second installment in the Wayward Saints series tells the on-again, off-again story of Casey and Gunner.  Not quite as much action in this one as in Wayward Angel.  However, that can be chalked up to Casey's hesitancy in hooking up with a biker.  That being said, there is still plenty of action and LOTS of hotness!  Casey and Gunner are definitely NOT shy in the bedroom.  Most of the characters introduced in the first installment, come back for an appearance in this one.  Plus there are new additions as well.

K Renee makes you root for the characters but keeps in enough suspense to keep you reading.  The story and characters are well developed and at times, I felt like I was right there with them.  Although the first installment was just as good as this one, I do see improvements in the author's writing.  She brought me deeper with this one.  Can't wait to see how deep she can bring me in the third installment!

When Jordan left the Marines he got a job with Pierce Securities. But since he's a newbie, he's given the worst assignments. Because he had been on so many missions in the military, he thought these menial jobs were a waste of his experience. When he finally got a missing persons case, he hoped to show his boss how good he was. But he knew it wouldn't be easy since the police hadn't gotten anywhere with finding the woman who had been kidnapped from her apartment.

Mia and Jordan lived across the hall from each other and while Mia thought he was hot, she didn't do relationships. So a night or two with him is all she wanted. It looked like a couple of nights wasn't enough for either of them though. When he saw Mia being taken, he'd do anything to find her.

Jordan was not happy being out of the military and working at the security company. He really thought he was too good for the jobs he was given there. That made him hard to like and I wanted to slap him upside the head to knock some sense into him. But he was hot and that was all Mia was looking for. Mia was working hard to save enough money to bring her sister to live with her, leaving no time for a relationship. Both Jordan and Mia were surprised that their agreed upon casual sex turned into more. It didn't take long before I liked both of these people.

Many times, especially in a series that only has one book so far, and particularly when that first book was read a long time ago, I'll feel lost for good bit while starting the new book. And as I said, that wasn't the case here. There's something just so enjoyable about slipping back into this series and these characters. So kudos to Ms. Harrison.

Peri seemed much more settled this time around. Sure she's on the run, and so much happens in this book it's almost frenetic at times, but Peri seemed to have a much better sense of herself and who she is. Sure there's still a long road ahead and questions to be answered but I felt much more at ease with her this time, allowing me to better enjoy her character and further immerse myself into the story surrounding her. I especially enjoyed the glimpses into her past, the things she's forgotten and the dynamic between her and Silas. There's such a history there, but we're only scratching the surface as of yet, and I can't wait to see how things further develop between the two.

Speaking of scratching the surface, I feel like we're only just starting to see Peri's real skills, and the full depth of the world. Every time I think I have all the rules down and know exactly who the characters are, one of them throws a twist in the game and changes my perspectives. It definitely kept me on my toes!

This book continues where the first one in the series left off and I must say the second is even better than the first! No, you don't have to have read the first one to read this one, but I do recommend it to know some of the backstory to make the book come more alive.

The only one tiny thing that bothered me in this book was the use of the term one-bodies/one-body a little too much.

Jess Lincoln left New York to start her life over again after leaving her abusive ex-Conrad. She now owns/runs a cattle ranch with the help of old man Charlie. She has absolutely no idea what she is doing. It is nothing like she expected

Wyatt Wade finds Jess out in the field having a crying jag because she can't get the cattle to come in.  He takes her back home and steps in to help.  He knows right off she is in way over her head.  He has some of his friends also help get control back of the ranch.  I think that he actually finds Jess' cattle ranch situation a little humorous.

Jess and Wyatt have instant attraction but Jess fights it as Wyatt is a Bear shifter.  She is very uneasy about shapeshifters as her ex is a wolf shifter.

Jess is out on a date with Wyatt when her ex-Conrad shows up with friends.  During the confrontation between the two groups of friends Conrad is able to get Jess alone and beats her until Wyatt puts a stop to it.

Conrad is trying to prove that Jess can't leave him. He starts killing off her cattle in attempt to get her to come to him.  Wyatt and Conrad end up in a big fight, Bear vs Wolf.

Not going to give any spoilers...but let's just say that Jess might just end up with the right man.

983,"Jonasson is one of my new favorite authors. His story-telling style is one of a kind. His humor is impeccable. His collage of characters are unusual, dodgy, odd, weird, utterly unpredictable and yet somewhat endearing. The story of 100-year-old man who climbed out the window and disappeared, which could have used a punchier title between us, sticks with you. It's not a feel-good novel so much as it's a funny satire of key parts of world history retold through the eyes of Alan Karlsson, who happens to get involved in it all rather innocently. The book is told in flashbacks - the present time where we follow Alan out of that window and into his new series of adventures, one funnier than the other - and the past starting with Alan's childhood and building up to the present time.
I loved this book. I loved Alan's accounts of having met up and worked for Stalin, Churchill, Truman, General Franco (whoever he was!?!), and so many other notables the funniest of which is Herbert Einstein, the half-brother of Albert Einstein, and Albert's happy-go-lucky approach to all things in life. It really is something of a shock when you meet Alan at 99 years of age and this may be a spoiler but I have to say it, so consider that your warning, when the fox kills the cat and he gets angry for the first time in his life, at 99 years of age did I mention? And soon, within a few hours, realizing that while his mood is driven by revenge until the fox (and much else) gets properly blown up, that revenge isn't really all that great a thing to live for.

Battles, wars, and crusades have been waged and fought for days, years, and even centuries over what exactly happens when we shuffle off this mortal coil and . . .

From David Eagleman, who heads the Laboratory of Perception and Action at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas and is the founder of the Initiative on Neuroscience and Law, comes a unique and unusual book called SUM: Forty Tales From the Afterlives.  With a strong cover quote from Philip Pullman, SUM presets forty ""What ifs?"" as Eagleman ponders the many possibilities of what might exist in the next life, if there is one.  For some it would be a fantasy come true, for others a nightmare; a personal heaven, or a feared hell.

Eagleman approaches the book from a scientific point of view, analyzing each possible afterlife in an empirical way and weighing its validity:  some entries are short, some are long; some have a lesson to teach, others propose a moral at the victim's expense.  And what can the reader take from SUM?  Don't expect to be convinced one way or another from Eagleman on whether there really is an afterlife.

1922,"The Messenger is written by Siri Mitchell who is a new author to me. I chose this book to review because I love historical novels. T time period in this book is set in is during the Revolutionary War 1778 in Philadelphia. The title comes from the character, Hannah Sunderland who is a Quaker, who ends up being a spy for General Washington and the Colonial Army.  There is an entire side story as to how all of this comes about but I won't give it away.

This is not a typical romance type novel, there is very little ""romance"" and is really more about the historical aspects and everything that went on during that time from Hannah's and Jeremiah's (the young man in the story) perspectives. The British take over her family's home, her brother is in jail for being in the Colonial Army, and Quakers don't believe in war and have dismissed their son from being apart of their life. There are so many little details and information to take in with this story that it took me some time to read it and understand what all was going on.

I enjoyed it, though it wasn't as good as I was expecting, I always have high hopes for such books.

I am interested in more of Siri Mitchell's books because as an author she did an incredible job with her research and writing.

If you enjoy historical fiction and aren't wanting to read a sappy love story that is predictable, this book is for you!

9482,"""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" opens with a landscape of hardscrabble poverty that could be many places: I was totally unfamiliar with the plot, and thought perhaps it was set in Africa). Gradually the story is developed, centered on the lives of six-year old Hushpuppy, the introspective and often isolated daughter of Wink. They live on what most would consider the wrong side of a Louisiana levee, in an isolated community known as ""The Bathtub"".

Wink and Hushpuppy are both struggling with abandonment (Hushpuppy's mom left the family under circumstances never fully explained), and Wink also suffers from other maladies. His drinking (and that of many of The Bathtub's adults that are his peers) is evident from the beginning. It's also clear that he has other medical issues. Eventually, after a hurricane has come and gone and profoundly disrupted The Bathtub's residents way of life, Wink has to tell Hushpuppy about the leukemia that is killing him.

Throughout this movie, Hushpuppy is influenced by other adults, some that come and go and some that stay: the Bathtub's regulars, the women who populate a floating catfish restaurant and nightclub, the folk healer who teaches her and her and other Bathtub kids some of the hard truths about the world (""we are all meat...""). She is also aligned with the natural world around her, the rhythms of rural livestock, and their eventual role in placing food on the table.

The beasts of the title are aurochs, symbolic of fear and loss that appear in Hushpuppy's visions of the world. And make no mistake about it: it is a world that is wet and dirty, with adults streaked with violence, devoid of true warmth or connection (""I can count the number of times I've been picked up"" she says at one point).

Not only does Josie have to take care of her uncle, but she needs to settle his wifes business affairs which include a knitting shop.  She has her work cut out for her.

As soon as she arrives, she is made to feel like an outsider starting with her ornery great uncle. Everyone in town makes sure she realizes shes not welcome. They want her sell the knitting shop and go back home to New York City. Josie does manage to find a couple of friends along the way.

However, things take a nasty turn when a dead body is found in the knitting shop and members of the town council make it clear they want Josie to sell the shop immediately. It's obvious to Josie that someone is hiding something and she intends to find out what that something is.

Josie Blair is the newest amateur sleuth to hit the cozy mystery genre and she makes a great first impression. I loved how she stood up to her great uncle and never backed down even when he clearly didn't want her help. In fact, she didn't back down from anyone, not even those who wanted her to leave Dorset Falls immediately.

3807,"It has taken me way too long to get back to the simple world that Chris Philbrook has created for Adrian. By simple I mean pretty straight forward as far as a zombie apocalypse is concerned.

Beware that this is book 2 in a series, so it might do you some good to listen to the first book first. Even thought I believe that Alone No More can stand by itself if need be.

At first I was taken aback, because this book started in the past. With things that we did not know about from book one. I had to double check that I was listening to the correct audiobook. After this initial shock I found myself getting wrapped up in the added story lines.

If you thought that Dark Recollections was missing the back story of Adrian, you will be pleased to know that Alone No More will quench some of that thirst. Not only with Adrians story but the story of several other interesting characters.

I did find it quite oxymoronic that the title is Alone no More and Adrian was alone for the majority of this story. However when people started showing up in his life again the crap hits the fan. As we all know the most dangerous things in the zombie apocalypse are the other survivors.

Philbrook ended the book at the perfect point to make you need to listen to the next in the series, something that I will be doing soon.

James Foster is simply amazing in this series. There is something magical that happens with his performance when he is Adrian talking, I mean writing, in his journal. True chemistry, he creates a real conventionality, a sincere joviality at times and disparity at others.

Now I am not sure how these two got connected, more than likely random fate or coincidence. I will choose fate because an author needs a stellar narrator to bring his vision to light. Even though Foster is a relative newcomer to the narration world, I can not think of another that would give the listener the same experience.

The town leaders have had enough of him, and decide to bring in gunman Virgil Cole (Harris) and his associate Everett Hitch (Mortensen) to clean things up.  As marshal, Cole demands some leeway to take care of things his way, and that is granted by the town.

Not many westerns make it to theaters these days, but ""Appaloosa"", Ed Harris' second directorial effort does not disappoint.  The leads all produce real characters that are not perfect people.

I have plenty of apps, websites, and TV forecasters when I want that.  I do like knowing how warm/cold it is outside, though, and the clock is clear and easy to read.  The unit is easy to set up and setting the clock is very intuitive (no scrambling around for the directions to know how many times to push and hold a bunch of tiny, confusing buttons).  I had another one just like this, but the batteries in the transmitter leaked and after almost 10 years, caused the transmitter to stop working.  I decided to get another whole unit just in case the transmitter wasn't the problem, but it was, so now I handily have receivers in a couple different rooms (note that you can also add transmitters if you want to monitor different areas in your yard).

This handy gadget lets me save quite a bit on air conditioning in the summer.  In the morning, when it's cooler outside, I open all the windows.  I watch the outside temperature and as it gets warmer, I close the windows and trap the cool air inside.  In the evening I do the same thing, using a window fan to help exhaust the warm air out of the house.  During the day, my house averages about 8-10 degrees cooler than outside on all but the hottest and most humid days, so it's not always enough, but it often is.",4,"[-1.4293163437693053, -2.2979732153511825, -1.4520111222998744, -0.9982163547672978, -1.2390568861781492]",-0.9982163547672978

Michelle Lancaster flees her hometown of Spirit, Louisiana to spend time at a beach retreat in Driftwood Bay, Florida and all she wants is to be left alone to grieve after a tragedy that changed her life.

Brodie Stevens is laid-back boat captain and artist and when he sees Michelle on the beach riding her horse Coco he feels a strong connection between them and he's willing to do anything in his power to get to know Michelle better and see if they can have a future together since he believes that together they can heal each other.

I enjoyed reading about Michelle and Brodie, they both had to deal with pain from their past, especially Michelle. I also enjoyed reading about Sam and the town of Driftwood.

The book deals with a very sad subject so at times it was a bit depressing to read but I thought the author dealt with the subject in a good way.

I did feel like the ending was rushed and that is way I gave the book 3.5 stars and not 4 stars.",3,"[-5.242634739312848, -1.1900590283502497, -1.107923023923234, -0.9982524166406763, -1.0655214514911024]",-0.9982524166406763

In 48 pages the book explains the basic structure of the game from the opening coin toss to the final game clock hitting zero. Each page is printed in full color and utilizes photos of NFL players mixed in with a little kid cartoon type character interspersed with some text. Visually it's an attractive layout but this is a book you'll need to read with your kids as the rules will require some additional side explanation that is a result of the inherent complexity of the game particularly for youngsters being exposed to it for the first time.

1004,"Review by Jennifer

Have you ever been hit with a blow so devastating that you weren't sure how you would recover from it? That is exactly what happens to Sydney in the beginning of this story. However the saying, when one door closes another one opens turns out to be true. Only in this case it was the wrong phone number that opened up a new life for Sydney, one that she never thought she would get.

Right from the start this story caught my attention. When Sydney and Brian met it was fuuuunny. I was totally laughing my butt off. I couldn't get enough of this story in the beginning. Brian was a very loveable, sweet character but he is hiding a secret of his own. He is living with very painful memories that he is trying to overcome and he may never get past them. Brian is in a very dark place and the only person who seems to be able to bring him out of it is Sydney.

Sydney is fresh out of bad relationship that she didn't realize was bad until she was out of it. Her self -esteem is at a low point and she isn't looking for anything serious. She doesnt realize the impact that she is having on Brian and she really doesnt know the impact that he will have on her life.

Four Letter Word is a story about living with your regrets, living with guilt and trying to move on. Its also about falling in love again and accepting people for who they are, not what you want them to be.

There were definitely parts of this story that I loved but there we also periods where I had trouble staying connected with the story. Overall though, I did really enjoy these characters and their friendship and I would really like to see a book about Tori & Jamie (Sydney & Brians best friends) come out. They were terrific second characters! This was a good read with some deep, emotional parts but also some funny and heartwarming moments.",3,"[-3.6227487531817752, -1.137441541237346, -1.3132644390378865, -0.9984399569618818, -1.1652944468094084]",-0.9984399569618818
6518,"Let me begin by saying that I have read every book written by the fabulous Portia Moore. I have enjoyed every single one!

This is a friends to enemies to friends to lovers story. Confused? This will all make sense if you read What Happens After before jumping into this one. While this book CAN be read as a standalone, I think it will give you a better understanding of Lisa's past, her character, and what led up to her current predicament.

Portia has fulfilled a wish for me. I was always hoping Lisa and Aiden would get together. It just made sense. They both come from a pretty crappy childhood, both stubborn, and both speak their mind.

My only complaint is that they didn't come together quick enough. Lots of angst going on! You know they both want each other, but don't want to risk screwing up their friendship.

I have to note that I was SO happy that Zachary made an appearance in this book. Zachary is a character we met in What Happens After.

Also, last but not least, we get to catch up with Chris and Lauren. These characters are from the If I Break series. I definitely recommend you check it out!

They were then out-of-sight, out-of-mind and left to eke out an existence.  Now the old marquess is dead, his widow has run off after bilking the estate and his heir and his brother Gideon are left to straighten out the mess.  Gideon's assignment is Winnefred and he has his work cut out for him.

This wasn't an action-packed story of high adventure; it's a well-written story of two people falling in love with lots of humor and great, witty repartee going on.  That always makes for a fun read.

This would have been a 4 star, maybe 4.5 star read for me had it not been for the PTSD trope...yes, Gideon suffered from it so he couldn't bring himself to fall in love.  Furthermore, that jazz went on way too long.  His angst eventually got on my nerves.  I empathized with him...up to a point and I've had personal experience with it so I DO understand the wretchedness and helplessness of the disorder.  But.  I'm seriously tired of it when it's presented as the reason for the hero being unable to fall in love and marry.  That makes this no different than those unpleasant novels in which the heroine can't bring herself to marry for various and sundry reasons.

Another thing that stuck in my craw was the introduction of a secondary romance that went nowhere.  The author offered a few tidbits and I really became interested in the romance but tidbits were all we got with a little hea tacked on near the end as an afterthought.  That romance should have either been left out entirely or given more story.  It was a letdown..

In fairness, if the things that pushed my buttons don't push yours, this should be a very amusing and entertaining tale to read.

I live in the book I am reading and always think of what else happens, carrying the story in my mind past where the writer ended it.  So I have to wonder how everyone got along when it comes out that the wife did not reveal her past, not lied about it but just put it out of her mind.  Deception by omission? Especially when her past includes a criminal brother, incarcerated, for murder no less, murdering his father, who was her father also.  When the brother escapes and visits the family he never knew, along with another prisoner, their mission is to take what they need to survive their trek through the Adirondacks.  And no he is not asking for his estranged sisters help, he is just going to take what he needs and move on.  Being locked up for so long he is a stranger to the modern techno devices of the current time and being clueless leads him to destroy what he does not know he needs.  As so happens his companion is a giant physically but a midget mentally so tossing some folks around to convince them to give up the goods is not a problem.  Even killing is on the menu, an impulse type of thing.  It is an action packed plot that easily sweeps the reader along with it to the end.

It was enough to get the story across without it being overkill. The changes from IMs to emails to status reports, etc kept things fresh and kept me engaged in the story. Given the fact that I wasn't in the mood for reading a long book, I liked the way it all was presented to me. As for the story itself, Ill admit, I was a bit confused at first. Theres a lot going on, a lot of names and lingo you have to get used to. But, once you get the hang of the setting and its characters, thing just flowed together so well. I was hooked!

Kady and Ezra were pretty interesting characters. At times they were quite comical and I liked being in their heads and hearing what they had to say. Kady is pretty snarky and Ezra is a bit of a cheeseball, but in a cute way. I liked how even though they have a rocky relationship, you can tell the feelings are there and how the authors play it up is pretty sweet. Theres also a slew of secondary characters that kept things going outside of the romance. And, lets not forget the twisty and crazy things going on in this intergalactic world of theirs. Things get intense pretty quickly and its hard to turn away from the book.

Dont let the fact that its over 600 pages scare you. I read this book fairly quickly, and thats with the remnants of reading slump lingering about. Also, despite this book being over-hyped, it might just be warranted in this case. I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did, especially given the hype. Those things always lead to high expectations, which lead to disappointment the majority of the time. Luckily, that wasn't the case here. I say, go in knowing that you're going to get a different kind of read. Its pretty fast-paced and entertaining.

So many series place character drama over plot development, and some of this series has done just that, but not so in this installment. Those of you looking for soul mate angst and Quinn drama will be sorely disappointed. Those of you, like me, who love a good plot, an exciting storyline, and a detailed mystery, will love this. The series, and this book, do have one shortcoming though. Riley seems to bounce back and forth from wanting to be only committed to Quinn to wanted to jump any good looking male in the vicinity. While I was a tad irritated with this at first, I'm used to it now, and I don't expect anything less from her. I think Riley is one of the most unique heroines that I've read in any genre. She cares about what goes on around her, she thinks about the consequences before doing anything, and feels very guilty when she messes up. It would be one thing for her to blame her wolf and not be concerned with her infidelity, but that's not the case. She is complex, and she is not perfect. Her raging hormones were once a source of irritation, but now I feel they just add to her depth. I can't wait for the ninth installment in this series, even if it is mostly character based. I've grown to love every character in this series, and I applaud Keri Arthur's ability to create such an engrossing mystery with such fully realized characters.

The story begins when our hero, kicked out of the British army and sleeping on a friend's couch (a friend who really wants to see him gone), is called to a meeting with the Foreign Office that turns out to be some kind of intelligence group. They say he's exactly the kind of man they need: intelligent, quick-thinking, able to react to changing circumstances. They want to put him on payroll as an assassin. In the nation's best interests, of course.

Our hero agrees. He's killed in the course of his career for his country so this can't be much different. And the money is an incentive, too.

So he's given his target's name--Geoffrey Button--and location while his new employers make travel arrangements. But when he reaches Geoffrey, he's surprised to discover that in fact, his job is to protect Geoffrey, not kill him. What's more, there may be a traitor close to his employers.

From there, the story goes in all directions as he and Geoffrey dodge Russian assassins, a Chinese assassin, the local cops, and their own countrymen. Narrow escapes and helpful beauties abound.

I really wanted to give this book four stars. But (and I'm discounting my personal aversion to the hero who seems way too full of himself for my tastes) the need for a good editor kept intruding. If this were polished up, I would have given it four stars.

8582,"Macy Carrington and Cal Carson are forced to be around each other at times due to their interwined friendships with Matt and Mac Connover. Macy and Cal clash, fight, taunt, tease, and share a mutual disdain. Some is based on jealous for their shared best friend Mac's attention and some is based on the fact that they are completely different.

Cal thinks Macy is a rich, spoiled, opinionated, condescending Ice Princess. She does not do repeats or relationships. Only her best friend Mac knows what drives Macy to act the way she does.

She calls him ""Saint Cal"" for his holier-than-though attitude. He's a beer drinking, good guy, lawyer, who she considers a neanderthal. He is looking for love and stability, but so far it has eluded him even though his Ex would like to change that.

But their anger, taunts and insults make good, heated foreplay. And one challenge too far sends them spinning into hot, uncontrolled sexual bliss that they never saw coming. So good that Macy is willing to break her no seconds rule for him. But Cal knows going back for more is a very bad idea. Avoid avoid, deny, deny!

But when she needs professional help, he can't avoid her any longer and it only adds another layer of complication and ""Do not cross this line"" scenario. Their minds might know it, but their bodies aren't as smart.

Whoa! Who knew Cal and Macy could have such scorching, hot chemistry lurking under all that loathing? They are so different, but so very combustible. I loved their banter both angry and sexy. They play off each other so well both verbally and physically. We get Cal's point of view and little tidbits of Macy from her diary entries that hint at some things going on with her that I cannot wait to uncover.

This was a fast, witty, steamy introduction to this Legal Affairs spin off and I am totally hooked! I enjoyed getting more with Matt and Mac Connover as well.

While this is book four of an established mystery series, I found it easily readable as a standalone novel. It has Ms. Andrews trademark southern setting and strong southern women who have to deal with outlandishly funny predicaments.

The story starts out less than blissfully. BeBe gets bad news from her ex-husbands lawyer, and from there the drama and comedy take off. From runaway pets, goofy construction workers,overly enthusiastic wedding helpers toa fianc photographed with a gorgeous, touchy woman while out of town on business, there is no end of things for Weezie and BeBe to deal with.

Weezie and BeBeare great characters; they're strong, sassy, and charming. The plot is straight forward and well paced making Christmas Bliss a light-hearted read.

1137,"The Power of Myth is based on a six-part PBS television series hosted by Bill Moyers. It contains interview transcripts of a conversation between Joseph Campbell and Bill Moyers at the Star Wars ranch about mythology, philosophy, religion and more coverage not included in the television series. It may not be the best of Joseph Campbell's work but it is the most accessible for readers. It has aged somewhat because interviews are conducted differently now so the format may not appeal to everyone. The real value is the years of wisdom coming through from Campbell in his simple answers and sincere delivery. He isn't trying to sell you anything or rehash old ideas.

9 Chapters: 1. Myth and the Modern World, 2. The Journey Inward, 3. The First Storytellers, 4. Sacrifice and Bliss, 5. The Hero's Adventure, 6. The Gift of the Goddess, 7. Tales of Love and Marriage, 8. Masks of Eternity, 9. The Tale of Buddha

Both men examine many common motifs (e.g. hero myths) and provide insights and explanations. For anyone who wants to know more about the common themes we see in film, books and music this is an essential read. While more depth is provided elsewhere, such as the works of Dr. Carl Jung, this book is very accessible for people who want to understand the meaning and power behind symbols and time-honored themes that have inspired people for thousands of years. Some background in mythology is almost essential because Dr. Campbell weaves many different ideas together in this work in the old-school philosophical tradition. Overall, the book is a fairly light and enjoyable read.

I re-read this book and must admit the transcript format could have been edited to include more salient ideas from Campbell. However, the experience and wisdom of Dr. Campbell comes through splendidly in many passages. He speaks clearly about myth in philosophy, religion, and even fiction. There is discussion on the applicability of these ancient stories to people then and today. The book's ability to break down complex ideas is admirable. I had read dozens of philosophy texts before reading The Power of Myth and I wish I found it sooner. It's not as information dense as some would like but it is a classic now. Dr. Campbell speaks from years of experience and it comes across here in a friendly voice. There is much wisdom in his responses to consider.",3,"[-3.030008942753436, -1.0620083142039134, -1.1737244181471067, -1.0024150918804833, -1.2463184619531118]",-1.0024150918804833

Good versus evil, man versus woman, and the future versus the past. In 1974 the Atlanta Police Department is attempting to incorporate women into it's ranks. The good ole boy network which has driven this department for decades will have none of it. However, in the space of six months several police officers have been gunned down in cold blood. Maggie Lawson a somewhat new officer is charged with breaking in brand new rookie Kate Murphy. Maggie's brother Jimmy, and her uncle Terry both longtime cops are determined to get Maggie off the force. Shockingly one night shift Jimmy is wounded by ""The Shooter"", with partner Don being killed. The men of the Atlanta PD become enraged. The kid gloves are coming off, they will allow no rule or policy from stopping them from tracking down ""The Shooter"", and preforming immediate justice done. Maggie and the very raw rookie Kate are teamed up and working the case as if they are detectives. With non stop action, and some incredible twists and turns this story line is pure high octane. Author Karin Slaughter has done it again building a masterpiece by using some colorful and very hard nosed characters. Dialog in this book sizzles. The plot's foundation is set in stone and capable of sustaining a high quality mystery thriller. I really enjoyed every page as they flew by so quickly. I couldn't wait to get to the end to find out what would happened. Then again, I've never read a Karin Slaughter book that hasn't been spectacular. I'd highly rate, and recommend this thriller to anyone who is even just a casual mystery reader. Rest assured the hard core thriller readers will eat this one up quickly.

I am familiar with the area the author made her fake town in but the towns that she mentions around it are real.  The author really captured the area and some of the peoples attitudes.  The story was really good also.  Yes it was romance but not the over extreme love dovey type I hate.  There were a couple side stories in the book that were very good.  To me the main point of the book was not romance but forgiveness of others and of your own decisions that may have affected others.  One other thing I really did appreciate the author bring about the Oregon Coast was the affliction called S.A.D. (Seasonal Affective Disorder) which is very real and in that area it can be very overcast or rainy most of the year but still a beautiful area.  Do visit it if you every get a chance.

Instead of fun in the sun on a sandy beach, they would be staying at a trendy mountain resort surrounded by snow, and ski slopes. It was the last thing she would voluntarily sign herself up for, which is why her friends have chosen to band together and guilt her into going. Knowing that she doesn't know how to ski, they figure the best way to make her comfortable with this whole situation is to sign her up for ski lessons. They have her best interests at heart, and all think she is in desperate need of some fun, and hope that some fun on the slopes may lead to a opportunity for her to find a little romance too...

Jacob Berkley has recently purchased a trendy mountain resort and is quite pleased with its success so far, and is willing to make sure his guests are treated to the best service possible. While doing his morning rounds he is mistaken for a ski instructor by one of his guests, and while he shouldn't mislead her, he just isn't quite ready to correct her. Something about her intrigues him, so he decides spending one day on the slopes with her can't hurt...

1595,"Joy Fielding has been writing for a long time and I became a huge fan after reading her deliciously suspenseful book SEE JANE RUN  That was an amazing literary psychological novel of true suspense.  Since then her books have been hit or miss.  I loved STILL LIFE and HEARTSTOPPER but really didn't like SHADOW CREEK or NOW YOU SEE HER.  I found her style to be turning more mainstream and many novels even took on a Mary Higgins Clark style with one dimensional characters and slight plot lines.

With this new one SOMEONE IS WATCHING Joy Fielding pretty much returns to her true form.  When it comes to the plot she is masterful here with believable twists and turns and suspense that truly will keep the reader breathless.  The characters are another story.,  The main character Bailey Carpenter is well developed and her psychological profile mixed with the great story are what make the novel work.  Other characters can tend to be pretty one dimensional and some conversations are pretty silly.  But from the first truly dramatic scene in the book Fielding turns into an A+ writer in regards to the strong plot.  Her writing there shows she still has the chops for an excellent psychological thriller.  Read till that scene and Fielding will pull you in with it and make you read till the end.  Her sometimes too detailed descriptions of clothing, furnishings and the like which are truly a la Higgins Clark need to be just overlooked.  The overall read here is excellent and to Ms. Fielding I say write a truly great novel like SEE JANE RUN to  remind your readers you still have it.  And I guarantee new readers will come running to read it too.  But this novel I can definitely recommend.  Give it a shot and really good suspense will come your way.

Six months before ""x-day"", the mother of her victim Marlene Dixon suddenly visits and introduces her to Oliver, a young attorney who is willing to help Marlene, herself a high-powered lawyer, seek clemency for Noa. Marlene has had a change of heart and doesn't want to see Noa die. Perhaps life in prison will be a better punishment for the murderer of her only daughter. But what Marlene really wants is the truth.

Written as a prison memoir by Noa, The Execution of Noa P. Singleton by Elizabeth L. Silver takes us back to her early life and the events that set in motion the crime for which Noa was convicted and sentenced to death by the state of Pennsylvania. Brilliant in style, Silver takes the reader into the mind of the convict. Noa is a memorable character, conflicted and sympathetic--who is simultaneously trying to impress with her pretentious vocabulary and metaphors, yet pass herself off as a humble victim of circumstance. Her story of how the girl, once at the top of her high school class and admission into an Ivy League School, ends up on death row is compelling and dramatic and just a bit over-the-top.",3,"[-2.651569420295864, -1.2965997919882033, -1.426868140566312, -1.0031638461838435, -1.1375148691226085]",-1.0031638461838435
400,"Did Ian Fleming want to kill 007 at the end of the previous novel, ""From Russia with Love""?  In the final paragraphs of that book, Rosa Klebb kicks out the deadly poisoned spike in her shoe and jabs Bond before she's thrown into a laundry basket and hustled away by Mathis and his assistants.

So I was curious as to how Fleming would resurrect Bond for the next novel, ""Doctor No.""  He does a decent job of explaining away how 007 survived, but there is no mention of what happened to Tania--which is something I'm curious about as I read the novels this time.  (At the beginning of ""From Russia with Love,"" Fleming describes the demise of Bond's relationship with Tiffany Case from ""Diamonds are Forever"").

Although Bond delivered the girl and the Spektor cipher machine--and survived his encounter with Red Grant, the total psycho killing machine--he's treated as if he screwed up and sent to Jamaica to look into the disappearnce of another agent.  A little job in the sun that shouldn't take much effort.

Well, this is James Bond we're talking about here, so we know he isn't going to get much of a holiday out of the piddling little assignment.

""Doctor No"" has the lean, fluid style that keeps the story moving.  It's set in the Caribbean where Fleming lived and wrote all of the Bond novels.  I focused more on his description of Doctor No while trying to keep the image of the painfully-Caucasian Joseph Wiseman out of my mind (he was the actor who played No in the film version).

I would put this novel in the same category with ""Diamonds are Forever"": a strong action story with a couple of over-the-top moments that, although they worked while reading it, look a little strange with some afterthought.  In ""Diamonds"", it was the Italian gangster who liked to dress up like a cowboy in his own private Wild West town.  In ""Doctor No"", it was the obstacle course and giant octopus fight.

The best novels are ""Casino Royale"", ""Live and Let Die"", and definitely ""From Russia with Love.""

2029,"3.5 stars---A BUCCANEER AT HEART is the second installment in Stephanie Laurenss THE ADVENTURERS QUARTET Regency-era historical romance series. This is Captain Robert Frobisher, and Aileen Hopkins story line. A BUCCANEER AT HEART is best read as part of the 4 book quartet series as each installment builds upon the information and premise of the previous story line(s).

Told from several third person perspectives A BUCCANEER AT HEART focuses on the search for a number of missing children, women and military officers in Freetown, South Africa presumed to have been kidnapped by a band of European slavers. Commissioned to locate the kidnappers camp Captain Robert Frobisher continues his brothers original mission in the hopes of locating the missing people and uncovering the who, what, and why of the people involved. Enter Aileen Hopkins, a twenty seven year old British citizen hoping to locate her missing brother Lieutenant William Hopkins. What ensues is the building relationship between Aileen and Robert, and the struggle to remain neutral in the face of more kidnappings and missing persons.

The relationship between Aileen and Robert is one of mutual concern but our heroine is determined to search for her missing brother regardless of Roberts warnings, and the potential threats from the slavers themselves.  The romance is slow to build as the first part of the story line follows Robert and Aileen on separate investigations into the missing officers, as the author continues to build up the story behind the slavers, the women and children involved. The $ex scenes are intimate without the use of over the top graphic language or text.

There is a large ensemble cast of secondary and supporting characters including a number of Roberts men, the children and citizens of Freetown, South Africa, the political officials in Britain and Freetown, and a cameo by Roberts brothers Captains Declan (The Ladys Command #1) and Caleb Frobisher  (The Daredevil Snared #3).

A BUCCANEER AT HEART has a little bit of everything: action, mystery, suspense, romance and love.

The premise is intriguing; the characters are animated and passionate; the romance is fated and heartwarming.",2,"[-2.4831668537111056, -1.5478162982908754, -1.094273147121729, -1.004117294594577, -1.1875901629772032]",-1.004117294594577

The story is fairly well paced and there is plenty of action and a glimpse into the glamour of the rich who lived well despite blockades and an ongoing war. Politics is always there no matter what.

This novel had so much potential, especially a forbidden interracial romance and we did get some great story bits here and there. Elle undercover as a mute slave in a Confederate household. Elle almost captured by slavers.

However, the story was less about the historical part and more about sex. There wasn't much to call romance. Instead, everything was tinged with sexual tension and the need to act on it that didn't add to the story or make it better.

Elle as a character is terrific. Strong and fearless. Being a free woman and willingly going undercover as a slave and being treated as such? Talk about strength. She had more going for her than Malcolm ever did.

With that said, the insights into the political realm of terrorism and counter-terrorism that were logically presented give so much food for thought, that this book will remain with me for some time.

Is it more moral for a pilot of an attack aircraft to actually be in danger when delivering a killing attack than to be in front of a screen and manipulating the craft as if it were a video game? And, does this extra layer of separation serve as insulation from the reality of death? Further, are all the terrorists who deliver death so randomly to the free world behaving because of a religious conviction, misguided though it is, or are some simply hired guns who do it for the money?

She is a high school teacher with roots firmly planted in New Orleans with her Gram and friends. She doesn't really date or connect with men. She does not do relationships and never quite got over a broken heart.

She never expected to see Mason Coulter again. He left her unexpectedly six years ago without explanation. He is an archaeologist that travels the world. He is still charismatic, handsome, and even more attractive than before. And now he is back and needs her help.

Soon they find themselves on a mission. But they are also finding sexual tension and unresolved feelings that have been buried.

The chances for a positive outcome don't look any better than they did in the past. And neither of them can predict what will happen after the last task is done.

The storm is mostly plot device though. In some ways, the story of Ash and Pia, the city couple who move to a small town, is familiar. The move has been good for most part but fissures start to settle in, then the news of the storm coming and the fissures become chasms.

2908,"Maybelle de Maitenon has a simple plan. She'll seduce a stranger. Once she's lost her virginity, she won't have to worry about any man wanting to hold her, compromise her independence. Then she'll head to Egypt to engage in archeological expeditions--assuming she can find a way to keep her grandmother from going completely nuts with her idea of a school for seduction for London's young bucks. Edmund, sexy Duke of Rutherford, looks like just the thing--and he's got a reputation, so she doesn't have to worry about entanglements. The plan seems perfect.

It seemed like a simple seduction in the garden, but when Edmund realizes he's just deflowered a virgin, everything changes. Things change even more when his mother demands that he do the right thing, marry the girl--even though she's the granddaughter of a famous courtesan and can hardly do his tarnished reputation any good. Still, Maybelle fascinates Edmund. Perhaps if he can enroll in her school, he'll have some great opportunities to explore the attraction without any emotional entanglements. It turns out the one thing he and Maybelle agree upon is that emotional entanglements are bound to destroy their dreams.

Author Delilah Marvelle creates a sparkling debut with MISTRESS OF PLEASURE. Maybelle is charmingly different from the standard Regency/Victorian heroine with her family background and French ancestory. Edmund has everything he needs to be the fantasy hero--wealth, looks, a deep injury that can only be healed by the right woman's love. Marvelle puts the two together, cementing the relationship with sizzling sex and clever scenes within the 'school for scandal.' If anything, a couple of the other 'students' in the school threaten to steal Edmund's thunder. I'll definitely be looking forward to learning how the others make out in their attempts to resolve their own issues.

9753,"Frankly, in the past I have not been all that impressed with Science Diet/Hill's brand pet foods.  I am VERY impressed with their marketing, but when it comes down to ingredients and value, not so much.  Hill's has historically been the prescription-food side of Science Diet, for cats with special dietary needs, but the cats I've fed it to would rather die than eat it.

The Hill's Ideal Balance is changing my mind about all that.  The ingredients are good, whole foods such as chicken (that's right, chicken, not chicken by-products or chicken flavor, and it's right up front as the first ingredient), egg, peas, apples, and rice, and the cats eat it eagerly.  I'd probably dispute the need for cats to eat things like apples and rice, but Hill's goal was to create a food that offers 100% balanced nutrition, so these may have played a part in that (it's also full of supplements to achieve that balance, so I suspect not).

The price of this food is not as high as it first appears.  The nutrition is excellent and, again, is achieved with quality ingredients.  Moreover, the suggested feeding amounts are less than foods containing cheap, non-nutritious fillers.

One of the things I always have liked about the Hill's prescription diets is their money-back guarantee.  I was happy to see that this over-the-counter food continues that policy, so it's pretty risk-free for your cat to try this.  If you like the convenience of dry cat food, Hill's Ideal Balance is well worth taking a look at.",3,"[-3.5358036201195517, -1.2196605982128021, -1.1492268135527064, -1.0065398781285049, -1.1023983469644438]",-1.0065398781285049
9202,"Paul Newman plays Luke, a charismatic man stuck in a chain gang for breaking parking meters. The authority automatically has a problem with him for this petty crime and he spends the entire movie doing what he has done his whole life: being Cool Hand Luke. Cool Hand Luke does his manual labor with zeal and Cool Hand Luke takes insane bets. Cool Hand Luke doesn't give up. This is his one major flaw, because the authorities want to break Luke's spirit which cannot be broken. Herein lies the point of the film.

Sure, Luke is a rebel, but his failure to conform is not thrown at the audience as if it were a message. The events just happen; Luke just happens. This makes for a much more realistic movie and a much more likable character.

Luke could be compared to James Dean's character in Rebel Without a Cause, but that comparison would be flawed. Dean's character is much younger in age and in spirit. Luke has been hardened by age and experience; he was probably very similar to Dean's character in youth but has quieted down a bit. In consequence, Luke is less whiney and more to-the-point.

Cool Hand Luke is a popular film because the character is one that people can relate to and respect immensely. If anyone has known someone similar, one can relate to this statement. Luke is the type of person that everyone wants to be but often fails to become.

One incident put a strain on their easy going friendship. But now at Winterfest in their hometown of Abbott Springs, they have a chance to reconnect and deal with the fall out.
Both are afraid of rejection and ruining their long time friendship, but at the same time want more. But they walk a fine line between need and fear both in relationships and what they want to do with their future.

But they were struggling not only with what they wanted with each other,but also what their next step was in their own lives. She often put her faith in the wrong people and took chances, while he made safe choices. But despite their issues getting on the same page regarding their romantic relationship, they know each other so well that they each can see the other's flaws and strengths that could change their future path and are really the only ones that can encourage the other to branch out. It is a journey of self discovery for them both in various ways.

9456,"Fear not--although ""Margin Call"" focuses on events that precipitated the current economic meltdown, this movie is NOT about economics or arcane government policies. A knowledge of mortgage-backed securities is not required in order for you to enjoy this movie, If, however, you enjoy compelling performances in a tightly-paced, intelligently written and emotionally powerful movie, you'll enjoy this film.  An especially intriguing aspect of this movie is that it remains keenly focused on the three classical Aristotelian unities of drama: unity of action (the story remains centered on the imminent demise of the American economy), unity of place (the vast majority of the action occurs within one firm's corporate office), and unity of time (all of the action takes place in one 24-hour period.). The film's crowning achievement is its ability to depict the human drama, anxiety, and uncertainty that led to and resulted from the economic mess we're all coping with today. ""Margin Call"" belongs to a very rare genre--the economic thriller--and it succeeds mainly due to its brilliant script (by writer/director J.C. Chandor) and the mesmerizing performances of Kevin Spacey, Stanley Tucci, Paul Bettany, Zachary Quinto, Jeremy Irons, and Penn Badgley.

Sheriff Walt Longmire is about to be a grandfathervery soon.  He has promised his daughter, Cady, that he will be in Philadelphia for the babys birth.  His old friend and former boss, Lucian Connally, asks him for a favor of going with him to an adjacent county and visit a woman whose daughter is missing.  One missing woman leads to secrets, corruption and possible death.

Johnson is the epitome of a story teller.  You are not a viewer; you are a participant.  How does he do it?  He starts by hooking you into the story from the very beginning by his strong voice and the ability to create a very visual sense of place.  He makes you feel and see what he describes.  His inclusion of spiritualism adds to the sense of place, the strength of the character and the story.

Part of that voice is his humor.  Its not situational, but dry and natural.  His dialogue is among the best being written.  Most of it is his characters.  Walt is such an engaging character.  He is truly the long arm of the law and well-liked by his colleagues.  But hes not infallible nor is he superman.  The supporting characters of Henry Standing Bear and Undersheriff Vic Moretti, Lucian and Dog are significant to the story.  Best of all, even the secondary characters are well developed.  None of Johnsons characters are flat or stereotypes.  They all have a part to play in the effectiveness of the story.  Even the weather becomes a character within the story.

Any Other Name is an excellent book. Its filled with tension and breath-catching suspense, but the pacing is perfect with enough pauses in the action for balance.  Johnson is an author who both entertains you and educates you.  Theres not a single wrong step to be found.

I liked this story but I didn't love it. There was just TOO much crammed into one book. Ritualistic killings, kidnapping, a plethora of suspects and then a heavy dose of the supernatural on top of all that. Some of the elements could have been cut and made a much cleaner story.

It's a very interesting collection of stories from Holmes and I enjoyed most of them. I wasn't entirely impressed with the first few short stories because they didn't capture my attention. However, that being said, they were still full of honesty and humor.

The last half of the book was much better for me. I really liked the stories and couldn't wait to keep reading more. I really think the one story told from the perspective of a dog was one of my favorites! Crazy, right?! I wasn't sure if I'd actually like that one because I've never read anything from an animal's perspective, but it was a lot of fun. The namesake of this book, Barbara the Slut, was another great story that I wish I had more of. I really liked her character and wish I knew how her life turned out! She's a fun girl! And the story about the law school graduate working at a sex toy store? So much fun.

Even though the first few stories weren't my favorite, I really enjoyed this book. It makes me want to pick up some more short stories and start reading The Art of Racing in the Rain (a book from a dog's perspective that has been on my shelf for too long).

1104,"""Ava's Man"" is a loving tribute to Rick Bragg's maternal grandfather, written in his trademark spare, elegant prose.  It is also a paean to the rural South and to a vanished way of life. In the southern tradition of looking to the past, Bragg has reconstructed the short, difficult, meaningful life of Charlie Bundrum.  He must have relied heavily on the memories of his mother, Margaret, who was perhaps the neediest of Charlie's brood, and thus the closest to her father.
  Charlie was a man who was fiercely protective of his eight children, and a hard-working father who would do just about anything to provide for them.  He died at 51, worn out from long years of labor, and suffering from a liver ailment caused by decades of drinking moonshine.
  Having just reviewed ""...and Ladies of the Club"", this reviewer cannot help contrasting the southern culture Bragg describes with the midwestern, community-minded society of that book.  Few men of Charlie's era in that society died so young. The midwest is filled with long-lived descendants of the Germans and Scandinavians who first populated the area.  This is just one of the many north/south differences which will become apparent as you read Bragg's book.

  Charlie was a proud, independent man, in the Jeffersonian tradition.  Family came first in his hardscrabble life, although he was charitable, taking in an outcast older man who lived with the family for many years. Bragg has done a wonderful job of fleshing out the grandfather he never knew. In ""Ava's Man"" you will find it easy to look beyond the southern stereotypes to find
the real man, Charlie Bundrum.  Highly recommended!",4,"[-2.451084069211829, -1.2424074098217437, -1.4140698238239864, -1.00967955844937, -1.0140728610797871]",-1.00967955844937

Claire Hadley, 22, has had a crush on her older brothers best friend since she was sixteen when she took a chance on him and it left her heartbroken and pissed off.  Razer Bennington, 29, is a former marine trying his hardest to resist the girl who gets him hard and steals his heart.  His allegiance to her brothers and family is proving to be a real test the more determined Claire gets at finally having the man of her literal dreams.

Both characters were very likable. Claire is innocently cute, determined, and spunky. Razer is one dirty talking hottie whos being pulled in two directions by his love and attraction to the girl and his respect and loyalty to the people that were there for him growing up.

Told via Claire and Razers alternating first person POV, the story is upbeat, fun, and incredibly sexy (seriously hot) as the two negotiate their supposedly limited time back in their hometown.

It was refreshing that the romance focused on the light-hearted inner drama between Claire and Razer and her family with a few good twists and reveals as the story neared its close, and it wraps on a very sweet note.  Prick Tease is a stand-alone although the later parts certainly hint at future books for her family.

types. For instance, Type A is the agrarian which is comfortable with grains and livestock. Blood type B people require a
balanced diet of meat and dairy. (B-Antigen)  Type AB is the modern man with an inherited tolerance of AB with enhanced
abilities to manufacture more antibodies. (A & B antigen) The blood type is key to the immune system. Blood type 0 persons have no antigens. (Anti-A and Anti-B antibodies) Type B people may have milk ; whereas, Type A people tend to have systems which agglutinate and reject it.

The author mentions an Indican urine scale for bowel putrification; wherein, the liver and intestines do not metabolize proteins. Instead; they produce indols- toxic byproducts on the Indican Scale. Foods with toxic Indicans should be avoided.  i.e. Bologna  magnifies nitrites. Lactin activity inflames the intestines, causes bloating and slows food metabolism. Wheat gluten slows the
metabolism and interferes with insulin efficiency.

Kelp, seafood, liver, kale, spinach,broccolli and red meat are ideal for metabolism and weight loss/stabilization. Bacon, ham, pork, American cheese, cheddar and ice cream should be minimized. Soy may be utilized as a good alternate to the dairy group. Flax oil and olive oil are beneficial. Corn oil and peanut oil should be avoided. Type B persons have stronger immune systems and may eat meat, green veggies, eggs, liver, licorice tea and ginger. Type AB persons benefit from TOFU, dairy , green veggies and millet.
Persons with sinusitis and Type B should avoid fenugreek. Type O persons should avoid alfalfa. Type B persons react badly to vaccines. Type A persons should avoid cayenne due to potential nausea. Type O and B should avoid aloe vera juice.

Lina (Fontaine) is returning home on the train when she meets the suave, charming, rogue John (Johnnie) Aysgarth (Cary Grant).  He is going fox hunting and sees her again.  He uses his charms to meet her again.  Lina is completely taken by him even though her parents dislike his reputation.  He finally calls her and they meet at the Fox Hunt Ball.

It's a whirlwind romance and marriage.  Johnnie wants to prove that he has reformed and takes a job.  One day Johnnie's old friend Binky (Nigel ""Dr. Watson"" Bruce) and mentions that he saw Johnnie at the race track.  Lina starts to get suspicious of Johnnie.  Things are missing around the house.

One day Lina is out shopping and runs into her old friend Isobelle Lenke, an author of murder mysteries.  She also runs into a couple of missing chairs at the pawn shop.  Johnnie arrives home; he backed the winner at the races.  He has won 2,000.  He admits that he used the chairs for the stake.

Isobelle comes for dinner and Johnnie starts asking her about her books and ways of killing people.  This of course makes Lina even more suspicious.

Things get worse when Binky has an accident and dies.  She starts to fear that she is next.

This was a breakout movie for Grant.  Johnnie is a complex role. He is both good and bad. This role helped him break out of his romantic lead role for more interesting roles.

For Fontaine, this was not a great stretch.  She had just played a similar role in Hitchcock's Rebecca.  But she was stunning in her control of character.

I've read scores of these types of books, and ""The Purpose Driven Life"" is different in several ways. First, it offers you a step-by-step plan for creating a sense of meaning in your life. Second, it's based in scripture. Third, it advocates making the church the center of your life.

These differences can also be the book's drawbacks. I always sensed that the author had a bit of an agenda -- being a pastor of a huge church, of course he believes in the importance and sanctity of organized religion. But what if you aren't a member of a church? What if your church is dysfunctional? What if you feel called to do things outside your church?

I for one believe that God has given us different talents and different strengths and different passions. SOME of us are called to serve in the church. And some of us are called elsewhere. Warren seems to ignore those of us who are pulled to serve others and use our talents outside of our church. After reading this book twice (once on my own and once through a small-group study through my church), I was still left with many, many questions -- and a deep-seated feeling that there was more to life than what Warren had presented.",2,"[-2.089362653416032, -1.425792111337865, -1.237847761410743, -1.0119643997996834, -1.1012596527352145]",-1.0119643997996834

Siegel does write interesting, enjoyable legal thrillers.  It is a series I feel should be read in order to understand the characters and their relationships with each other, although the author does a good job of providing background for each of the main characters within each book.

Mike, the protagonist, is the narrator.  You not only see the story unfold from his perspective but ""hear"" what's in his head as well as what he says aloud.  This is both amusing and, occasionally, annoying and I would like to see more growth in the character.

I did enjoy seeing how Mike put the case together, the investigation behind it, the relationship between him and Rose; his ex-wife, law partner, mother of his children and now girlfriend. There are some great secondary characters and very good suspense.

3445,"I can honestly say that Dev is one of my absolute favorite fictional private investigators. He's just your average, typical male with all the bells and whistles eternal bachelorhood brings. What I enjoy most about reading Dev Haskell novels, is that the author doesn't deviate from Dev's character, and his continuous pattern of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, so you know what to expect when you meet up with him in the next book. His behavior - which often invokes a good measure of eye-rolling in the reader - is predictable, yet strangely endearing. The only thing that differs in each novel is the kinds of trouble he get into. And you can bet your last dollar, there's always a woman involved. This, of course, makes for some laugh-out-loud, light reading. In par with the previous Dev Haskell novels, the author continues Dev's misadventures using a well-known cast of supporting characters familiar to readers of these novels. What makes these characters really memorable is their realistically relatable flaws.

The only disappointed here for me was that I could tell very early on who the culprit was going to be, and the motive behind it all. I was hoping to be wrong, but as it turns out, my guess was right all along - thus the four-star rating.

I chose my time fortuitously as, the documentary was airing on PBS as I was finishing the book.

Half the Sky  deals with many human rights issues which effect the health, life and welfare of women worldwide, from human trafficking to FGM, to fistulas, to rape, to education and neglect of female children's health.  While the truth of the situation presented by Kristof and WuDunn is beyond bleak, we are also presented with success stories and introduced to warriors for causes that cause us to hope that life doesn't have to be so precarious for women and change can be implemented in which women and girls can lift their lives out of despair.

I was impressed watching the PBS broadcast to see the way Nicholas Kristof works.  He asks difficult and pointed questions to gather the information he needs to get a picture of what is happening both in the lives of the individual women and the situation they find themselves in.  Kristof also takes careful notes and this adds authenticity to what is written in the book.

This is an important work which has brought to light the horror of the condition in which many women and children live throughout the world.  And as important it offers a message of hope which has galvanized people to act in ways which will impact their lives for the better.

Pros:
Access Point - This is the default mode and worked perfectly in all my tests.  This mode is this unit's main asset and makes it so you can use tablets and smart phones on Wi-Fi.  In addition, you could use this mode at home for guests so you don't have to give out your main password/etc.  Almost a brainless setup in AP mode.  I could get this to operate quickly when using it out of the box in the default Access Point (AP) mode.

Cons:
Repeater Mode - Repeater mode didn't seem to work for me.  After setting it up, it looked successful on the router's web menu page.  However, I used a Wi-Fi channel scanner on both my Android phone and laptop and there was no noticeable difference in the signal I was trying to boost.  Disappointing as this was the mode I was most hoping to use this router for.
Minor Cons:
Bridge Mode - Seems to let you use ONLY the same channel as the parent router.  This is sort of logical since the internal WR700N radio can only use one channel at a time.  If it had 2 radios, it could obviously upload on one and download on the other.  While this mode is still useful, it is not as useful as if it could use a different channel than the bridged signal.

So much futuristic that an aircraft carrier, that as far as I know was struggling to make sea trials is on location in Asian seas.  The story revolves around drone technology, some may already exist or at least are in the works.  The whole plot rocks and I for one am a big supporter of the concept.  Some observations: the nuclear reactors are a new concept for me, as I went through the US Navy Nuclear Power program and then on to serve aboard two different nuclear submarines.  I am a fan of PWR (pressurized water reactors), but certainly open to newer and cheaper technology after someone proves it to me.  I have been aboard new USNS Sealift Command ships and while they are impressive, including the Captains stateroom they are nothing like the opulence described in this story. Drones have been in use for a good while, although nothing on the scale described.  And finally, a woman POTUS.  A story that grabs you with an iron grip, unfortunately the proof reading was sloppy but not to the point of distracting from the story.  The extraordinary use of the drones minus the boring details of their construction allows the story to flow easily, captivating the imagination.  To think a drone can be used to slip into a country, poison a terrorist thug and slip out all unseen should have military contractors scrambling.  I have heard there are currently drones the size of flies that are in use as spies.  More complex than just a story about drones the characters involved are themselves an interesting tale, plotters, schemers, politicians, military leaders and the lives of a conglomeration personnel from varying backgrounds, many with a tragic past.  Finally, I think the idea of using sneaky devious little machines to slip in and destroy a supply of weapons of mass destruction, all unobserved, and leaving no fingers of accusation to be pointed is genius as opposed to at least one allied country using fighter bombers to just flat out unapologetically fly in and destroy the weapons that would destroy them.

1634,"There have been quite a few books written about the lives of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, but it is safe to say no one writes these historical biographies quite like Stephen E. Ambrose.  The advantage with reading Ambrose is you get the entire story and then some!

Ambrose does not begin with the first steps Lewis took towards the Pacific, but the many steps involved in his succession as Captain, the development of his friendship with Thomas Jefferson, and what led to Clark joining Lewis on this most historic journey.  And with the detail that Ambrose uses with Lewis and Clark's travail across the American West, one cannot help but feel it is really taking years to get through this lengthy book.

The advantage of the audiobook is that apart from being very mobile, one feels, as they list to these well-read words, that he or she is really waling along with Lewis and Clark, listening to them chatter amongst themselves, watching as Lewis writes his journal, playing a lead role in the fights that place between the members of the party, and what led to the specific decisions that were taken.

My only complaint really would be that Ambrose goes a little too far with his depth, as the book carries on fro quite a few pages after Lewis' suicide, to the extend that the author rehashes what he has already told the reader, and reveals points of character about Lewis that the reader certainly already knows.  Nevertheless, plowing through this book is much like the journey Lewis and Clark took: it is long and hard, but a historical journey that the reader will never forget.

7545,"I received the opportunity to try this power supply.

I have used Corsair power supplies for the last number of years, so it is a product I am familiar with and use regularly.

1.  What's in the box?:  In a pretty heavy box (power bricks are heavy), you receive the power supply (well-wrapped), plus instructions, a power chord and various connectors for the computer.

2.  Set-up?:  Beyond placing this beast in the computer, this was pretty straightforward as a device.  Compared to my other 600W supply, this box was a bit larger in depth.  The dimensions as to the fit didn't change, but the box sat a bit longer than other supply boxes I have used.

Set-up is basically consistent of plugging the nicely braided cables to the various needs.  This is a modular item, so the user only needs to used what is needed.

Assuming most users will have a custom set-up, this need will vary depending on use.  The cables can be a bit tough to maneuver around, but not overly tough.  I have not found the cables to be too stiff.

3.  Use?:  Once plugged in, the power supply worked fine.  I would characterize my current rig as probably a lower middle capability system.  750 watts is a lot of power and will not overtax the supply. I have been using a 550 Watt system which has been plenty for my rig. The supply fan has not gone off during the most I could throw at the system.  This is expected as I understand.  The 750 Watt system has not been taxed at all according to my power app I have. Likewise, I have never seen either fan work.

________________________

At this point, the supply works well and easily.  I am planning to build a new system within the next 90 days as luck would have it.  At that point, I will use this supply in that system and will report the findings.

So far, however, things seem to be excellent.  I really like the Corsair power supplys and this model is no exception at this point.

As expected, the 750Watt model providers plenty of power for most situations.  For my current rig, it is a beast that provides plenty of power.

I am building a new system, and I expect once I place this supply in that rig that it will be a similar experience.",3,"[-2.0465113678639177, -1.7260176259083948, -1.0701209632735353, -1.0144141942745337, -1.204641044973118]",-1.0144141942745337

729,"OK, I was also fooled by the blurb - thinking it was a case where a father had been forced into an outrageous ""game"" by some madman.  So yes, I was surprised (and disappointed) when the true nature of the situation became known.  Where to start?

For one, the author freely admits that the main purpose of his writing was to excite, to stimulate, to capture the reader with non-stop action. Besides action, though, you need a coherent, somewhat logical storyline, not one that is rescued through the most impossible/improbable/moronic actions.  In this case, our hero - widowed empathetic loving father doctor - is transported from his kitchen with cute, smartass daughter into the New York Public Library for a galactic ""Contest"" held every 1,000 years. Why aliens from parts unknown choose to use Earth time is never explained (LOL) but let's get on with the show.

Our hero questions his mentor (bald headed, typical alien who speaks perfect English) and learns that sure enough, he must battle six aliens and the LAST GUY/CREATURE remaining wins. Of course he must also save darling daughter.  He is lucky in that (1) Several policemen have been trapped in the building which has been surrounded by a decidedly un-alien electronic barrier, (2) One of the creatures befriends our heros and (3) whenever one of the creatures moves in for the kill they stop, talk, meditate, whatever, giving our hero time to escape.  Oh, and for an added bonus, a huge monster has also been added to the game. Despite the inclusion of a schematic of the place, there is not a shred of coherence in the flow of the action - elevators everywhere, large rooms, big bookshelves, etc.

A side story - secret govt folks figure out that the electronic barrier is from aliens(!!) - interjects itself every now and then.

(I didn't see either one in a theatre since just about everyone told me that, if I saw the trailer, I saw the coolest parts of both movies).

ARMAGEDDON is a meteorite disaster flick from a guy's point of view.  The underdog rascals are sent into space to destroy the meteorite after much testosterone antics and posturing.  The chick (Liv Tyler) is hot.  It's a cowboy enterprise.

DEEP IMPACT is the same movie but from a woman's point of view.  The world is about ready to end, but Tea Leoni tries to come to grips with her troubled relationship with her dad.  People hug, make sacrifices, deal with emotions.

To be honest, I liked DEEP IMPACT better.  Even though it was the more laid back of the two, it was also more thoughtful and interesting.

1994,"*I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.

The story grabbed my attention right away in the first few sentences. Its a fast-paced read that blends sexual tension, mystery, the real-life disaster of Katrina, and fantasy elements like wizardry and voodoo gods.

I don't know if Suzanne Johnson had firsthand experience with the devastation caused by Katrina, but it seemed like she did. I thought she did an excellent job of showing the psychological and social factors that contributed to people staying instead of evacuating. The descriptions of the damage done by the levee breaches was excellent. I also appreciated how she showed that it wasn't just people affected by Katrina. Animals were displaced, too.

I thought it was really creative to extend the idea of breaches to the supernatural world. Katrina caused tears in the veil between the Mundane (our) world and what Johnson calls the Beyond. I also enjoyed how Johnson took the time to describe the rituals D.J. performs to make potions, transports, etc. It makes it seem more real.

Royal Street is such an entertaining book. There is a little humor and silliness mixed in, which is helpful given the depressing setting and circumstances. The mysteries about the ritual murders and Gerrys disappearance also kept me glued to the pages. When it all came together, it made sense. There weren't any loose ends. The story was wrapped up very well.

I only have two minor complaints, both of which have to do with overused tropes. One is that D.J. gives her staff a name. The other is that the book has an Alice in Wonderland reference, which is so overused that it is starting to become one of my biggest pet peeves.

I don't think either of those things are worth taking off stars for, because I loved this book as a whole. I thought it was very well written and creative. I give it 5 stars. Im already reading the next book in the series and I love it! I strongly recommend Royal Street to readers of urban fantasy who like less romance and more mystery.",4,"[-3.9410951281319417, -1.466155734209047, -1.3025107550547328, -1.0157865574838276, -1.031694303916618]",-1.0157865574838276

It becomes a race against time to find a treatment before there is an epidemic of a terrible disease and it's a matter of days before 12/21/12. This is the date on which some people believe our civilization will disappear just like the Mayan kingdoms did centuries before.

Each chapter of this book is exciting from beginning to end. The story switches between Chel and her team frantically trying to decipher the codex and Gabe concentrating on possible treatments. I quickly became immersed in the story and connected with the characters of Gabe and Chel.

647,"So now I finally know why Jack Reacher is a loner. Out there in the world with a toothbrush, a military pension and some cash to buy new clothes that he wears for a short time. This book explains how the famous Jack Reacher got there and it's a wild ride of a plot.

Jack Reacher is sent to a small town where a woman has been killed in a gruesome manner. Did someone on the local Army base commit the crime? Who is trying to cover up the crime? Reacher has to deal with the Pentagon and its bureaucracy and deal with a good looking sheriff (surprise, surprise, huh?) in the town that Reacher is not sure he can trust at first, but later? Well.....let's just say they trust each other a lot and when that midnight train goes through town? Well, I'll let you read the steamy scenes (and there is more than one midnight train going through town).

The plot is solid for most of the book. Additional people are found dead and previous cases now appear to link with current cases, but can he trust the sheriff who was a Marine herself? What is she hiding? There were moments that I loved this book, but then there were moments that I thought the book went awry (i.e. the local country bums who carried guns and acted like soldiers was a bit silly in my opinion) and the reasons for Reacher finally leaving the military are still not quite clicking with me.

It's a good read. I think it's one of Child's better books, but I can't give it more than 4 stars because of some of the ""over the top"" stuff in the book and an ending that left me a bit disappointed.",3,"[-4.164800660702227, -1.8286686462809447, -1.2110863913677243, -1.0196163282880264, -1.1871624768094293]",-1.0196163282880264

They eat this pasta happily without complaints although they usually don't like to eat vegetables. Nevertheless, I find the veggie claim is a little deceptive since only 25% of the veggie content is tomato and carrot, while the remaining 75% is wheat. There are hardly any greens in the pasta neither. It doesn't seem like a good, balanced source of vegetables. You will probably want to supplement it with a nice mix of vegetables as a side.

Overall, this is an interesting pasta product with a small amount of non-leafy vegetables added to it. It's easy to cook and tastes great.

268,"I have thoroughly enjoyed EVERY book written by Shelley Shepard Gray, and this book was no exception. Upon picking it up from my mailbox, I had this  compelling urge to read it immediately!! However, that was not to be, as we were preparing for a vacation in Lancaster County, PA. BUT, I did read the novel, while in Amish country. How appropriate to hear the horses and buggies travelling down the road, as I read this Amish tale.

Right from the first chapter, I was intrigued with the main characters. They had very real problems that presented  challenges that  seemed to be insurmountable in the Amish faith.  Christina became a friend who I wanted to enfold in my arms and assure that everything would work out just fine, if she waited for God to work on His plan for her life. Aden proves to be an honest, caring individual who any girl would love to have for her partner in life. But was that to ever to be possible???  Would he wait for that still, quiet voice?  This couple had a very different and yes, difficult relationship. Could they overcome the odds?

The plot was well developed and had just the right amount of suspense alongside the growing romance to keep the reader interested. The topic of adoption and caring for an orphan was dealt with in a sensitive, realistic manner. Being thankful for what you have and are given is the theme throughout the book. Also addressed, is the topic of fostering a child of a different race. These twists and turns in the plot really made me think of all I have and should be thankful for. We all need to stop and think of how blessed we really are!!

Definitely a five star book!! Book Two of the ""Return to Sugarcreek"" Series is one that you do not want to miss. Totally different slant on events in the Amish community!

I actually liked Javier and liked the mystery throughout the book about did he still have feelings for Elie or was she always just a pawn. It somehow always seemed like both to me.

685,"The Subtle Knife picks up pretty much where The Golden Compass left off.  At the end of the previous book, Lord Asriel had created an opening between worlds.  Lyra passes through and finds herself in what appears to be a deserted world and a deserted city called Cittagazze.  She walks through the streets and enters a cafe and no one is around.  Cittagazze is a place where Specters steal the souls from adults, so all surviving adults have fled.  Children can't see the Specters and are left alone until they get old enough.

While scouting the city, Lyra finds Will Parry, a boy without a daemon.  He is also an outsider to this new world, fleeing his own after accidentally killing a man.  The man was ransacking his house, looking for old correspondence between his mother and father. Will stumbled upon the new world by accident, but it has him wondering about how his father diassapeared so many years ago.  Will is determined to find the truth about his father and Lyra is happy to help him.  Together they venture between worlds and discover an object of great power, the subtle knife.  Lyra continues to be pursued by Mrs. Coulter and Will continues to be pursued by the people that want information on his father.  They will both have to be smart and brave to succeed in their quests.

I really enjoyed this book, even more than The Golden Compass.  I think it has to do in part to the fact that I was already immersed in Lyra's world.  I knew about daemons, the alethiometer (compass), and Dust.  In this book, we start out in the human world, Will's home world.  We get to see him discover a new world and Lyra, a person with a daemon.  We get to see Lyra discover a person without a daemon and all the oddities of the human world.  As they discuss and learn about each other, it makes clear what some of the terms in The Golden Compass meant and their relation to the human world.  There continued to go be great adventure in this book and great danger.  I enjoyed learning of the subtle knife and it's importance.  It will be interesting to see what The Amber Spyglass has to add to the mix.

Really a weird way to start out a crime thriller novel. Author A.E. Howe's first book in his Larry Macklin series has an odd protagonist to say the least. The sheriff of Adams County is Ted Macklin. Ted is Larry's father. Along with his out of shape and unmotivated partner Pete Henley, the bored Larry seems to be just going through the motions day by day. Late one night on patrol the pair come across the body of Mark Kemper laying in a ditch the victim of a really gruesome murder. Kemper 51, seems to be an enigma to this small town. Larry runs into dead end after dead end researching Kemper's past. However Larry does seem to discover a pattern when he discovers Mark was gay and went to high school in Adams back in the 1970's. A recent 70's class reunion has also seemed to be a clue to Kemper's murder. Sheriff Ted also attended the reunion but doesn't see the pattern starting to arise from the late 70's in Adams County. At time I thought this was a pretty good read. Then at times it really frustrated me. The plot twists thrown in to confuse the reader just didn't work . Also I thought the characters needed more substance. The supporting characters didn't support very much. Ted's great dane ""Mauser"" and Larry's inept ability to chat up a girl he has a crush on do seem to get annoying in this tale.

Some are quite humorous, like the ones wanting to know how to find a vampire because they want to be a vampire or at least have the great sex vampires are known for, or how do you tell your husband you are a werewolf, etc. (Questions kind of like Dear Abby would be asked if she were a supernatural being!) The vampire king and the alpha male werewolf from her pack don't like her announcing to the world she is a werewolf (you'd be surprised at how many people believe her without any proof at all). Someone hires a hitman to get rid of her so there is a lot of mystery to the story. Not much sex but a lot of whining at first because Kitty is a timid werewolf and the lowest member of the pack. Her whining irritated me at first but soon I saw Kitty as the strong character she was and after that I just pictured her as a maltese instead of a wolf (since I'm used to hearing my maltese whine when she wants something). Kitty doesn't remain low on the pack number list for  long though since she eventually settles up with the werewolf who turned her. Not a lot of foul language as in some of these series and the pace is rapid and you are rooting for Kitty all the way through the book.

Cats are creatures of habit and she has always preferred ground cat food (preferably poultry flavored). When you give her this type of canned food, with the gravy and the bits, all she does is lap up the gravy and leave the bits in the bowl. But I am sure there are other cats out there who will enjoy this food--to each cat, his/her own. It's always worth trying out a new healthy food alternative for your pet, but, ultimately, it is up to their own particular preferences on whether they will actually eat! That's a pretty small price to pay for all of the love they give us.

UPDATE 10/31/2017: I recently had the opportunity to try the Wellness Grain Free Tuna with Gravy entree for my cat.

' ""The crew member you're replacing was Sid Black,"" Trin said. ""He was part of an away team to Longran Seven, which is an ice planet. While exploring an abandoned ice city, the away team was attacked by ice sharks. They carried Sid off. He wasn't seen again.""

Let me start with the title - it's not a very accurate one for the story.  The cover/title combo makes me think this should be some superpower laden action romp.  It's more 28 Days Later meets The Walking Dead but way less interesting.  Melanie is a hungry (read zombie) but she's high functioning and more human than most of the hungries which is why she's in a facility with a bunch of other kid hungries.  Things go wonky, Melanie ends up out in the world along with her crush/teacher Miss Justineau, Doctor Caldwell who only wants to dissect her, Sergeant Parks the military muscle, and recruit Private Gallagher.  Their goal - to reach civilization by going through hungry infested lands.

See, it's a road trip!  With zombies!  And generally one dimensional characters.  Melanie could be super interesting but the story skips between characters and their various journeys so often that it's hard to get a solid bead on most of them.  There's also a lot of tell not show going on in the dense writing.  The beginning is very slow to get into.  Events and circumstances pick up but never with more than a marginal interest.  The conclusion was more a relief for the fact of meaning I'd finished the book than actual events.

It is 1963 again, and Jeff is young and full of memories of the events of the next 25 years, like who won the World Series. Jeff lives a very different life the second time around, financially secure and health-conscious. However, he dies at 43 again.

And Again. And Again.

Together they find love and try to change the future world they remember. Jeff and Pamela's journey to enlightenment reminds us of the joy in simple things and the beauty of life.

The concept is fascinating, but the writing seems alternately stilted or excessively descriptive of mechanical processes which do not enlighten us about the characters, merely their movements. Jeff's ambitions seem like puerile misogynist male fantasies at times, but the book kept me turning pages to find out what ultimately happens to him.

Because... who DOESN'Tget excited about a novel set in Milwaukee?

I josh (therefore I am); It's the new Jack Reacher novel

Jack Reacher, who is NOT a short Scientologist, is one of the major heroes of the late 20th/21st century

EVERY Reacher is a must read, but, to be Orwellian about it, some are more must-read than others!

This one is wayyy up there

And if some of the surprises Child has in store (and NOBODY does surprises within a series better) are a little darker, a little stronger, than you might want (Child seems to feel the might even be off-putting, he should have mure faith) you'll still be glad you didn't miss this",4,"[-4.2342343671141816, -1.0887304804061317, -1.0997054546298268, -1.0448045865043791, -1.1286985163266818]",-1.0448045865043791
9671,"This came as a 'for review' item from G7. I've tried out and reviewed several G7 bulbs over the last year but G7 never-ever asked or even implied that a 'good' review was expected in exchange.

It is meant to fit into a recessed 6"" light socket and, while large, the flattened top design helps it fit in well. The output light is a steady and pleasant 3000K 'soft white', not unlike what comes out of a 'soft white' incandescent bulb. Besides the obvious power savings that come with LEDs that could actually save money eventually, I can think of a few more good reasons to 'go LED' at this time:

- It's dimmable and, while not cheap, I believe that most dimmable fluorescents of this output are as expensive if not more. G7 recommends that you do not mix brands of dimmable LEDs on the same switch.
- LEDs have no mercury so it's one less thing to worry about if this ever fails.
- The 10 year replacement warranty appears to be quite reasonable.
- It appears to be a good quality, well engineered product.
- Turns on/off instantly, unlike CFLs.
- Causes no harmful radio interference and it's operation is not affected by outside interference.

Of course, there are tradeoffs and they are: size, weight and price. While it does fit into a recessed lighting socket, this item is significantly larger and heavier than either an incandescent or a CFL. As for the price, it speaks for itself. LED prices do seem to be on a downward trend.

I happen to believe that the LEDs are the future of illumination and G7's products are all well engineered, nicely packaged, quality products. Getting this G7 product is probably as good as you can get for your money today if you factor in 'quality' and 'design'.",4,"[-1.0566957918161846, -1.147533857654739, -1.4281144257538843, -1.0549305755611917, -1.1913617716003757]",-1.0549305755611917
