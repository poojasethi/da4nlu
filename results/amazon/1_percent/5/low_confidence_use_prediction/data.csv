The removable egg attachment is too floppy, which drops a star.  The whole unit gets very hot and takes quite a while to cool down.  A floppy middle section can be dangerous.  It has to sit open to cool off.  Update to this paragraph:  I got the hang of this and don't have a problem with any of the parts.  I keep it on its own silicone trivet.  Close the lid and lift by the back foot and hinge where it's not hot.  Easy to move.  Very easy to remove the middle section and toss in soapy water to soak.  Wipe out the top and bottom plates and any gunk I slopped on it.

I'm experimenting with different kinds of bread.  I like is the Thomas English muffins.  They're so tiny and flimsy, though, they don't hold the egg, cheese, ham well.  I can't find the Thomas sandwich size.  The Thos bagel thins are pretty bad tasting.  I found some wonderful sourdough bread loaves she cuts about 3/4"" thick.  Perfection.

Bought the dual sandwich maker, too, for baking biscuits to use as the bread.  I haven't experimented in other sandwich recipes, except grilled cheese.  That turned out quite good.  I think I made a sandwich on the bottom and one on the top section.

I received this book in return for an honest review. This is so good from the start till the end. This starts off pretty much where House of Kings left off. Gosh I do not know what to say, so I don't spoil it.
Well what she was told about Ian, well she learns the truth.
What Alivia had to go through to wait for her trial was hard, it was sad. What she had to go through to wait yet again for the trail to continue, it broke my heart. I felt so heart broken for Alivia because the kings cruelty it's just too much-
""Kings orders, one of the guards says, looking back at me with an amused sneer. You toyed with his heart, now he is making you a toy of the Court""
I had tears for what she had to go through.
I was starting to like the king in House of Kings, in this book I Hate Him. Sorry I know, but I do.
Raheem I hated him for a little bit in this book, just a little bit.
Ian omg I Love Him Always.
For the Conrath house members, I'm so proud of them, love them.
Rath I'm upset with him in a way, I know I shouldn't but I am.
The outcome of the Trial I knew it would happen, I just new. So happy for Alivia, but sad for her too. Love how she goes to her roots so she can move past what she went through, and Love who went with her too. The end of this BOOK had me at WTC. Omg why did it end like that.

7567,"This little router is perfect for travel so you can convert a wired internet connection to a wireless connection in your hotel.  This way you can are not anchored to a cable and you can use tablets, smart phones, etc. in addition to your laptop.

Pros:
Access Point - This is the default mode and worked perfectly in all my tests.  This mode is this unit's main asset and makes it so you can use tablets and smart phones on Wi-Fi.  In addition, you could use this mode at home for guests so you don't have to give out your main password/etc.  Almost a brainless setup in AP mode.  I could get this to operate quickly when using it out of the box in the default Access Point (AP) mode.

Cons:
Repeater Mode - Repeater mode didn't seem to work for me.  After setting it up, it looked successful on the router's web menu page.  However, I used a Wi-Fi channel scanner on both my Android phone and laptop and there was no noticeable difference in the signal I was trying to boost.  Disappointing as this was the mode I was most hoping to use this router for.
Minor Cons:
Bridge Mode - Seems to let you use ONLY the same channel as the parent router.  This is sort of logical since the internal WR700N radio can only use one channel at a time.  If it had 2 radios, it could obviously upload on one and download on the other.  While this mode is still useful, it is not as useful as if it could use a different channel than the bridged signal.

Accessing the administration menu is not ""normal"" as you have to use this IP Address: 192.168.0.10 with Subnet Mask 255.255.0.0.  The instructions are given in the manual how to do this.

9859,"Many years ago I had need for a mitre box and I purchased a cheap plastic model turned out by Stanley. It wasn't very good, but I was just an occasional user, not a woodworker, and the crude device sufficed in a crude way. Lately, I had need to cut some trimming for our front door and I decided to get a newer, better model.

A search at my local hardware store found this Stanley Clamping Mitre Box. It was plastic, just like my old one, and it was cheap. I suppose most craftsmen would consider it a piece of junk not worthy of being in a tool collection. However, I'm not a craftsman and don't have a refined tool collection: I just needed a way of cutting a few 45 degree corners on rare occasion. The Stanley Clamping Mitre Box works fine, much better than the old model. I like the clamps as they aid in making a much more precise cut. I also like the little edge on the one bottom side as it makes the device much easier to use on a table surface. Also, it's easy to fasten it to the table, if you like. This model is a tremendous improvement over the old one. It's not a refined precision tool, but it works very well for my limited needs. It's well worth the cost.

7510,"There is a tendency, especially among those who have started recently with SLRs, to rely heavily on zoom lenses. However, even the best zoom lenses are slower and less sharp than a good prime lens like this one. More importantly, prime lenses encourage good composition and many people who use them end up taking better pictures as a result.

Don't make the mistake of thinking a lens like this, for being fixed, is inflexible. Quite to the contrary, with its stunningly fast focus and its ability to work in low light conditions, this lens will produce worthwhile pictures in conditions where an f. 3.5 or f4 zoom would be a clunky alternative.

Some of the other reviews here emphasize the usefulness of the 1.4 aperture in taking indoor sports photos, or other specialized applications. This may be true, though it seems to me that a lens like this should not be thought of as a specialized tool, to be used only in especially low light conditions or where narrow depth of field is needed. It serves beautifully as a general purpose lens.

More often than not, Dream Theater sounds like they simply borrow bits from all the other prog rock bands out there, and try to mesh into their own style, but it doesn't work at all, at least not on this CD/album.  I recognise the influences here.  When I'm listening to the album, I can hear Metallica, Rush, ELP, Yes, Pink Floyd, and even Ravi Shankar/Indian influences.  But, unfortunately, the influences don't really mess.  They're all over the place without becoming cohesive, and the album doesn't work at all.  The musicianship is generally very good, but it feels cold and mechanical.  The lyrics are tremendously pedestrian and borderline stupid.  The lead vocalist is desperately trying to bring emotion to the awful lyrics, and he ends up making them worse.  There is one tremendous song that I have played over and over again, and that's Beyond this Life.  Even though the lyrics and singing aren't very good, the music on that one track is fantastic.

I love the touch controls, ability to change the speed and have a timer. The flow of air can be optimally directed by changing the vents. Airflow can be felt across an entire room; I suspect because the air comes out in a more laminar rather than turbulent fashion. And best of all it is silent.

The Vornado advertises itself as not needing oscillation because it moves so much air that it keeps the room's air circulating. I guess I understand this thinking, but I think that it needs oscillation. When the fan is pointed directly at me, even from a distance, I feel like I need a break from it at times. Similarly, when I have it directed away, I do feel the increased overall room air increased circulation, but still in warm Arizona feel like I need more direct, past-my-skin airflow. In essence, I want oscillation. I feel that the claim that the airflow pattern negates the necessity of oscillation is overstated.

This one complaint aside, the Vornado truly is an amazing piece of engineering. Most of the time the oscillating feature isn't really needed. The fan fits attractively and neatly even in tight spaces and improves air movement throughout the entire room. The controls are easy to use and very convenient. The price seems reasonable for the quality of fan and volume of near-silent airflow you get from this circulator fan.",3,"[-3.52761271315715, -3.5589991243718133, -2.3184833116142625, 1.1657475274768825, -3.0752949165500434]",1.1657475274768825

690,"There are so many books out there that promise to help you find your path in life, to help you achieve meaning, that it's tough to know which one to read -- and which one will be different than the others.

I've read scores of these types of books, and ""The Purpose Driven Life"" is different in several ways. First, it offers you a step-by-step plan for creating a sense of meaning in your life. Second, it's based in scripture. Third, it advocates making the church the center of your life.

These differences can also be the book's drawbacks. I always sensed that the author had a bit of an agenda -- being a pastor of a huge church, of course he believes in the importance and sanctity of organized religion. But what if you aren't a member of a church? What if your church is dysfunctional? What if you feel called to do things outside your church?

I for one believe that God has given us different talents and different strengths and different passions. SOME of us are called to serve in the church. And some of us are called elsewhere. Warren seems to ignore those of us who are pulled to serve others and use our talents outside of our church. After reading this book twice (once on my own and once through a small-group study through my church), I was still left with many, many questions -- and a deep-seated feeling that there was more to life than what Warren had presented.",3,"[-3.0561798237803126, -3.522841435663636, -1.792522486832618, 1.1650408132744958, -3.729138338137744]",1.1650408132744958

Both my husband and I enjoyed them very much and would make them again ( and buy them again)  We aren't big pancake eaters but the high protein content appealed to me to try them.  We are used to eating whey protein, either in smoothies or protein bars so I was curious to try it in a pancake.  There's a strong peanut smell upon opening the bag - so far, so good!  The mix blends readily with minimal stirring, no lumps.  Because it contains baking soda I let it sit for a moment while the pan heated up.  The pacakes cooked normally ( ie: open bubbles so you know when to flip them)  they taste great.  I will say that my first bite was a bit of a surprise, but only because it smells like a pancake, looks like a pancake ( IS a pancake haha) but it tastes a bit different, naturally, due to the high protein content.  We enjoyed these very much and moreso because I do feel they are healthier than white flour pancakes.  There is minimum sugar in a serving - only 7 grams.  Very tasty.

9671,"This came as a 'for review' item from G7. I've tried out and reviewed several G7 bulbs over the last year but G7 never-ever asked or even implied that a 'good' review was expected in exchange.

It is meant to fit into a recessed 6"" light socket and, while large, the flattened top design helps it fit in well. The output light is a steady and pleasant 3000K 'soft white', not unlike what comes out of a 'soft white' incandescent bulb. Besides the obvious power savings that come with LEDs that could actually save money eventually, I can think of a few more good reasons to 'go LED' at this time:

- It's dimmable and, while not cheap, I believe that most dimmable fluorescents of this output are as expensive if not more. G7 recommends that you do not mix brands of dimmable LEDs on the same switch.
- LEDs have no mercury so it's one less thing to worry about if this ever fails.
- The 10 year replacement warranty appears to be quite reasonable.
- It appears to be a good quality, well engineered product.
- Turns on/off instantly, unlike CFLs.
- Causes no harmful radio interference and it's operation is not affected by outside interference.

Of course, there are tradeoffs and they are: size, weight and price. While it does fit into a recessed lighting socket, this item is significantly larger and heavier than either an incandescent or a CFL. As for the price, it speaks for itself. LED prices do seem to be on a downward trend.

I happen to believe that the LEDs are the future of illumination and G7's products are all well engineered, nicely packaged, quality products. Getting this G7 product is probably as good as you can get for your money today if you factor in 'quality' and 'design'.",3,"[-2.125939655808348, -3.227419810953964, -1.9715827039992473, 1.1649508556894739, -3.7897869048749575]",1.1649508556894739

9781,"The Happy Pappy was pleased as punch to test out the Honest Kitchen Beef Bone Broth.  The broth is very similar to a ""human food"" broth without all the salt.  The ingredients include dehydrated beef broth, dehydrated beef, dehydrated pumpkin, dehydrated parsley, and turmeric extract.  The granules come in a tin about the size of a Republic of Tea Canister, and is filled a little over 3/4 full when settled.  Like most broths, you can adjust the amount of broth granules to water to make it more of less flavorful.  I use this broth to make my dog's dry kibble seem more exciting, so I use only a little bit of granules (1/2 teaspoon) to a bit of water and kibble.

The broth went over well for my dog - he was more receptive to his meal, and ate it with no complaint.  I offered the broth to him in the afternoon by itself, and he happily guzzled it down.  It was nice to find a quick substitute for the broths I normally make.  I usually boil broth and soup for the family and my dog gets a small helping when I make it.  Because it's been warm, I haven't been making soup as of late, so my dog has been eating a lot of very plain kibble (something he doesn't mind, but would probably enjoy more with some more flavoring).  With this little can, I can make a small serving of broth for my dog, but without all the salt and MSG that most ""human food"" has.

Overall, this is a nice treat to offer to your dog or cat either by itself or to make their kibble extra tasty.  Like all food products, taste is highly subjective, so if you can get a sample of it for your pets first, you can see if your pet will respond well to it.

These units will go off much faster than the ionization type and can give you those valuable minutes to get out of a house before it fills with toxic smoke. Should you get rid of the ionization ones? No, but do consider adding these to your current system so that you have both flash and smoldering fires covered.

The First Alert Micro Photoelectric Smoke alarm is a great choice. It is small and not very noticeable. In size, it's not much bigger than a sprinkler head that you might see in a hotel or dorm room.

Electricity is everywhere,  but most of the time it is properly insulated to protect those around it.  However, like me (at my advanced age), you may have been shocked on occasion by a faulty wire or outlet.  Stepping on an abraided washing machine cable can ruin your day.  As can working barefoot on concrete with a faulty drill.  That was the first time that I found out that I could fly.

So understanding whether an outlet is safe to work on is pretty important.  Some guys will laugh off a quick jolt but I have always been concerned with how strong that jolt could be.  You wouldn't think that dropping a table radio into the bathtub would be any big deal, but it can (and has been) fatal in a number of cases.

Because of my basic knowledge of electricity I have avoided doing any electrical projects around the house.  Now however I am ready to move into that area, having already replaced a 4 gang switch and installing a new garbage disposal.  Might not sound like a big deal to most of you but it is for me.

This Amprobe Voltage Tester helps give me the confidence to know that I'm not going to do another personal fly-over in our garage.  Nor is it likely that I will set my hair on fire.  Well-made, easy to use, and fortunately very accurate.  Having even a little confidence can go a long way toward successfully completing a new job.",3,"[-2.8217138356243288, -3.9196613244136254, -2.15829311030068, 1.1602292050981116, -2.886141862364157]",1.1602292050981116

The manual says that the batteries for the red flashing LED typically last up to 3 months.  Some of my real security cameras have LED indicators that can be configured in the software to turn on during access/viewing, turn on continuously, or turn off.  None of them flash in a regular pattern so using the flashing LED feature might give it away (would have been better if the red LED could be turned on continuously).

Overall, these artistic details are very minor and this is a useful deterrent for those places where it is impossible to run wires, but you want thieves to wet their pants when they look up and see what might be watching them.",3,"[-3.7742144883261384, -3.9304967137565585, -1.9862598596784513, 1.159867324543428, -3.6703268884069487]",1.159867324543428

7736,"Normally, I am not a huge fan of snacks in pouches -- I'd rather just eat a piece of fruit. However, this is one of the better pouches I've had. I think the first reason for this is simply because it's not 90% applesauce like a lot of other pouches (this doesn't contain apples at all, as a matter of fact). This achieves its texture through the use of chia seeds, which tend to take on liquids and become a bit gelatinous. You can definitely feel the chia seeds as you eat this, but I still found the texture to be fairly pleasant.

I felt like I had a little easier time of completely emptying the pouch on this one than I have with some other snacks in pouches lately. Not sure why, as the pouch looks similar to others I've tried. (Maybe it's the texture of the food inside?) At any rate, I was pleased with that aspect of things.

My favorite thing about this, though, was probably the taste. The berry taste was really strong (and really good), and wasn't artificially sweetened. While there were some sugars, they were natural fruit sugars, and there's also some fiber and protein in these. (Please note that the omega-3 fatty acids in chia seeds are mostly in the form of ALA, which is inefficiently converted in the body to the active forms of DHA and EPA. If you want the full benefit of vegan/vegetarian omega-3s, you'll need to find a supplement for that. There are quite a few available on Amazon, though.)

7960,"I use lots and lots of tablecloths in my business. My current rotation is almost all linen or cotton tablecloths, which are durable and drape really well, but are prone to staining and do wrinkle a lot (usually I just live with the wrinkles; but for some occasions, I'm forced to iron, a drag and a time suck). I do my best to live with both by making use of table runners or decorative napkins/tea towels, and by removing them from the dryer before they're bone dry, so they can be smoothed somewhat without ironing.

However, I natural fibers are high maintenance and synthetics are improving, so I thought I'd try out a wrinkle-free, stainproof synthetic alternative. The informal gingham seemed like a good choice, since a picnic table has a more casual vibe going in. I have had a pretty good experience with another brand of synthetic tablecloth with a slubbed linen-like appearance, which holds up much better in the stain-prone area of our coffee service table. And I do have several DII gingham cotton tablecloths that we use for picnics and outdoor events.

Unfortunately, this just looks dramatically cheaper than the DII cotton equivalents. The fabric is lightweight and fluttery, it has a shiny, plasticky look, and ugly 1/3"" turned hems that overlap in the corners instead of the attractive 1"" mitered hems of the DII cotton tablecloths. It is easy-care, and washes well and dries almost instantly, so it deserves more than one star for that.

Because it's shiny and plasticky, it's actually a good choice for a table covering in my booth when I do craft fairs, as the wool fibers I sell quickly stick all over a natural fiber tablecloth and make an ugly mess.

One of my favorite sections was ""Thinking with Both Hands.""  Americans can be really blindsided by their own world views and uncomfortable with irreconciliable tensions in scripture.  She does a fantastic job explaining the worldview from which the Biblical authors wrote, and why they were okay with describing God as both completely sovereign while still emphasizing that our human choices are meaningful.  She uses several other examples as well, and I thought it was beautifully explained and worded.

I also absolutely loved the chapter ""Our Longing Father"" where she talks about how indifference to evil is its own form of evil, and discusses God's judgment in light of that.  I had never thought of the absence of judgment over evil being wrong, and she gave me new insight into the nature of God.

There were numerous things like these two examples where she explained scripture in the context of a worldview I'm not familiar with, which added quite a bit of depth and gave me a lot to think about.  Her theology is also absolutely in line with mainstream evangelical theology.

The only minor cricitisms I had were that I thought she overglamorized Jewish thought (e.g. not really touching on Jesus' concerns about where Jewish scholarship had led the Jewish people) and I'm assuming she doesn't have children because some of her personal examples were not particularly deep.

9753,"Frankly, in the past I have not been all that impressed with Science Diet/Hill's brand pet foods.  I am VERY impressed with their marketing, but when it comes down to ingredients and value, not so much.  Hill's has historically been the prescription-food side of Science Diet, for cats with special dietary needs, but the cats I've fed it to would rather die than eat it.

The Hill's Ideal Balance is changing my mind about all that.  The ingredients are good, whole foods such as chicken (that's right, chicken, not chicken by-products or chicken flavor, and it's right up front as the first ingredient), egg, peas, apples, and rice, and the cats eat it eagerly.  I'd probably dispute the need for cats to eat things like apples and rice, but Hill's goal was to create a food that offers 100% balanced nutrition, so these may have played a part in that (it's also full of supplements to achieve that balance, so I suspect not).

The price of this food is not as high as it first appears.  The nutrition is excellent and, again, is achieved with quality ingredients.  Moreover, the suggested feeding amounts are less than foods containing cheap, non-nutritious fillers.

One of the things I always have liked about the Hill's prescription diets is their money-back guarantee.  I was happy to see that this over-the-counter food continues that policy, so it's pretty risk-free for your cat to try this.  If you like the convenience of dry cat food, Hill's Ideal Balance is well worth taking a look at.",3,"[-4.748758135902921, -3.351520581446509, -1.8307930831773032, 1.1572461312839255, -3.6890774010697958]",1.1572461312839255

9983,"This HOT WHEELS TRACK BUILDER SPIRAL STACK-UP set is a terrific choice for expanding an existing Hot Wheels track layout, as long as you have a fair amount of floor or table space.  It's a really large stunt that's about five feet long when it's assembled according to the boxed instructions (though the launcher ramps can be rearranged, using two towers instead of one, to use less space).

The way this set works, is that the first car launched from the top of the tower launches two more cars (not included with the set) as it speeds down the ramp, then triggers a release that dumps a car off the second level of the ""box"" located at the end of the double ramp, until it finally exits the stunt through the lower level of the ""box"".  The second car that is launched (by the first car) speeds down a long ramp that is connected near the top of the tower, and exits the stunt.  The third car that is launched travels down a short ramp and stops on the second level of the exit ""box"", waiting to for the first car to dump it.

There's a lot of action that makes me smile in this track builder set.  Also, the two cars that actually exit the setup have a lot of momentum left that will carry them elsewhere in a well-designed layout.  One of the best things about this setup is that all three cars usually complete the entire run flawlessly, without jumping the track or losing momentum or stopping too soon.  The ""Nitrium"" car that comes with the set is a fairly heavy one, because the set works best with a weighty car starting in the top position.

For me, this Hot Wheels playset was a little more challenging to assemble than others that I've set up.  As always, the key thing is to identify your parts correctly, and to keep looking until you find the right place to make a connection if you don't understand the instructions right away.  The color-coding of the plastic parts helped me with one confusing part--the set has two red launcher arms that attach to a yellow base, and one gray launcher lever that attaches to a gray base.  In my customer photos, there are three cars loaded into the set--the orange/white car at the very top is the included Nitrium car.",3,"[-5.982756260567717, -4.409577827320957, -2.5862363398468604, 1.1570685840528299, -2.6782663826046607]",1.1570685840528299

In a nutshell Electric Warrior is one of the greatest and most important records in rock n' roll history. Countless bands form or changed their approach because of this album alone. 1 part glam, 1 part folk, and three parts excess and you have T.Rex's masterpiece, Electric Warrior.

In terms of glam, Marc Bolan's 1971 opus is on par with Bowie's Ziggy Stardust, who could have even learned a few things from this.

From the first high-healed stomp of 'Mambo Sun' through the beautiful pop balladry of 'Cosmic Dancer' on through the rollicking 'Jeepster' and 'Planet Queen' and the  indulgent 'Life's A Gas' and the closing of the bitter sweet 'Rip Off' This is one of those albums that you can't even comprehend making or dream of making because it is not plausible, it simply just happens out of nowhere.

To say that 'Bang A Gong (Get It On)' is the focal point of the album would be more than cliche, but at the same time I dare anyone to find it's contemporary, because even on a flawless album such as this it still reigns supreme and triumphs over all. It's half-pick guitar riff, and evocative imagery make it one of rocks most celebrated and covered tunes.

Electric Warrior is simply put...that good, and this reissue is THE definitive version. With extensive liner notes, lyrics, a poster. Great sound, and plenty of bonus material.

9772,"I think KONG rubber toys are super durable but I have had mixed success with KONG plush toys.  You just can't expect a plush toy to hold up as well -- too many weak points.  Unfortunately, that was the case here.

Anyway, this octopus came in a dog subscription box (forget which one, as I subscribe to quite a few of them).  It is a good size for my dog (she is an 87 pound Rottweiler).  It is super cute and it has a squeaker in addition to crinkly stuff in all the legs, so it makes a variety of interesting sounds.  My dog was definitely interested in it, too.  And it was fun to watch her playing with it, with all the legs going in different directions as she put this in her mouth.

After a little while (maybe 10-15 minutes?), she did put a hole in one of the legs.  It was at this point that I took it away from her.  (My dog has a tendency to eat stuffing...)  So the legs didn't come off, but just be aware there are other weak areas.  For my dog, 10-15 minutes is about average for a toy destruction time.  She has killed some other plush toys in as little as one minute.

At any rate, it is best to supervise your dog with any new toy until you see how it will hold up.  This may be just fine with some dogs; my last Rottie would've kept this for years without damaging it.  But this is not a very good choice for super destructive dogs or for dogs that like to pull stuffing out of plush toys.",3,"[-2.3381692629978836, -3.131092694529049, -2.1143835593361167, 1.1559174042093214, -3.237412157207433]",1.1559174042093214

9208,"Just like the Blade Runner team did with its Final Cut, the Star Wars team needs to get some money together and just offer the originals as they were, and then redo anything and everything to perfection for a Final Cut that is up to modern standards. Right now Lucas has left this trilogy is such a haphazard state you really have to wonder if the guy has any clue about quality control. It is appalling at times. Some things are redone in the original trilogy, and other things are simply out of place much or not up to the standard we have set today. Blade Runner had a lot of issues of the technical nature.... Star Wars is the same. It's obvious he wants to correct things, but then why go about it in such a cheap and unfaithful way?

You see Lucas has a problem imo. The new trilogy has a LOT of heavily dated CGI, and if he honestly ever thinks that muck of a thing is going to be decent it needs an entire makeover. Good luck with that. With these original films we have exhaustive fan lists detailing pretty much every mistake from every frame. All he really needs to do is consult these guides or make his own... and then go to work correcting these things to some high degree of quality. Just issue a final cut and invest a 100 million or 2 George! Restore this set as an original set and as a new maximized final cut! So many little mistakes and retouches could be given that extra level of polish. Many fans would not be so adamantly horrified at the treatment of the films if they were finally just given a decent once over.

I guess the mistakes they corrected for the bluray release do qualify as something, but they clearly didn't spend the money to actually make this a timeless piece in any regard. It just looks like the surgeon up and left in too many spots.

Let's be real here. George Lucas is so far not really a man of quality. He doesn't have it in him if you ask me to bring quality to this series and release the originals and the final cuts with extensive restoration. It's such a huge community but Lucas chooses not to use nor please any of it. It really is a travesty on many levels.

Its divided into five topics per letter, making it easily accessible no matter how you choose to incorporate it into your life. Petition (asking) topics range from adoption to grieving to infertility to ugly thoughts and even to trafficking and homelessness and incarceration. Each letter also includes praise topics which focus mostly on names of God, such as Burden-Bearer, Keeper of my Soul, and Prince of Peace. These all  petitions and praises  start with a related Bible verse then move to some guided prayer prompts and end with an example prayer. My only real complaint is that the praise topics don't come first in each letters section, but that is minor in the overall scheme of things.

Bottom Line: Pray A to Z makes a nice addition to anyones spiritual arsenal and, considering the time of year were in, would be a great gift for new believers and prayer warriors alike. Use it in your personal prayer time or as a family or small group  or all of the above! The aesthetics of the book are so well done, too. Worthy Inspired Publishers do such a fantastic job with cover design and little touches inside and out that make their books special to own.  Pray A to Z isn't meant to be a book of prayers that you recite mindlessly, but as a stepping stone to deepen your prayer life and cover your community in grace. The possibilities are endless!

9874,"Here's a nifty little inexpensive item that I will very seldom use. Everyone has need of screwdrivers from time to time and almost everyone has a small collection of screwdrivers that work, more or less, some of the time. A major problem of mine has been with really small screws on appliances, electronic items and things of that sort. Conventional screwdrivers are generally useless. Then there are those strange specialized screws that are neither slot head nor phillips head. Boy, can they be a headache. When the problem becomes great enough, then a lot of time is spent (wasted) in Home Depot and other such stores seeking out possible solutions. Ten or twenty dollars can go by real easily, not to mention the time and gas money, just for the removal of one or two fastening devices..

This nifty little screwdriver set has 32 bits, some of which I didn't even know existed and will probably never use in my lifetime. Oh well, if the problem ever comes up I've possibly got the solution. I've used the set on a few items so far and it works real well. Keep in mind that I'm not a professional ""fixer."" I'm just a homeowner who has occasional use for such a set. When I need it, it's invaluable. I'm very pleased to store it away in my garage tool area. I anticipate it will save a lot of time and effort and trips to Home Depot.

9445,"As adults, we loath kids movies. Sure, some people get into the Disney stuff, but for the most part, adults despise films that are made for kids and I am no exception. It takes a really good story and some clever writing for a PG film to appeal to adults as much as it does to kids, and it's virtually impossible to do this while still keeping the PG rating intact, but somehow the writers of Hoodwinked have accomplished this twice! The story really isn't important, it's geared toward kids and is very simple and predictable. What's not easy is keeping the adults awake, while the kids have the time of their lives. The writers accomplished this by throwing in parodies of classic adult films. Hoodwinked Too! has references to Goodfella, Die Hard, Silence of The Lambs, and a half a dozen other classic films, and it was those scenes that were the most fun. Also interesting to note, the voice of the wolf was done by Patrick Warburton, who does the voice of Joe Swanson on Family Guy, and it was really difficult for me to see the wolf as a totally different character. Hoodwinked and now it's sequel are nothing like Toy Story and aren't going to blow anyone away, but they are pretty good and while the kids are watching it, you'll find yourself getting in a few laughs as well.

7881,"In general, filtered water bottles are a flawed product. I have yet to find one that performs at a high level. When investigating many types, the one I would have maybe recommended changed the design and now the filter is prone to fall off.

I would recommend filtered water bottles for frequent travelers, or those away from home who are looking for quality water. If you want to have filtered water at home, go with a filtered pitcher or with an under sink water filter (the 3M Filtrete filters are great). Use this filtered water to fill a water bottle for your around town wanderings.

The ZeroWater Travel Bottle filter does have value though. There are some good reasons to consider this product as a traveler. The filter is excellent. The five stage ion exchange filter removes solids like fertilizers and has an indicator that lets you know when you should change your filter. Plain charcoal just removes the chlorine and ups the taste. If you care about water quality a high performing filter like what the ZeroWater has is important. Replacement filter cost is reasonable for the quality that it is.

Now the annoying stuff. The water bottle is tall. Too tall to fit under a standard bathroom sink. If you are on the road, you would have to use a cup or the tub faucet to fill the bottle. The design of the lid allows water to get trapped underneath it. For this reason, I would recommend using only potable water. Using this camping with untreated water could lead to problems. Sometimes when I am filling it, air gets trapped in there and limits the amount of water it holds. It helps to leave the straw up, but that doesn't always do it. It also takes about 2.5 to 3 fills to fill up the bottle.

If you travel a ton, ZeroWaters travel bottle filter is worth considering. Otherwise there are better products out there to filter water.",3,"[-3.371529317221331, -2.4629598658001446, -1.6965636330251255, 1.1519509004052777, -3.727596163280322]",1.1519509004052777

Fans were camping out at movie theatres in anticipation of tickets going on sale. ""Fanboys"" is the story of four friends who realize that one of them will not be there for the opening.  Linus (Chris Marquette) has cancer and they really want him to see ""The Phantom Menace."" Their idea:  break into Skywalker Ranch and see the first cuts.

Eric (Sam Huntington) isn't quite on the page yet.  He's abandoned the dream of creating a comic book and  literally sold out, selling cars at his Dad's dealership.  He hasn't seen Linus in years and doesn't even realize his best friend has cancer.

Hutch (Dan Fogler) despite still living in his Mom's 'carriage house' is a pretty good persuader. And Windows (Jay Baruchel) has found an online girlfriend ""Rogue Leader"" who will help them with plans, etc. for Skywalker Ranch.

Still, they manage to get on the road and what a long strange trip it is from Ohio to California.  We've got cameo appearances by William Shatner, Billy D. Williams, and Carrie Fisher.

We do have these at the office and the coffee there is disgusting as 'free' office coffee is supposed to be, to the point that if I ever 'have to' drink it, I always pick 'decaf' because I wouldn't waste any of my caffeine daily quote on... that. With that background, I've heard so many good things about the Keurig process, I couldn't resist ordering this one as a Black Friday special.

So far, I am not disappointed, or not yet. The machine was pretty easy to set up and it makes coffee quickly. As for the quality... I'm used to grind and brew my own so... no, it's not 'just as good', not even close but this should largely depend of the specific Keurig flavor used and I've only tried a couple so far. Definitely better than the horrors that our office machine brews though.

The specific pod coffee flavor aside, brewing a cup, once the machine is plugged in and the water reservoir is full is as easy opening up the top intake, dropping in a fresh pod, closing it up, selecting the 'size' and pushing the 'on' button. Coffee is ready in less than a minute. By the way, they have 5 sample pods in the box but those I've tried didn't impress me. Like I said, you can pick your favorite size (S, M, L) but there is not 'strength' selector.

7758,"I'm in love with this stuff for making bulletproof coffee. Ghee is just the fat/oil from butter so even people with lactose intolerance can have it. The other benefit is that it doesn't require refrigeration and tastes incredible.

So while it is very good to cook with, especially for sauteeing foods (incredible butter mushrooms!), my favorite use is to keep a jar with me and drop a teaspoon of the stuff in every cup of coffee I have at work. Not only does it make my coffee taste better, but it is also filling usually tiding me over without breakfast until lunch.

I've been on a ketogenic diet (high fat, very low carb) for over 3 years. My health has improved dramatically and I've lost almost 70 pounds and don't struggle at all to keep it off. The difficulty, however, is to eat enough fat throughout the day relative to other macronutrients (carbs & protein). Adding healthy fat to coffee and other meals is a great way to make them more satiating and increase relative fat intake.

This ghee tastes incredible and is perfect for me to keep in my workbag to add butter to almost anything as it doesn't require refrigeration and spreads at room temperature.

9287,"I was in graduate school at the University of Washington in Seattle in the 1960s. Seattle had four art theaters at the time and all showed foreign films, a rarity at that time. I became an English comedy aficionado. Some of the films were just hilarious and so much different than American comedies. I can't remember the movies themselves, but some of the leading actors were Alec Guiness, Peter Sellers and Terry Thomas, plus I'm probably shorting a few others. In any case, I loved their comedies. The could be very visual and slapstick or subtle and droll, or a mixture. One thing was certain. They were very funny.

I totally lost track of British comedies over the past few decades, then all of a sudden I became aware of Mr. Bean as played by Rowan Atkinson. It's the old British comedy through and through. Trust me. I've watched the Mr Bean Series and then Bean, The Movie. Very funny. Try them, you might like them, but it takes a certain twisted mind.

In any case, Rowan Atkinson is also responsible for ""Johnny English,"" a DVD movie I watched last night. I found it on the five dollar rack at Wal-Mart. English, played by Atkinson, was a bumbling government secret agent. It seems the queens jewels were stolen and English was the only available secret agent who might solve the crime. Pity the British people. Johnny English is a bumbler of the first order. His foot is firmly in his mouth, right up to the knee. Almost nothing goes right as he bumbles his way through the mystery. And it's funny. Lot's of laughs roll out, some of them side splitters. It's an old-time British comedy, all over again. The acting was.... Well, you wouldn't expect great acting on this kind of farce, would you? Expect a lot of distorted facial expressions and things of that sort. It fits. The filming is quite good and some of the stunts rival those of the Keystone Kops. It's all a good time. I finished the DVD with a smile on my face.

The 32 ounce is small especially when you insert the plunger & the top lid; they take up a lot of room in the canister. You are really are not getting 32 ounces of storage so keep that in mind when you are choosing a size. I like the 96 ounce because I frequently buy the big bags of whole coffee beans at Costco, dump most of it in this canister for longer term storage & fill the 32 ounce canister for everyday use. We go through a lot of coffee so it's nice not having to fumble with that big canister first thing in the morning & it helps keep beans fresher longer. Before I had this big canister, I could taste the degradation of my beans after a few days of opening the package when they were just stored in the bag they come in. I do think this canister is good at prolonging the bean flavor for at least a week to 10 days.

The thing to know about these chips is that instead of salt, you get lime.  As in a lime ""dust"" on the chip.

7933,"Good things:

The big handles make it easier to hold and push down to cut through fruits and vegetables. I've had a cheaper apple corer-slicer that was really hard to push though the apple because the handles weren't big enough to really get a grip on it.

The interchangeable blades give you two options without having to buy two separate cutters.

It works...mostly.

Bad things:

The blades are slightly recessed in the ring, which means that it doesn't cut cleanly all the way down to the cutting board. With the apple corer/slicer, it's not a huge deal because you can just pull the cutter  up off the apple and pull the slices apart. But, with the vegetable blade, the potato slices remain stuck in the blade. The easiest and safest way to deal with this that I could figure out was to take my measuring cup and push the bottom of the potato up into the blade so the blade cut all the way through. I still had to pull the slices out the top, but it was more manageable that way. Still kind of a pain, though.

These blades are sharp. Really sharp. You cannot handle this gadget casually. You have to be careful and on your guard every time you handle it. My Mom cut herself twice in the space of two days - once washing it and once putting it in the cupboard. The second time was a pretty significant cut. There has to be a way to design something like this to reduce the likelihood of cutting yourself.

Other comments:

Perhaps I'm just not sufficiently coordinated, but I had to cut the end off the potato to get a flat end to make it stand up so I could slice it without tipping (possibly my fear of getting my fingers too close to the blades was affecting my slicing technique).

In case I haven't yet made this point clear, the blades on this cutter are really sharp and very easy to cut yourself on. Honestly, I was ready to throw it in the trash after the second time my Mom cut herself. I'm storing it in a plastic container so no one reaches in the cupboard and accidentally touches the blades.",3,"[-2.287817463622829, -3.1131117588366832, -1.9366505853778808, 1.1478247475921917, -3.2662132045722294]",1.1478247475921917

I opened that box, and inside saw an Amazon basics box 13.5"" x 10.5"" x 1.5"".  Inside of that box (feeling like nested Russian dolls at this point) was... VIOLA!  this 11.6 inch case.  I'm sure this case had a very comfy ride inside the plastic wrap, inside the box, inside the Q3 monster box.

Now, at first when you touch this case from the outside you think.  ooooo, mega protection.  But open the zipper and find that there is a cushy white bubble/air something inside giving it the cush.  Ok.  So, take that out, and you have a nice neoprene sleeve.

Putting this on a 11.6"" Thinkpad x140e, it did not quite, really fit.  The first zipper was a little hard to get around the top corner, and coming across the laptop into the home stretch, I really had to pinch the fabric together to get it zipped shut.  I'm sure it will be fine as it will stretch out over time.  But Amazon should make this just a couple mm longer in each direction to ensure that beefer notebooks like the thinkpad (a little thicker than most) will fit comfortably.

I also wish Amazon would go to a percentage rating system like most things are on the Internet rather than trying to shoehorn your perceptions into 5 start.  Amazon products are not movies, there is much more nuance in products.

After the incredible In a Silent Way from a year earlier, Davis continues his experimentation with avant-garde and fusion, but this time with a bolder and darker sound that really contrasts his work from In a Silent Way. Perhaps the most noteworthy aspect of this recording is its spontaneity; basically, the band more or less picked up their respective instruments and started playing. It's this unusual approach which makes Bitches Brew stand out. While listening, one can quickly conclude that the band was doing a long and spontaneous jam session, as some sounds don't mesh 100%. Still, this recording maintains a certain charm and appeal, despite its rawness. I'm not a jazz expert (especially with knowledge of song structures), but can safely say that Bitches Brew is loose, and purely meant to be transitional and trailblazing. Miles' trumpet is exceptionally loud on this one, and can really dominate at times.

9914,"This is a great idea if you wish a light in a location but don't want to fuss with wires and conduit. We had such a need to I accepted a unit in for evaluation when offered.

The device is conceptually simple. A solar panel charges a lithium battery (supplied and installed) which in turn, powers an LED array at night when a sensor detects sufficient darkness. The manufacturer implies that the battery is good for a year and a half before losing its stonk and needing replacement.

Externally, the unit is all plastic which is good for corrosion but I'm unsure how strong it'd be to side stresses when pressing the also plastic stake into the ground. I did drive it into hard dirt using a good deal of my 200 lbs weight but I also was very careful to press directly down and put no side loads on the stake or upper unit. I'd feel better if the stake were metal but then there may be the whole corrosion issue to deal with. I suppose the plastic is a reasonable compromise and of course, allows for less cost to make and less cost to buy as well.

I have it where it gets maybe 4 hours of light filtered through tree branches and then another two hours of direct sunlight or not an ideal place for a solar device.

It's easier for them to digest, and it has a higher water content -- important because many cats are reluctant to drink enough water.  I've been trying all kinds of different brands and flavors of wet cat food in order to tempt my two holdouts.

The most recent flavor I offered was Fancy Feast Classic Chicken Feast.  As with the other ""classic"" Fancy Feast varieties, this food has more of a uniform texture (can't see individual pieces of meat).  It's a pretty soft texture and would be good for cats with dental problems.

I offered this flavor two days in a row.  The cat in question ate it both days, though he was a little slower with this food than with some of the ones that have little chunks or pieces of meat.  Other cats lined up to lick his bowl afterwards.  (I like to offer flavors two days in a row to make sure it wasn't a fluke if a cat ate it the first time.)

Ingredients-wise, I'm pleased that this doesn't include any grain or soy.  There is guar gum (a thickener, which comes from a particular type of bean).  While most cats with inflammatory bowel disease should not eat chicken or fish (this does contain a small amount of fish, and also ""meat by-products,"" which could be anything), IF you have a cat with IBD that is reluctant to eat and you're worried about your cat's weight, this might be an option in an emergency.  At least it doesn't have wheat, gluten, or corn!  It's hard to find cat foods that are missing all of those, so this definitely gets points there.

Not sure.

I've owned several silk and satin pillowcases over the years but my dream has always been to have a set of silk sheets. As a college student that's not quite realistic for me (yet) so I decided to go on the hunt for a decent set of satin ones.

Now don't get me wrong, I adore silk, but satin is appealing in its own ways. It ages better (even when you religiously hand wash your silk) has more slip (less damage over night to your hair and less wrinkles on our face for us stomach and side sleepers) and the way it feels grows on you once you stop comparing it to silk. I wouldn't say silk feels better than high quality satin per se, because its just a different feel altogether.

But these sheets....boy. I had realistic expectations, but the quality isn't even worth $25 - and this is coming from someone who has no issue paying double that for one pillow case. I can confidently say these cost no more than $9 to manufacturer in china. They are plastic, sure they're shiny....but this is the worst satin I have ever felt.

This cd far surpasses the first, which I loved, in song selection, vocal performance and interpretation and Carrie proves herself a true unique talent with her own special gifts.

I can put this cd in my player and let it run over and over for there is no filler here for me.  But there are certainly some highlights.  ALL AMERICAN GIRL allows Carrie to hit some notes never heard before.  Her interpretation of I TOLD YOU SO is heartfelt and very much her own.  But it is the standout I KNOW YOU WON'T a weepy ballad that Carrie turns into raw emotion that will stun you.  She holds notes forever and puts all her range and capabilities into it.  I find this song as much a classic as Linda Ronstadt doing DESPERADO.  Of course the uptempo FLAT ON THE FLOOR and LAST NAME are awesome.

I am thrilled with how openly Carrie Underwood has been accapted into the country music community for she is what the genre stands for.

7571,"The S73 does what it promises - speedy read/writes with a couple of useful enhancements to make it qualify as a good pick. And, for this 32GB model, a lot of storage, enough to hold (uncompressed) data from 6 DVDs. Given that it's fully compatible with USB 2.0, it's wise to go with a USB 3.0 drive like this one  even if your computer does not have a USB 2.0 port. You will be able to take advantage of increased performance when you upgrade to a machine that comes with USB 3.0.

My unscientific benchmark shows the following, when passing data through a USB 2.0 interface on my not-so-speedy T400 laptop: 3489 files, 5.96 GB.

- Copy from S73 to HDD, 6'51"" at speeds from 20.1 MB/s to 14.9 MB/s
- Copy from HDD to S73, 17'18"" at speeds from .95 MB/s to 5.92 MB/s

Which is quite decent, given that this is through a USB 2.0 port. Performance should be much higher if a USB 3.0 port was available.

9988,"This RAVENSBURGER STATUE OF LIBERTY 3D PUZZLE (108-Piece) makes a nice souvenir of a visit to Liberty Island, but it's not a great 3D puzzle.  All of the flat plastic jigsaw puzzle pieces are used to construct the truncated-pyramid platform (a brown, brick-and-stone building in real life) that forms the base of the Statue of Liberty.  There are only two ""puzzle pieces"" for Lady Liberty--a molded green plastic statue with a golden torch, and a molded green crown that snaps onto the head of the statue.

The plastic jigsaw pieces are nicely printed to look like the statue's base, but the brown tones and pictures of bricks are boring to assemble. The jigsaw pieces are numbered on the backs to give the correct order of construction.  You can assemble them by the numbers if you want a fairly easy puzzle (or if you're new to building 3D puzzles), or you can assemble them the traditional way by matching up the pictures on the fronts of the pieces.

Some of the jigsaw pieces are hinged, to make the corners of the 4-sided base.  You just bend the pieces gently in the middle before using them to connect other pieces.  The statue snaps onto the platform, and the platform snaps (with little clips) onto a laminated cardboard piece that is printed to look like the plaza that surrounds the real statue.

I'm a big, big fan of Ravensburger jigsaws, and I love the Ravensburger 3D-puzzle globes. But I was very disappointed with this puzzle, because the Statue of Liberty itself is ""pre-assembled"" (except for the crown).

This is not a 5 star wallet if all factors are considered. I 've had expensive wallets from Italy and this is not in the same class. My review is taking into consideration the price, workmanship and what it is supposed to accomplish with RFID blocking.

New Balance has matching training gear but if the colors are a little too wild the shoe also comes in grey with black, or grey with magenta and splashes of highlighter yellow.(That one will get your attention!)

 They have the new tongue-wrap construction.  Its attached on one side which makes them easy to get into.
In my opinion these run true to size unlike some Ive tried lately which tend to run small.

5455,"Every American family should have a copy of The American Patriot's Almanac by William J. Bennett and John T.E. Cribb in their home. I was excited to get a free copy from Book Sneeze a few months ago and I've been meaning to write about it ever since.

The book is arranged by date through the year and tells of important and interesting historical details that occurred on each day. For example, on January 11th Alexander Hamilton was born. He was an orphan born in the Caribbean Islands and the exact year is not known--either 1755 or 1757. The page continues to give a quick glimpse of Hamilton's life and his contributions to America, including being an aide-de-camp to George Washington during the Revolutionary War, helping to persuade Americans to accept the constitution and writing the Federalist Papers with James Madison and John Jay.

Also on this day in 1908 President Theodore Roosevelt declared the Grand Canyon a national monument .

This book is a treasure trove of valuable information for all Americans. Besides the historical data from each day, it also includes the history of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. These documents, the Bill of Rights and Amendments to the US Constitution are included in their entirety. You can also find the Gettysburg Address, The Emancipation Proclamation and The Pledge of Allegiance. Songs, poems and prayers for the American People are included as well. A section at the back of the book lists each of the fifty states, their flag and other important information.

While Utah Dad and I have much of this additional information in other books in our library, it is especially nice to have it all combined so conveniently and beautifully in one volume. My children have enjoyed looking up the events that occurred on their birthdays.

The American Patriot's Almanac is definitely a book to add to your library. It is a rich and valuable source for every family.",3,"[-5.065118720756284, -3.972340929976281, -2.6534265346836503, 1.1317731904285402, -2.474861802952891]",1.1317731904285402

These come in pulltop cans and the contents (big stable cubes with a scattering if rice and thin gravy) slide out willingly without the aid of a utensil to wash, so you don't have to deal with throwing up a little in your mouth to feed it.

25,"I've spent hundreds of dollars on various units from Battery Tender, Schumacher, and NOCO.  My first experience was buying a Battery Tender ($49.95) to keep our entry gate properly charged so that it opened and closed when needed. The second one was a Schumacher ($154.00) that I wanted to use to charge and maintain an old 1974 Porsche 914 2.0 Liter.  Unfortunately the clips were too large to fit into the minuscule battery compartment.  However that Schumacher unit worked just fine on charging and maintaining the huge battery in my Ford Lightning.

Then came the NOCO Genius  ($99.95) which I use on another old collector Porsche, a model that would discharge the battery completely while sitting in the garage.  My best guess is that the clock is run by the battery and keeps running until the battery gives up. The NOCO took care of that problem for me as far as maintaining it, but you had to keep an eye on it while charging because our frequent power outages in Southwest Florida keep turning it off.  So for $27.38 I didn't really expect a lot of performance from this Stanley BC209 Battery Maintainer.

However, after receiving this unit, the first time that I needed to charge up a battery was for my Toro Zero Radius lawnmower.  The grass only grows moderately during our three winter months and it is easier on the lawn if you mow it and water it less during this dormant period.  However that usually causes the lawnmower battery to fully discharge.  Hooking it up was simple and the results were perfect.  After that the old Battery Tender in our gate failed and I replaced it with this Stanley unit.  After a month it is functioning perfectly even though it sits in a rusted out control/operator box in our high heat and humidity.

This charger is a great value for the money.  Battery chargers and tenders just keep getting smaller, simpler to use, and more cost effective.  You can't go wrong with this unit.",3,"[-0.33573298858041145, -0.8101996477755362, -1.7617823651914892, 1.1286374329126587, -4.1898065012209695]",1.1286374329126587

9985,"The Super Bright Glow Sticks definitely live up to their name - these are simply *the best* glow sticks I've ever used...and I go through a LOT of glow sticks.  I do a lot of party decor as a balloon twister and entertainer, and I love integrating glow sticks and LED lights into the balloon creations.  These glow sticks put other sticks to shame.  The colors are vibrant and the glow sticks are super bright - so bright that you can see the glow in day light.  They work like any other glow stick - simply bend the stick to break the vials inside, then shake the stick to distribute the chemicals together.  I photographed a glow stick from my local craft store next to the Super Bright Glow Stick - it's really not hard to see the difference.  In terms of longevity of these glow sticks - these will easily last through a party in the evening.

For those who twist balloons, the light is bright enough to be seen through an opaque 260 - this is helpful for when you're making light up roses and want the bud part of the stem to be slightly lit up, although I would stick with LEDs for the rose itself.  In the photo attached, the green part is lit up by the glow stick alone.  The red part is lit up with a strobing LED - the green part is consistently that bright, even without the LED on.

The glow sticks come in a mailing tube with 100 glow sticks.  The set also comes with 100 connector pieces to make bracelets or necklaces.  Overall, these are fantastic glow sticks - I will definitely be buying these again.

2109,"This is a wonderful, encouraging devotional!  With chapter titles like, ""God Doesn't Expect You to be 'Fine'"" and ""God Is Bigger Than Your Problems,"" the author points out truths we all need to take to heart.  Each devotional is a few pages long and quickly caught my attention with a story, either from someone else's life or her own.  She talks about what we're feeling and thinking and how God feels about what we're going through and how He loves us and understands.  She then has a prayer where she gets us started talking to God about what we're going through and we can continue the thought with space if we want to write it down.  Then there are a few blank lines to write down what we're hearing from God.  Finally, it ends with recommending 2 or 3 chapters in Psalms to read.

As I read through this, there were so many truths and reminders I needed to hear.  Sometimes it was specifically something I was having a hard time with.  The back of the book says it's the perfect companion to her book, ""You're Going to Be Okay,"" which I also loved, but they can also be used separately.  I can see myself rereading this and coming back to it again and again.  I highly recommend it!

Don't know if it's a bad design or just a badly made whistle. There are two openings - one on either side. When you cover one the sound is off, covering the other you actually get a pretty good sound.

We took it outside to try it out, I stood in the backyard and blew the whistle. Someone standing on the other side of the house in the front yard said they could barely hear it.

9663,"Only in California can one purchase a lawn mower in the middle of December and find themselves still having to mow their lawn.  My older Black and Decker finally started showing its age, and after calculating the cost of replacement parts, I figured it would be easier and cheaper to purchase a whole new mower rather than to have to buy and fix the old B&D.  I'm really quite happy with this purchase.  Knowing that I didn't quite need a wide mower, I settled for the 5"" narrower GreenWorks corded mower.  This mower is lighter, easier to maneuver, and works just as effectively as my old mower when it was in its prime.  The unit is much easier to fold down and store, and I like how the unit is not quite as loud as my old mower.  One notable improvement on the GreenWorks vs the B&D is that the little flap that keeps rocks/grass/dirt from kicking up is made of plastic instead of rubber.  On the B&D, that flap wore down and broke off incredibly quickly.  I noticed this one not only stays in place better, but I can move the mower back and forth as needed without having to worry about it getting sucked down under the mower.  One downside to this mower is that the collection bag is much smaller.  This requires me to unload a lot more frequently (particularly when I have long grass to mow!), and the bag is not quite as easily removed as the B&D.  The bag issue alone is worth the dock of star, but I'm thinking if I didn't have a point of reference, I wouldn't have known that bag removal could be that easy.

678,"An infuriating and depressing account of how the super-wealthy have quietly influenced popular discourse through the funding of think tanks and campaign contributions to bring about policies protecting their own wealth and business interests. I knew before reading this book that rich donors could have an outsized effect on election results, but I was blown away by the scope of the concerted efforts this small group of citizens has made to push the libertarian views that would lower their own tax rates and allow their businesses to cut corners with the safety of their employees and the environment.

Investigative journalist Jane Mayer notes that money is no guarantee of election results, and that there are a few wealthy individuals on the left who have put their own 'dark money' into the political system in support of progressive causes. But as she describes with overwhelming evidence, this phenomenon has largely been the domain of billionaire Republican donors like the Koch brothers seeking to buy the election results they want while keeping their own involvement hidden behind shell companies and ostensibly charitable donations. It's a problem for which there are no easy solutions -- and as Mayer shows, one that has been developing gradually for over a hundred years now -- but one that is important for anyone interested in politics to recognize.",3,"[-3.035821219176768, -2.5960579276146487, -1.726293274171123, 1.1208936503447064, -3.5763473748921073]",1.1208936503447064

185,"This is a top medical reference in the alternative medicinal area. The book discusses dietary implications based upon blood
types. For instance, Type A is the agrarian which is comfortable with grains and livestock. Blood type B people require a
balanced diet of meat and dairy. (B-Antigen)  Type AB is the modern man with an inherited tolerance of AB with enhanced
abilities to manufacture more antibodies. (A & B antigen) The blood type is key to the immune system. Blood type 0 persons have no antigens. (Anti-A and Anti-B antibodies) Type B people may have milk ; whereas, Type A people tend to have systems which agglutinate and reject it.

The author mentions an Indican urine scale for bowel putrification; wherein, the liver and intestines do not metabolize proteins. Instead; they produce indols- toxic byproducts on the Indican Scale. Foods with toxic Indicans should be avoided.  i.e. Bologna  magnifies nitrites. Lactin activity inflames the intestines, causes bloating and slows food metabolism. Wheat gluten slows the
metabolism and interferes with insulin efficiency.

Kelp, seafood, liver, kale, spinach,broccolli and red meat are ideal for metabolism and weight loss/stabilization. Bacon, ham, pork, American cheese, cheddar and ice cream should be minimized. Soy may be utilized as a good alternate to the dairy group. Flax oil and olive oil are beneficial. Corn oil and peanut oil should be avoided. Type B persons have stronger immune systems and may eat meat, green veggies, eggs, liver, licorice tea and ginger. Type AB persons benefit from TOFU, dairy , green veggies and millet.
Persons with sinusitis and Type B should avoid fenugreek. Type O persons should avoid alfalfa. Type B persons react badly to vaccines. Type A persons should avoid cayenne due to potential nausea. Type O and B should avoid aloe vera juice.

This book contains a wealth of important dietary material. It should be read carefully. The contents should be placed

Put a round glass or large decorative plate on top and you have a nice low table that will hold your drink or book and look like beautiful designer table. There is a bottom support that could also hold a small plant or decorative item.

7492,"Ive been wearing the same style number lace Bali bra for years (If it aint broke..) but I thought it would be interesting to try a new brand and style.

I received the rose beige color (sort of a pinkish beige) which is a good choice if you want the color to blend in under a light colored blouse, assuming you're beige. At least the manufacturers have finally realized that busty ladies like pretty bras, too. I remember the olden days when you paid extra for the bigger cups in your choice of white. The lace band at the top of the cups gives it a little touch of pretty but, if you have a tendency to overflow, the edge will cut in.

The strap buckles are in the front which makes them easier to adjust while you're wearing the bra. They might show through a clingy sweater but if you wear a 38DD someone is going to figure out you're wearing a bra sooner or later anyway. The straps have slight stretch to them. In my long career of wearing bras Ive never had a buckle break. It is always the wires that snap. I don't know why they don't sell replacement wires. I don't know about Vanity Fair but Bali will replace the bra if you have the receipt, like who ever keeps a receipt for a bra?

The bra seems good quality but the straps seem too wide-set and fall off my wimpy little shoulders so I won't be able to wear it. Back to the same old  U back Balisigh.

Note: Bali bras are measured under the bust around the rib cage. Vanity Fair bras are measured for the band size above the bust under the arms.

It wasn't his favorite variety (I thought), but it was turkey (his favorite protein source) and it had the texture he likes (little chunks of meat), so I figured I would give it a try.

Turns out, he likes this a lot.  Probably more than the ""tender turkey Tuscany.""  He ate it at room temperature from the can one day and cold straight from the refrigerator another day (I give him half a can a day; he also gets some dry food because he is resistant to eating only wet food).  He cleaned his plate to the point where there wasn't any residue left on it.  And he did so quickly.

I'm not thrilled about all the ingredients.  This does include some byproducts and wheat gluten.  It's probably OK in moderation for otherwise healthy cats (which is how I'm feeding it) but I wouldn't feed it exclusively.

For what it's worth, I had a hard time finding plastic lids to reseal the cans with.  But there are some that vet's offices get with Hill's prescription food that are suitable for three different can sizes.  Those fit on Fancy Feast cans.  So ask your vet if they have any of those Hill's lids they can give you, and it solves the resealing problem for the 3 ounce cat food cans.

It's the difference between the tiny, squeaky sets of speakers one would normally find in this price range and Zee mighty 523 (Z523 that is). When attached to one of the kids' laptops and fired up to near-full 40W unstoppable power, they make the movie watching or even the Youtube watching experience significantly more enjoyable.

I liked this set of speakers for:

- Ease of installation - 10 minutes tops with hardly a need to check the folded-paper, tri-lingual manual.
- The subwoofer, of course.
- Its versatility: headphones output and inputs either from a computer, MP3 player or even an Xbox, PS3 or a DVD player via an RCA wire (not included)
- Half-decent sound. You wouldn't expect anything approaching hi-fi from this class of devices but, if you keep the volume somewhere in-between, what comes out is almost okay.

Of course, not all is perfect. When the volume and the subwoofer are turned up to 'high' it hums quite loudly even when not connected to any input. The overall impression is that of 'cheap' but, for the kids room, this is EXACTLY what's needed.

The Z523 can make a kid happy if offered as a reward for a good report card. To claim anything more would be over-stretching it.

142,"In several ways this book reaches further than THE GNOSTIC GOSPELS.  It appears that Ms. Pagels ideas have ""evolved"" on the subject of Gnosticism.  She now can venture that perhaps John was a Gnostic Gospel while so-called Gnostic works should be seen as more in line with traditional documents.
The author sets out on a task that has eluded many others: The discovery of the origins of Christianity, those first years when it was still a small sect of mainly Jews whose beliefs were totally at odds with those of later generations.  And what she found was surprising - this apparently orthodox religion was never pure nor simple not were its followers in agreement on beliefs.  Instead, the movement emerged from theological and cultural conflicts and the Jesus we now know is the outcome of that battle.
Her vehicles for time travel are the newly discovered Gospel of Thomas and the John, the fourth Gospel. The reason we have four and not five or six or seven Gospels is due to the battles of theology and history.  To the victors go the spoils. She points out that John itself veers radically away from the Synoptics.
Jesus becomes God, the Creator of the Universe, his  humanity only a veneer for divinity.  Jesus the man was of no importance except for fulfilling Old Testament prophecy.
The many autobiographical references are cumbersome and get in the way of the story.

9784,"This feeder seems to work as advertised but not without some problems. In this review, I'm going to go through the problems I have encountered and let you decide for yourself if this is the right product for you.

Firstly, the feeder can tip over and spill all the food easily when it is fully elevated. It is just not stable enough with the legs fully extended and the load of kibbles on top. It has already caused me a messy cleanup and now I wouldn't extend it beyond the mid-height. Secondly, the legs aren't easy to fold back as they seem. There are clips at the bottom of the feeder to catch the legs as they are folded back. However, they don't seem to line up correctly on my feeder and are often times in the way as the legs are being folded onto them. I have to turn the feeder upside down and wiggle the legs to line up with the clips. Otherwise, the clips would get slammed and may eventually break.

The feeder bowl seems to work well though. It does a good job of lengthening a meal due to the partitioning ridges and valleys in the bowl that slow down the feeding and in turn help reduce bloats and gas. It is also removable for cleaning and is dishwasher safe (top rack).

Overall, a good concept but rather poor execution. While the removable feeder bowl works great, the adjustable legs just aren't sturdy and stable enough. I wish the legs are sturdier and the clips are done better. If you have a problem with your dog eating too fast, you may give it a try. Just be forewarned that it can tip over easily when elevated.",3,"[-3.505542513586327, -3.418676568205304, -1.3426540029060972, 1.1126066177260754, -3.7912355485557168]",1.1126066177260754

The price was so favorable that I didn't send back the black socks.  But I can really feel the difference that 1% polyester makes and I would not buy them again.  Also, if you take a pair of black socks on one hand, and squeeze, and compare to doing that with the white pair in the other hand, you'll notice a giant difference.  The black socks feel like 50% polyester.

Both the black and white socks feel pretty thick and warm.  The white ones, upon wearing and washing, have shed clumps of material.  Higher quality socks cost disproportionally more, I think.

I loved the original version of Return of the Jedi and the Special Edition takes the darkness mytery out of the Jabber the Hut scene. I mean the scene with creatures perforrning there is now turned into annoying cgi musical number. It's just goofy and doesn't belong in a scene that is meant to be dark and mysterious.  Well Lucas obviously didn't think it was meant to stay that way. The new score at the end of the Return of the Jedi as well, I think is really bad and I miss the original score. Lucas is too much into effects and todays technology. Mean look at the prequels, if he put more time into the scripts and less into the visuals, the movies might compare with the original movies. Anyway I think the original movies were fine before the special editions. Ok the Jabber the hut and Han Solo scene that was added to the original in entertaning. Some other changes like the ones to Return of the Jedi are really bad though. I heard rumors that Lucas actually wants to make Special Special Editions now but I think he hacked his beloved trilogy to bits enough.

7359,"Miles Davis-Kind Of Blue *****

To say that this, Kind Of Blue, by the man, the one and only Miles Davis is the perfect Jazz album is well a complete understatement. Kind Of Blue is THE Jazz album. To be able to put together a album so good could have only been done under the order of the great ""king of cool"" Miles. But he didn't do it alone, oh no far too easy for a man of his stature. He called upon such heavy hitters as the amazing John Coltrane to blow some sax, which is always a wise choice as he is the best. But not just Coltrane alone he also called upon ""Cannonball Julian Adderley. The great Bill Evans on piano. Jimm Cobb and Paul Chambers on drums and bass. Talk about an all star line-up. What these musicians came together to do was create the greatest jazz album of all time, and the coolest jazz album of all time, and that they did.

To sit and nit pick the album in it's completeness would be too hard. With a album full of nothing but good tracks you can't find any stand outs or any weak links. The textures of each song and the mood of all the songs bring together one of the best feelings of satisfaction at the end of the record.

'Blue In Green' being a personal favorite of my own, a true classic in Mr. Davis' musical cannon. 'All Blues' is a real classic among classics. Here you have everyone in the group especially Miles at the top of their game. The alternate version of 'Flamenco Sketches' is in my opinion superior, but thats not to say that the other is of lesser quality, quite the opposite in-fact it is fantastic. 'Freddie Freeloader' is a nice piano driven song which just an all around good feel. And as the album opens with the upbeat 'So What' which couldn't have opened the album any better then it did, it asures that this album is a sure win for any listener.

So to realease my final verdict on this album, well if you can't tell I think it is absolutly amazing. Quite simply the best album in the genra of Jazz. To any one who is even curious I do recomend this to all.",3,"[-2.7687338523404565, -4.279581476384927, -2.0116686686488117, 1.1117029800288725, -2.9443890707948497]",1.1117029800288725

7676,"While I am not on a gluten restricted diet a close friend of mine is so I have tasted my fair share of gluten free products over the past seven years. These are one of the better ones. They are a little bit of work to put together.

The recipe is simple. All I did was add butter and one egg to the cookie mix.

The recipe suggests using a stand mixer until everything comes together. The reason for this, I assume, is that the dough is thick which is not surprising since butter and an egg are the only soft ingredients. I do not have a stand mixer so I used a hand held one and it took some time for the mix to come together.  Next time I may melt the butter to see if that makes it easier.

The instructions then say to roll the dough between parchment or plastic wrap. I used wax paper which seemed to work okay. I then sprinkled some sugar on the cookies.

I then put the cookies in the oven though the instructions give the option of putting them in the refrigerator for 30 minutes and then putting them in the oven. I did a good job and none burned. I did put some butter on the cookie sheets though the instructions don't mention this.

The cookies tasted like sugar cookies.  They were a bit dry but no overly so. They tasted fine alone as well with tea.

I remember about seven years ago when gluten free products seemed to only be found in health food stores.  A lot of the products, especially desserts, were  dry and often heavy.  These cookies taste like good cookies.  They are great if you want to eat gluten free.",3,"[-2.5746789512521717, -2.0596200873118704, -1.8381136966261664, 1.1077193808404335, -3.5715001599855123]",1.1077193808404335

I piped it into my receiver and hit the power button and bingo! it found my network over it's installed handy dandy wireless network adapter (G).  It prompted me for my password, which I entered (by turning the knob, which was kind of a pain) and it connected no problem.  You can also wire your connection through the network cable slot in the back, however, no network cable was included.

After that, I chose internet radio and I had choices galore.  The real beauty of this device is how you can personalize it.  Got a Pandora account?  Pipe it through this baby with ease.  How about Live365?  You can do that too.  Want to search the internet radio via genre? No sweat.  Absolutely amazing I tell you.

I created my Grace account, added stations online and podcasts and after unplugging the device and plugging back in (yah, they tell you to do that so it updates the streams), my customization was found on the device and away I went.

Here is the absolute frosting on the cake...I'm now streaming all of my music from my laptop and external hard drive to this device!  Sort by genre, album, album artist, create a queue, you name it, this thing can do it.  This kills the Windows Media Center that never worked right with my 360.

Now when you enter the darkened rooms of those who profess to know something about human beings you will see, probably alone on a bookshelf under a hot lightbulb, this monstrosity. Hung indecorously on the spokes of all the many scientific sounding code numbers is the current drapery of Psychiatry, a field that has devolved into such meaningless paste and sap that it would take an entire new generation of thinkers to but some spine back in it. A colleague of mine recently remarked that if any other field of medicine had the cure rate of Psychiatry it would be banned as a dangerous fraud. This is no doubt true, as anyone who has labored in the mental health field knows without question that few get better, that techniques have come to a marked standstill (""maintenance"" is the key word, as in cows and sheep) and that the ""clients"" are to blame for everything. But that being said, like a country gets the president it deserves so too does a field gets the standard text it deserves, and nothing reflects the current state of Psychiatry better than this vacuous heap of cow chips, a book of such lack of imagination and insight into human nature and the functioning of the human mind that it can be credentialed as being one of the most consistent books ever written.

7639,"We bought this antenna for our mother-in-law suite so that guests could get one or two HD channels should they stay overnight.  Simple packaging, simple to connect, very low profile.  As the instructions say, you should move it around and then scan for channels each time to see where the best mounting point is.  This bedroom is in the bottom floor of our house, has metal framing, and is surrounded by mature oak trees. Mounting it high on the window surprised me with 25 channels being received.

So I moved it around to several different locations but couldn't find a spot with better reception.  Since I knew that my wife would want it to be as inconspicuous as possible, I decided to lay it flat on top of an old Victrola which was fairly close to the window.  What a surprise that turned out to be!  Now we had 44 channels in HD.  I scrolled through them just to prove it to myself and was rewarded with a confirmation on all 44.

This antenna doesn't just do what it says it will do -- it does better!  There is a reason why it's the number one best seller in antennas.

HELPFUL HINT:  One f the things I noticed when buying and testing amplified HDTV antennas is that SOMETIMES they didn't seem to do the job promised by the company.  It turns out that, depending on your distance from over the air HDTV stations, you may get horrible reception using this type of antenna.  Don't make a poor decision based on this.  Just unhook the amplifier and run it without.  Miraculously you will now get perfect reception.

Octinoxate is often used as a UV filter to protect other ingredients from degrading in certain conditions and is used in many skincare products. Octisalate is a skin penetrator and it also stabilizes avobenzone. Avobenzone absorbs the full spectrum of UVA rays. I used a little bit on my face.

Although the vast majority of the nozzle is made of plastic, it does feel like the plastic is more durable/thick than other plastic nozzle's I have owned.

Lots of variety to cycle through on the nozzle which is nice.  The ""jet"" spray didn't have the power I was quite looking for, but that may have been a water pressure issue at that time.  I will say that the actual stream on the jet spray was larger than what I was used to, so with a wider opening, that is perhaps the culprit for the weaker spray.

The sprinkler function is a great idea.  The wings fan out of the nozzle and do require a pretty good amount of tug...which is great.  Again, going to my overall impression that the device is well construction.  There are a lot of nuances to using that feature though.  The hose has to be just right, no tension that would push the nozzle over, etc.  All in all, a nice feature to use for a dry spot.

Even Christians sometimes look at current events and become fearful even though the Scriptures repeatedly say do not be afraid.  How, then, should we respond when we hear troubling news in the economy, watch the trembling of war in the Middle East and see storms heading our way?

Wallace Henley, assistant pastor of Second Baptist Church in Houston, TX and columnist for Christian Post, provides Christians hope in his book ""Globequake"" by teaching how to become unshakeable ""while the world falls apart"".

Stabilizing the family and being a part of a church family that adheres to the teaching of Scripture can help Christians become indestructible in the face of impending doom.  The world is influenced by every prevailing wind whereas Christians are called to trust in God's unchanging kingdom regardless of what is going on in the world around them. These globequakes, as Henley calls them, is an opportunity for Christians to draw closer to Christ and renew their faith.

Henley did not write ""Globequake"" in order to spark fear and anxiety.  Instead, it was written in response to the fear and anxiety he sees in Christians and non-Christians every day.  The world has been filled with crisis since the beginning.  Anchored to Christ, Christians can withstand any crisis the world dishes out.

In the past I used to put a plastic bag over the end and then wrap a rubber band around.  The problem with that (besides looking terrible) is that these caulk tubes have very low friction at the end and frequently the plastic and rubber band would come off quite easily.  These caps do a much better job.  I don't really like actually exposing the rubber to the caulk or adhesive or whatever.  So what I do is put a small square (maybe 2x2 inches) of plastic or saran wrap over the tip, then put this on top--if you want to store for a very long time and are worried about it drying, you can insert a nail in the end before putting on the plastic.  This product unwraps just like a condom. It exerts pressure all along the end of the caulk tube and goes past the plastic square...it stays on and looks good.  When you want to take them off, you just unroll from the bottom and they come off and look just like they did before use.  So you can use them over and over (if you put plastic on there first.  At Ace there are plastic caps that are intended to do the same thing but they don't work nearly as well.  Actually there are several competing products but this is by far the best.

2. I also put this on the ends of my clicky pens that I wear in my shirt pocket.  They are gel pens similar to a pilot G2.  The problem with that type of pen is that if it ever gets clicked open inadvertently, it will soak into your shirt and ruin it.  Put this over the end and that will never happen.  You can carry your pens without adding bulk to your pocket and without worrying about ruining your shirts.  Basically this is a much improved pocket protector.

Anyway, this is a great product.  These two uses are really quite important to me, so I will always keep them around.",3,"[-1.4811589272224757, -2.5360593433237257, -2.411773271594894, 1.0980969681633819, -2.834059723638213]",1.0980969681633819

Just be sure not to touch the surface and let it dry for several minutes, since the ink will smudge if you touch it, until it's completely dry. Use an inkjet with pigment based ink rather than dye based ink, since pigment ink is much more durable.

If you want ""Section 3 compliance"" where the labels are tested for abrasion resistance and permanence of print, Avery recommends the Oki C711 series laser printers and Epson ColorWorks C831 inkjet printer.

I used the wonderful web based ""Design & Print Online"" feature on the Avery website to create the labels. This generates a PDF document that you can save and print. This was quicker than using the Word templates that I used to use a long time ago.

The United States, in this work of fiction, has abandoned the Christian religion, and the world is on the brink of disaster. A scientist has decided to kill a billion people to push the survivors in to adopting his invention. The heroine is Abby Caldwell, who was raised by her parents in a remote village in the South Pacific. Abby is a devoted Christian who travels to the United States and experiences culture shock.
Abby inadvertently breaks the Tolerance Act of 2036, when she spoke critically about other religions on a news show, and she faces being arrested for that. This act reminds me of recent actual laws which ban hate speech, in the USA, Europe and in Australia and in many Muslim countries.
Sometimes fiction, even science fiction, is eerily predictive of what could happen.

I think that unless you are prepared to empty out this composter, and turn the composter yourself you will have similar results as your labor is needed to speed up the composting processes, and at this rate, you might as well put together a simple wire mesh composter.

My largest complaint with this composter is that you really do need to rotate your materials or the process is very slow.  Please note, the compost never comes out like it does in some of the pictures looking like potting soil.  It comes out a little rough, it isn't soil, but this does make good rich compost.

9330,"'The Lord of the Rings - Trilogy (Extended DVD's)' is in my estimation the greatest motion picture achievement of all-time. Why you may ask? Exactly what is my opinion based on? Let me explain.

My Reasons:
1- The first and greatest hurdle is the difficultly of adapting a film from a book (or series of books in this case) without doing damage to the literary vision of the author. You could produce an excellent movie yet fail miserably at remaining true to the original source. Ask any longtime, hardcore fan if the films retained Tolkein's vision? I'm confident you'll receive a resounding yes.

2- Secondly, 'The Lord of the Rings' boasts the best special effects to date, yet despite the technological grandeur of it's accomplishments the story and the characters within it remain first and foremost in importance. It's this retaining of it's human (or Hobbit for that matter) and emotional base within all the fantasmagoria abounding that makes it so profoundly successful.

3- Thirdly, considering the sheer length of the combined 3 films it would seem an utter impossibility for any film(s) to maintain its audience interest for so long a duration of time. Not only does 'Lord of the Rings' accompish the impossible, but it actually draws the viewer deeper into its fantasy landscape.

4- Everything else; Magnificent cast, haunting, mesmerizing soundtrack, director, crew, production values. The list is endless!

Nobody ever thought it was possible for any film to truly do justice to Tolkein's literary masterpiece. Fortunately director Peter Jackson didn't see it that way.

7787,"I like to bite into the popsicle therfore this traditional shape mold works the best for me.  I also like the star shaped molds.  The traditional shape is easier to clean and the star shape is easier to pour (wider opening) IMO.

Each mold holds 4oz of liquid.  If you are not sure about your blender, fill it up with 24oz of water (volume = 1 and 1/2 bottles of 16oz water bottle).  Empty the blender and fill it with solids and liquid before blending to the same level.  This way you will not overfill or underfill the molds.  The advice is to leave 1/2 inch not filled at the top of the mold.  Abide it because it will prevent overflow once the content is frozen.  Put molds upright on tray to pour.  When you pour, pour with care (no shakey hands).  I spill outside of the molds a few times.  All it takes is to dip the frozen treat into hot water a few seconds for easy unsheathing.  This is the easiest and healthiest way to give yourself and your family a good summer treat without breaking the bank and with years of good use.  The possibilities are limitless!

I add about 2 table spoons of ground raw black sesame into the mixture.  You can't taste it, only seeing the black flakes.  Black sesame can slow facial aging and delay graying of dark colored hair.  Use coffee bean grinder to grind it and store in a glass jar.

9665,"32 ounce Deer/Rabbit Repellent

I use this at my cabin which is in the woods with lots of deer & rabbits.  My hydrangeas have never gotten beyond 3 feet tall until I started using a deer/rabbit repellent.  The deer always browsed the new growth so the plants looked healthy but no flowers.  Since this is a vacation house, I'm not there to chase off the deer.  We have security cameras so I've seen the footage of the deer going to the bushes & walking away.  I used to have footage of the deer enjoying my bushes.

It is rain ""resistant"" & it did last through a couple rain storms in the two weeks after I applied it  although it had definitely washed off some of it.  I reapplied it just to be sure.  The 30-day claim is perhaps a bit optimistic unless there has been very little or no rain.  You also need to reapply to any new growth because it will not have the nasty flavor on it to deter the deer/rabbits from snacking.

It does have an odor until it dries but it is less noticeable than similar products I've used.  It's not very offensive; just a cinnamon/clove scent with the rotten eggs/vinegar.

This is an expensive option for deer repellant.  I really don't think it should cost this much considering  the ingredients are not unusual.  Using this with a hose is also kind of messy & maybe more wasteful than other products that don't require a hose.  I think the ""concentrate"" form would be a better choice.

And then, about a year ago, something happened.  They started burning out in less than a month.  Several of them only lasted 2 weeks.  I even tried replacing the fixtures they were in.  I used both the metal reflective types and the fixtures that are white on the inside and black on the outside.  Brand new or old, it wasn't the fixtures -- the bulbs just kept going out.

I was buying them at a physical store and inspecting them before use and nothing LOOKED out of the ordinary.  The boxes they came in were in good shape.  So it wasn't a problem with shipping, but instead with materials and/or manufacturing.

Anyway, 2 stars because they were good at one time.  Perhaps they'll fix whatever is wrong in their manufacturing process and become good again.  In the meantime, if you are looking for a replacement item, the PetSmart store brand ones have lasted me for at least 4-5 months so far and are still working as I type this.",3,"[-0.5670214180662181, -1.39775483269551, -1.490047936200273, 1.0890472989626234, -3.5649618717132068]",1.0890472989626234

US purchasers should know the UltraViolet codes do not work outside the UK. That's a big minus because you can't access the digital copies or the 2.5 hours of non-disc special features provided by Universal that are available in the US Blu-ray releases of these films (there is still 3 hours of bonus content on the discs themselves that are accessible). I would rate the films 4 stars and this release only 3 stars because it's not a deluxe collection since it only bundles the 4 stand-alone Blu-rays together in one package. Fans who own The Bourne Trilogy may opt to purchase Bourne Legacy separately (yet it remains the weakest of the franchise films). If you can buy this box set at a good price it does work well as a value pack. Ensure you get the region-free release since there is an identical Region 2/B release that does not work on US Blu-ray players.

9799,"I was really not sure what to expect from this product.  I'd read the reviews, and they ranged from ""gross"" to ""crisp and light"".
I couldn't find it locally, so finally ordered one on Amazon.

Now, I LOVE carbonated drinks. I've never bought a Soda Stream though, because there's no place around here to get canister refills, and most of the syrups were disgusting, so no point.  I've been drinking sodas, but want to wean myself off the cola type drinks. I thought this might be a good compromise, as I don't really like plain water.

I bought two brands to try - the other one (not naming it here, since this is a review about LaCroix, but it was strawberry dragonfruit. It was gross, and I love dragonfruit) was NOT good at all, so I almost didn't want to try this one!  That would have been a mistake.
This comes very close to Sierra Mist, IMHO.  Of course, it isn't the same, since there is no sweetener in it. That's right - no sugar, so salt, no fake coloring.  Clear and bubbly.  It was very good.  The colder, the better. I tried it right from the case and it was meh.  But, stuck a few cans in the fridge and let them get nice and cold (I don't always have access to ice), and it improved it a great deal.

I can see this being a regular part of my drink lineup.  It will help me not drink so many sugary sodas, but still give me the carbonation I love.
The light lime taste is nice, and I am a big fan.  You could float lime slices in it if you wanted it more pronounced.
LaCroix, you did a GREAT job with this one, and you've won me over.  Wish I could find you in our area, but I'll spoil myself and get it here until it arrives.

I don't have a laser printer so I used an Epson inkjet printer anyway. The print turned out nice and dried to a durable pigment finish. Just be sure not to touch the surface and let it dry for several minutes, since the ink will smudge if you touch it, until it's completely dry. Use an inkjet with pigment based ink rather than dye based ink, since pigment ink is much more durable.

If you want ""Section 3 compliance"" where the labels are tested for abrasion resistance and permanence of print, Avery recommends the Oki C711 series laser printers and Epson ColorWorks C831 inkjet printer.

I used the wonderful web based ""Design & Print Online"" feature on the Avery website to create the labels. This generates a PDF document that you can save and print. This was quicker than using the Word templates that I used to use a long time ago.

I tried using larger third-party wheels on the classic dremel, but those are awkward and fail miserably because of the geometry and resulting kickback.

This is basically an overgrown Dremel with the wheel in the ideal parallel orientation for cutting applications.

The nice thing is that it spins at 17,000 RPM vs. the 10,000 RPM of my Makita angle grinder.  Since this Dremel has more speed, it takes just a light touch to cut through tough materials.

All 8 metal poles were loose in box and suffered damage. Powder coated wire bottoms were all damaged, scuffed, or chipped in some way. If you don't really care about little scratches I am sure you can handle it. But I MUCH prefer the metal version of the same rack, which is what I own now.

This does look nice in theory, and the powder coating is decent. But this is a lot of metal to ship around so just be forewarned that it doesn't always come out perfect, and you cannot polish this like you can the other version.

As for the rack itself it is amazing. I love it. Each shelf is supported by plastic gap clamps which the metal slides over. The three racks are very sturdy and the wheels were even height when I got to adjusting mine correctly. I felt setting it up was pretty easy. Just make sure you know where you want your racks otherwise you have to do some adjusting, which can be irritating. When it is all set up and done it's pretty huge too. I use the bottom racks for shoes, the main cylinder for shirts, the top for denim, and the coat rack obviously for that.

7397,"When the film version of ""Mamma Mia!"" was released in July 2008, many wondered how an all-star Hollywood cast, including Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Meryl Streep, and relative newcomer Amanda Seyfried, would fare singing some of ABBA's timeless classics. Overall, the group did an excellent job, with some songs shining brightly in the pop stratosphere.

Without a doubt, the two singing stars from the film are Streep and Seyfried. The former has particularly touching vocals on 'The Winner Takes It All' and rocks on the title track, while the latter shines in 'Honey, Honey' and 'Lay All Your Love on Me'. Colin Firth puts in a decent effort with his cohorts on 'Our Last Summer', and co-stars Christine Baranski and Julie Walters make 'Dancing Queen', 'Super Trouper', and 'Take a Chance on Me' even more delectable.

Unfortunately, Pierce Brosnan's strained and often off-key attempts do detract from the soundtrack. While it was somewhat cute in the film, his butchering of 'When All is Said and Done' and 'SOS' keep the soundtrack from being a solid five stars. I do commend him for his efforts, but this is a musical, not a Bond film. I expected more.

Overall, the soundtrack to ""Mamma Mia!"" is sure to please anyone who enjoyed the movie, providing endless chances to sing along to one of the great musical films.",3,"[-4.347836426353878, -3.384299951908062, -2.2019899186129974, 1.0834262618112847, -2.2137746180181845]",1.0834262618112847

It had been getting hard to turn for awhile - I'm on a local water system that has a lot of mineral content (which is why I have a filter), and I think that there has been a gradual build-up over the years within the switch assembly that resulted in the knob breaking.

Given that I already had one of these filters, all I needed to do to install the new one was unscrew the old one and put on the new.

On first opening it up, it seemed a bit larger than what we're used to. It has a very modern, sleek look to it. We tucked it away in a corner, plugged it in and watched it do its thing.

This is very much a ""set and forget"" piece of equipment. We don't have time to be fiddling with gadgets, which makes this unit all that much nicer. You simply plug it in, and forget about it.

It detects how ""contaminated"" the air is based on the color it displays - red or green. If red, it kicks on and starts purifying. It's SUPER quiet, which was very surprising given its size. And you can definitely notice a difference in the air quality - it is much fresher. My nephew has bad allergies to dogs (we have several), but when we started using this, he was much less symptomatic.

This says it can purify a room up to 300 square feet. We have it in a room that's probably 400 square feet, and I don't have any complaints.

9780,"The I and love and you Chicken Dog Food was eaten by the VIP (Very Important Papillon), digested by the VIP, and output by the VIP - and all went well. The kibble is the perfect size for small dog - each heart shaped piece is flat and about the size of a pea.  Because of the flattened shape, it's easy for both small and medium dogs to eat without having to work too hard.  As an added bonus, these don't roll around like round kibble does.  Like most kibbles, my dog wasn't terribly excited about eating it, but he did eat it, unlike some other kibbles. When mixed with his raw diet, he ate it without spitting it out - overall, there must be something right with the flavor since he didn't spit any of it out. He didn't have any stomach issues when eating this kibble, nor did he have any issues when it came out digested.

The first few ingredients include chicken, chicken meal, turkey meat, lentils, chickpeas, pea protein, chicken fat, dried beet pulp, dried sweet potatoes, duck, pea starch, whole ground flax seed and natural flavoring. I'm not particularly thrilled about seeing the chicken meal (derived from the 4D - dead, dying, diseased, and disabled animals), as well as the beet pulp, and natural flavoring a - but in comparison to other dog foods which include excessive fillers, this dog food isn't all that bad. The remainder of the ingredients include a mix of vitamins, other dried ingredients (carrots, chicory root, lettuce, etc), and fermentation products.  I'm assuming the pre and probiotics included help with digestion for my dog - similar to yogurt - and for the most part, the ingredients list is much better than conventional filler filled cheaper dog food.

Overall, if you're looking for a better than average dog food, this is a good one to consider. Like all dog foods, taste for the dog is highly subjective - if you can get a sample size to try on your dog, you can see if your dog actually eats this before committing to buying a huge bag.",3,"[-3.084855152568022, -2.6360803014249945, -1.8573817854442745, 1.0770269930630856, -3.33344644526893]",1.0770269930630856

This OXO Good Grips product claims to cut, pit and slice the avocado.  And for the most part it does.  The top green part will cut a ripe avocado in half (well to the pit) The center part is to remove the pit.  And the bottom scoops and slices the flesh of the avocado out.

The cutting piece works well but might have some problems if the avocado is not completely ripe.  The pitter does not work well at all.  I used it on a perfectly ripe avocado and it did not remove and hold the pit, the pit just fell on the floor.  I would guess with a under ripe avocado, it would not remove the pit at all.  For the slicer, it would work fine with a standard size avocado but any other size, it will not remove the meat of the avocado entirely.  Also since this is plastic, if the avocado is not completely ripe, it will not work.  And finally, this will work best with Haas avocados as the thicker skin makes removing the fruit easier.  With a Bacon avocado, it might tear the skin since it is so thin.

Since I am spending more time photographing people, and proper skin tones are so important, I knew then that I would need to buy a unit to calibrate frequently, so put the Spyder on my Amazon Wish List at that time, hoping for a better price. When a large discount was offered in the Daily Deals last week, I clicked the order button right away. (This is a plug for the Amazon Wish List; when you add items, Amazon will prompt you when a better price is announced.)

Today, I installed the software, activated my Spyder unit and recalibrated.

I just had to manually adjust the brightness on my Dell U2412M monitor. I set the calibration interval for one month, but may do it more often since the process is so streamlined.

This is the same stuff I get on a smaller scale for use in the kitchen (baking, putting in the water for boiling bagels and pretzels, etc.) and deodorizing the refrigerator.  But I wanted a huge package (I got the 64 ounce box) because I needed it to neutralize the acid etchant solution I was using for copper and, being new at this craft, I wasn't sure how much I would need.

This is more than enough to last me a long time, as it turns out.  Do proceed with any kind of acid neutralization slowly, as you will get carbon dioxide production (i.e., bubbles) and you don't want to overflow your container.  If you are making bath salts or similar, this is a more economical choice than the smaller packages.  This was free flowing and non-clumpy in the package.  (64 ounces is not practical for everyday baking, you'd want a smaller container than that unless you run a commercial bakery...)

One thing I like is that this isn't hygroscopic -- it doesn't pick up water from the environment if left open.  Which is good because it's in a big cardboard box and isn't really recloseable (is that a word?).  So it will be good pretty much indefinitely (as long as the box is not sitting directly in water).  Even those little bugs that get into pasta and grains in the pantry don't invade this stuff.

It can be used just about anywhere in the world (100-240V) for as long as you have the proper plug adapter. It should not be used with any of the Kindle Fire models.

To charge a Kindle you will need a generic USB Type A/Micro B cable and one is supplied with every Kindle purchased and you can do it in several different ways:

- Off a laptop or PC through one of their 'powered' USB ports (you will need a laptop or a PC)
- With this adapter which comes with all Kindle 3s or can be purchased separately (you will need the Amazon-supplied or any generic USB cable)
- With a third-party, branded or generic USB charger (search Amazon for either 'kindle charger' or 'usb charger')

This specific charger works for all 3d and 4th generation Kindles and is also great for charging lots of other gadgets that get charged through an USB port. I'm using it to charge my Blackberry Torch, a couple of other phones and the kids charge their MP3 players. And the reverse is also true: most other USB chargers will work with your Kindle. One good example is the Blackberry's.

You aren't getting the cheapest humidifier out there but it certainly isn't high end either.  But for what you are paying, what you are getting is pretty reasonable.  This unit works best for a small to medium size room and won't handle anything bigger.  It's easy to clean and I run mine continuously on low and each tank fill will last an estimated 12 hours.

But for most people they want not just a humidifier that will last but also one that is easy to maintain.  At this price point if regular maintenance is done it should last a couple of years but the daily handling of the unit may be an issue for some.  It is easy to damage or break this unit.  The water tank is extremely heavy when filled with water so you must have a strong grip on the tank when carrying it for if it bumps into anything or is accidentally dropped the plastic breaks easily.  Also the simple job of placing the tank into place on the unit must be done very carefully for there is a wierdly placed plastic piece that can easily be broken if the tank hits it.  Water will pour out and the unit will be damaged for good.

Israel is a very fine country whose history of perseverance can serve as a model for many developing states.  I hope someday to visit this country.  However, to listen to politicians and the media, Israel can do no wrong, and if anyone offers any critical commentary, the Christian evangelicals and pro-Israeli associations roundly condemn you.

Now I ask, what has all of this gotten anyone or improved Israel.  Are Israelis safer and Palestinians pacified?  I say, it is because of this hands-off approach by Bush and others that led to the recent debacle for Israel in Lebanon and to the images such as Israeli tanks (actually U.S. tanks) destroying homes and the killing children walking on the beach.  All this just to prevent honest dialogue?  People on both sides are dying and you worry about debating points??

President Carter points out that Israelis can talk about these issues, but not Americans.  Carter's book provides an excellent entry into the current state of affairs on these issues.  I did not get from this work that he is trying to enrich himself or say that it is ""his way or no-way.""  His main point is to open discussion.

This twist turban towel is super easy to use - leaning forward with your hair hanging down, twist the long skinny part of the towel that is hanging down until it's fairly snug around your head, then take the small loop of elastic at the very end and bring it up and over to the button that's on the towel at the back of your head.  The towel stays snug yet not too tight, and doesn't slip off at all.  I let the towel stay on while I dry off, get dressed and brush my teeth and by then all of the excess water has been absorbed from my hair.

I hadn't seen ""Live at Pompeii"" in many, many years. I didn't even know that a new ""Director's Cut"" had been released, so I was quite intruiged by this.

""Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii"" (171 min.) starts off with the ""Director's Cut"" (91 min; in 16:9 widescreen). I was a little surprised to see all the additional space footage, I mean how weird is it to see International Space Station footage from (I'm guessing) the 1990s in a concert film that was filmed in late 71/early 72! I also couldn't quite understand the logic behind adding footage (not concert footage, even) from the band messing around at Abbey Studios on various ""Dark Side of the Moon"" material. All rather strange. The original film (60 min; in 4:3 full screen) is also included, thankfully. While I prefer watching the widescreen ""refit"", the original shorter movie makes a lot more sense musically and thematically. ""Echoes Part I"" and ""Echoes Part II"" bookend the fantastic Pompeii-filmed set.

Am I the only one to think that as it relates to the Pompeii-filmed footage, Nick Mason had an inordinate amount of screen time? I'm thinking as much as the other three combined. You can't as much as catch a glimpse of Roger Waters until well into ""Echoes Part I"" for some reason. The DVD contains a 15-20 min. interview with the director Adrian Maben, and it's interesting hearing him talk about the intent of making this the ""anti-Woodstock"" film, with no spectators instead of the ""million"" at Woodstock.

Here is the problem, it is very difficult to get onto the Kindle screen without creating visible air bubbles under the clear film. MarBlue  includes two screens in the kit and it was not until the second one, having thrown away the first one, before I was able to do a satisfactory job. The directions are in pictures only, and seem clear, but what was needed were some tips and techniques to apply the screen. There is a plastic protection over the actual protector film on the front and back. It is clearly marked. I was directed to remove the bottom plastic and then apply the remaining two layers. I tried unrolling the plastic as I applied the film, over and over and over again. It got worse each time. I then noticed tiny bits of dust and bubbles of air trapped under the film. I had cleaned it well before applying. I found that the smallest piece of dust would create a bubble. Constant vigilance and cleaning are required. A spray can of air would be helpful.
The second time around I removed the plastic piece entirely from the film, applied the film in one quick motion. The dry winter air contains plenty of unseen particles to create a problem. Doing it quickly is important. There was a lot of bubbles, but no dust particles. I then pressed the bubbles toward the closest edge with the soft cardboard piece and removed them all. Some pressure is required, but don't overdo the number of times you press the bubbles toward the edge. Lastly the top plastic was removed.
