It features a slim design so it can fit in tight places. It lasts about four hours per charge and doesn't dim very much as the charge goes down.  Which leads me to the two things I dislike about it.  One, the unit I received for review flickers quite a lot, and it's VERY noticeable when working on objects near the light.  It tends to stop flickering near the end of the charge..  It's annoying, but it's possible I simply got a defective unit.  Second, there is no warning that I can detect when the charge gets low. The unit just turns off completely until you recharge it.  A pre-warning flashing red LED on the unit would be a big help to anticipate its impending shutoff.

I am not a prude and I do like to read sex scenes - who doesn't? - but when the plot appears to be there just to connect the sexual scenes, it gets boring pretty quickly.

The other disappointment was that there was no ending.

9399,"I watched this with a friend of mine who is very forgiving of modern comedies...and he thought it was as wretched as I did.

There are so many things that are so wrong about this movie but the worst aspect of ROLE MODELS is that it is NOT funny.

I don't know who Paul Rudd is, but he has zero screen presence.  I sat through his abysmal movie THE TEN and could not for the life of me understand what kind of person would laugh at that.  In ROLE MODELS, he plays a selfish jerk with no redeeming qualities.  He's not funny.  His acting is flat.  His character goes nowhere.  You never believe for a second that a severely-wasted Elizabeth Banks could ever care about a lout like him.

My friend turned me about halfway through and asked, ""Do you think the studio people screened this and thought they had a winner here?""
To the people who made this movie, it's all about formulas and the deal.  Get Stiffler from AMERICAN PIE and McLovin from SUPERBAD and you can't miss...no matter how awful the final product is.

I hated SUPERBAD, which had absolutely zero laughs in it.  Although ROLE MODELS did manage to have a couple of weak chuckles, it had so many dead air misfires that it was more embarrassing than SUPERBAD.

Another lame, horrible ""comedy"" by someone (Paul Rudd) whose talent has been exhausted (like Seth Rogan) and yet they keep making movie after movie.  That's Hollywood.

The narrator, David Patrick Kelly appeared to have an almost Southern lilt to his voice at the outset of the story that came across like an attempted impersonation of Matthew McConaughey, but as the story progressed he did gather momentum as he changed the tone and inflection of his reading and ultimately did a pretty good job with the material he was given.

And now - on to my opinion of the story itself.  I can probably sum it up in one concise word, LACKING.  It is lacking in character development, lacking in a cohesive plot and definitely lacking in credibility. Why even the ""romance"" is lacking from what I assume is intended to be the romantic aspect of the tale.

What is not lacking in this telling is a seemingly indestructible protagonist who has more lives than Bruce Willis in a Die Hard movie as well as a plethora of scenarios depicting guts and gore. If folks dying via gunshot wounds, car crashes, being thrown from a balcony, having a bomb strapped to their back or having their eyeballs expertly cut out in the middle of a busy restaurant are things that get your juices flowing- well then, this is the book for you.

Then I read the review in The New Yorker, which was much more favorable, so I said to myself that if The New Yorker liked it that much, I should give it a chance.  My gut instinct was right.  The premise is interesting, and some parts of the book were nicely done, but overall it was really no better than so-so.

The book's problems include that (1) the basic premise, while interesting, is somewhere between real and alternate history, so it's not possible to suspend disbelief; and (2) major aspects of the plot (womanizing young Jack Kennedy falls for a gorgeous, mysterious and very tough broad) and the dialogue are so trite that it seems like something out of a bygone era (and I don't mean that as a compliment).

The good: I finished the book! Something good about it kept me going. It was mysterious and intriguing to follow these characters as they tried to make some sense out of this situation and re-learn both themselves and others around them. I was supportive of the characters' slow but sure attraction to each other, despite what they gradually learned about their past behavior. The characters have potential and apparent motivation to be better than the person they were, and I liked that about them. I was genuinely curious, and very eager to get my many, many questions answered. That combined with my emotional response after finishing the book, although quite negative, at least shows that I was very much invested in the story.

The bad: I was confused! The concept that the characters' situation was based on made no sense at all. (See spoiler) From the first page to the last page, I had so many questions that went unanswered...and then the stupid cliffhanger! It was unnecessary. Why publish a 140 page book that ends right in the middle of a climactic scene instead of just publishing a full-length novel that allows the reader to gain a full experience? And the next installment won't be released until May 2015??? I think Never Never should be marketed as a serial instead of a series...that would make more sense and would at least give readers a heads up to what they are getting into. Yes, I know it's the author's right to organize their work as they see fit, but I did not enjoy my experience and because I don't want a repeat, I won't be continuing the series. The end.

OMG! I have a new favorite author! This book is amaze balls! I fell in love with the cover at once and the summary sounded really good, but I had no idea how awesome this book was going to be!

I love the world. I love, love, love the characters! The strong women characters are fantastic. Not that it's just about women. I love Zelie's brother Tzain too =)

I love the creatures they ride that are part of their family. I love the world and the magic system. Lets just say I love everything about it!

I recommend this book to anyone that loves fantasy books. READ IT!

This is a coloring prayer journal that gives you lots of beautiful art to color in and each page is uniquely different. There are amazing prayers throughout as well Scripture to meditate on. I loved writing down what was on my heart as I read the prayers and the Scripture on the lines provided. I like that they give you quite a bit of space to write down your thoughts or prayers.

The pictures to color in are really nice! There are animals, landscapes and more gorgeous things for you to color in. The pages are good quality and handle the colored pencils I used really well. Everything is wonderfully put together and has become a huge favorite of mine.

9275,"This film reminds me of Gaspar Noe's Irreversible, in that it's initially an assault on the senses, and you feel as if you've seen great filmmaking because of it.  When I revisisted Irreversible recently, I found out I'd been had.  Noe's film is just an assault on the senses with nothing in its core.  Aronofsky's film, while nowhere as overly graphic, sadistic or disgusting as Irreversible, has this same quality.

As many have said here, the main message here is a very simplistic one, DRUGS ARE BAD.  It's almost on the level of an after school special, and that's a shame, as Aronofsky has a very good visual and editing style, but after nearly 2 hours of it, it's overkill.  I felt totally numbed after seeing this film.  I sat in my car afterwards, and I couldn't move.  But aside from the pure visceral experience of the film (which feels like a drug, the drugs the movie is telling us not to use), there isn't much left there.  There's some depth in Ellen Burstyn's character (she gives a great performance), but I believe that has to do with the fact this is based on Hubert Selby Jr.'s book.  If there is any humanism in this film, it's derived from the novel, not Aronofsky, who is like a kid with his new toy.  The characters of Leto and Connelly are especially bad, especially Connelly.  She is supposed to be a junkie, but she looks way too beautiful to be one.  Overall, the film is worth watching at least once, but it's essentially a visceral assault on your senses and little else.

A funny sidenote...Before this film screened (I saw it in a theater), the theater was playing The Wallflowers's album Breach, which is one of my favorite albums of theirs.  After I recovered from this assault, I kept thinking about how wonderful and tuneful those songs were, and I pretty much forgot about Aronofsky's film (until I wrote this review).  I bought Breach, and it's one of my favorite albums.

Lauren Layne is my number one author. She is my go to girl when I need to read a good book. You know, when you are in a rut and want a GOOD book??? Lauren is it for me. She is my spirit animal. My soulmate. My fav. She is it for me.

Someone Like You had me giddy and wiggling all around when I read it. When I was reading the book, Adele was playing in my head. I was signing her version of ""Someone Like You"" and thinking, this book is as good as the song!

I feel in love with Lincoln the second the book started. Swoon!! He is my everything wrapped in one. He is sensitive and sweet and handsome and sarcastic all rolled into one !

Then there is Daisy. I can't not think of one bad thing to say. She was awesome in her own rite. When you put them together, you have something special. Alone, they are good, together they are better. See, each of them has their own past (but don't we all) and when they become friends, they complete each other. Friends turned lovers is one of my favorite type of reads. So this one was a win for me!!

Then there was the h spineless behavior, where everyone can manipulate her to do whatever  they wanted....and we are talking about a 25 year woman who was a teacher.  Then we have the scenes with the H, whose problems are not revealed until about 85 percent of the book.

The removable egg attachment is too floppy, which drops a star.  The whole unit gets very hot and takes quite a while to cool down.  A floppy middle section can be dangerous.  It has to sit open to cool off.  Update to this paragraph:  I got the hang of this and don't have a problem with any of the parts.  I keep it on its own silicone trivet.  Close the lid and lift by the back foot and hinge where it's not hot.  Easy to move.  Very easy to remove the middle section and toss in soapy water to soak.  Wipe out the top and bottom plates and any gunk I slopped on it.

I'm experimenting with different kinds of bread.  I like is the Thomas English muffins.  They're so tiny and flimsy, though, they don't hold the egg, cheese, ham well.  I can't find the Thomas sandwich size.  The Thos bagel thins are pretty bad tasting.  I found some wonderful sourdough bread loaves she cuts about 3/4"" thick.  Perfection.

Bought the dual sandwich maker, too, for baking biscuits to use as the bread.  I haven't experimented in other sandwich recipes, except grilled cheese.  That turned out quite good.  I think I made a sandwich on the bottom and one on the top section.

This book had everything I look for in a book. It was definitely a page turner. Keeping my hooked from beginning to the end. This book has everything I enjoy in a great read! It was full of angst, heartbreak, love romance, and my stomach was on a roller coaster of feelings and I loved it.

This book really centers around Chloe and Gavin. They are childhood best friends, that love each other. But because of different circumstances and people. They never really act on their feelings. Through out this book you will see these two fight what they feel and be afraid to show them,  These two story like any good book will leave you frustrated.  Watching them miss opportunities and watching the stubbornness that lead to miss moments was sometimes that drove me crazy. There were parts in this book that made me cry, made me laugh and made me swoon.  Like I said every emotion was it with this story!

There was also too much other stuff going on in the book. I think it had the potential to be good, but it seems like she didn't put enough effort into it. I must say I really didn't love this series.

Oh my goodness!!! What can I possibly say??? This book is excellent and such a phenomenal look into Sam and Tiel's life!!! If you read my review from Necessary Restoration then you know I absolutely did not like Tiel. But let me tell you that this book completely redeemed her!!! In such a way that I feel so bad about dissing her that I want to apologize and start over with her after this book. Im so sorry Tiel. Please forgive me. Anyway it was my extreme dislike for her as to why I put off reading this book for so long. I cannot believe I was so stupid and am kicking myself so hard!!! This book is fantastical!!!  and Im so glad I finally read it!!!

We see Tiel's and Sams relationship in a way that puts everything into perceptive and you cant help cheering them on. You feel their happiness and pain. Oh my god the pain. It tore my heart apart. I can relate all too well with their loss. Kate did such a wonderful  job drawing me in it was as if I was on the sidelines experiencing everything with them. It was emotional it was raw and so very real. So devastating. But the happiness was so consuming and just as powerful!!!

This books is exceptional!!! And after reading it I now believe that Sam and Tiel's relationship is one of the best. They are there for each other no matter what the situation is. They love fiercely. They live by their rules. And if no one likes well thats just too bad. Im so glad that their story wrapped up the way it did. I personally believe their HEA was the best.

What an amazing, heart wrenching, jaw dropping book this was.  Now, I loved Jackson, but holy hot dayuum Liam just stole my heart and RAN!  This book, the feelings, the emotions Just Wow! The minute you pick up Consolation, her writing just sucks you in and you won't put this one down until you reach the end.  Even then, youll keep swiping your kindle like a maniac because you will want more!

Natalie is grieving the loss of her husband.  The day that knock came to the door, was the day her life was changed forever.  Raising a beautiful baby girl on her own Aarabelle, Natalie pushes through to get through her daily routine.  She is hurt, lost and just feels abandoned by her late husband.  He promised he would come back, but promises aren't always kept.  Like any good mother, she picks herself up and gets through the day but is she really living?

My life is gone.  My heart is dead.  Im a widow at twenty-seven - Natalie

Insert Liam Dempsey into the picture.  Holy mother of gawd this man is just pure perfection.  He is gorgeous, honest, sweet and so caring.  He is a current SEAL and was Aarons best friend.  He steps in and helps Natalie even though she doesnt think she needs any help in things that need to be taken care of once you lose someone.  But, he offers so much more.  You cant help who you fall in love with, even if it seems forbidden and wrong, the heart wants what it wants.

I shouldnt want this but I do.  I shouldnt be comfortable in his arms.  But I am.  I should make him leave and put some distance between us.  But I cant.  - Natalie

This was an exceptionally written story.  You will laugh, you will cry, you WILL SCREAM at your kindle.  These are all guarantees while you read.  You WILL fall head over heels with Natalie and Liams story.  I absolutely cannot wait for Conviction.  Congratulations Corinne on another amazing story!  6 Stars!

9385,"One of the other reviewers compared the movie to a combination of Legally Blonde and Revenge of the Nerds.  That is pretty accurate.  Fans of Anna Faris know that she has very good comedy acting chops (from the scary movie franchise and Waiting).  She is definitely not afraid of saying or doing something totally stupid and ridiculous.  She pulls off the ditzy Playboy Bunny, with a kind heart and smarter than she seems quality very well.  There is definitely not a lot of depth to the character she was trying to play, but what depth there was, she played it well.

The movie has mix of stars who have become A list or B list (mainly Emma Stone and Kat Dennings which the movie did an awesome job of making look plain and downright unattractive respectively before the ""makeover"") with reality tv stars, musicians and lots of cameos from celebrities.  Even though it was not meant to be a movie that was going to win the actors any awards, the fact that at least some of the stars had the ability to act made it as good a movie as it is.  It is definitely not a movie designed to make you think, and it is definitely making fun of the whole fraternity/sorority culture.  It did not try to do too much and pretty much stuck to the comedy that it was meant to be.

This is not a movie that will appeal to everyone.  It is for the most part a mindless comedy that is not meant to, or try to make you think very much.  It had a lot of cute girls in skimpy outfits and/or showing lots of cleavage.  If that is not the kind of movie that entertains you, skip it.

25,"I've spent hundreds of dollars on various units from Battery Tender, Schumacher, and NOCO.  My first experience was buying a Battery Tender ($49.95) to keep our entry gate properly charged so that it opened and closed when needed. The second one was a Schumacher ($154.00) that I wanted to use to charge and maintain an old 1974 Porsche 914 2.0 Liter.  Unfortunately the clips were too large to fit into the minuscule battery compartment.  However that Schumacher unit worked just fine on charging and maintaining the huge battery in my Ford Lightning.

Then came the NOCO Genius  ($99.95) which I use on another old collector Porsche, a model that would discharge the battery completely while sitting in the garage.  My best guess is that the clock is run by the battery and keeps running until the battery gives up. The NOCO took care of that problem for me as far as maintaining it, but you had to keep an eye on it while charging because our frequent power outages in Southwest Florida keep turning it off.  So for $27.38 I didn't really expect a lot of performance from this Stanley BC209 Battery Maintainer.

However, after receiving this unit, the first time that I needed to charge up a battery was for my Toro Zero Radius lawnmower.  The grass only grows moderately during our three winter months and it is easier on the lawn if you mow it and water it less during this dormant period.  However that usually causes the lawnmower battery to fully discharge.  Hooking it up was simple and the results were perfect.  After that the old Battery Tender in our gate failed and I replaced it with this Stanley unit.  After a month it is functioning perfectly even though it sits in a rusted out control/operator box in our high heat and humidity.

This charger is a great value for the money.  Battery chargers and tenders just keep getting smaller, simpler to use, and more cost effective.  You can't go wrong with this unit.",4,"[1.2842805981704237, 0.8465580696043369, -0.672876165531279, -1.0447566313621777, -1.856477483606353]",1.2842805981704237

4348,"I didn't get along with the oddly constructed book. I say oddly constructed because it starts with an apparent execution but the next chapter the apparent victim carries on as if nothing happened. The key is that the chapters aren't time sequenced so the second chapter takes place before the first but no indication of that exists in the text. Instead one must reason it out. The execution scene picks up again at about the 80% point which does resolve several threads left loose from the get go.

Thats not the only disconnect I had here. There were many references and simple word usages which baffled me. Likely a good deal of my being lost was due to the book being placed in the context and word usage of the UK, however the references to the music and other pop culture figures which likely add dimension to this book for some, left me utterly at sea. Id say I didn't get a single music reference in the first part of the book. The second part improved my score to maybe 50% but I still was made to feel like an ignoramus by the author.

The book takes place in Ulster, Ireland where nobody exists without being labeled by his or her religion and judged by same. So everybodys a Prod or Finian and either hated or accepted based in the observers hatred or love for one superstition or the other. This is a perfect example of people killing each other over who has the better imaginary friend.

I grew so tired of the religious hatred, constant labeling of everybody based on their religion that the book became a weary slog for me. I didn't care for any of the characters finding the good or bad guys good or bad factions depended on the particular power balance at any given time. The IRA does disgusting acts as do the Loyalists if they get a chance.

The bad guy becomes obvious at about the 50% mark but by that time in the book, the persistent hatreds and annoying references to obscure figures of pop culture had worn me down to the point where I didn't care. The final act does contain a good deal of action unlike the balance of the book but that, while well done, couldn't save it for me. My wife wishes to tour Ireland. If we do go, Ill for sure to avoid Ulster. I owe the book that much.",2,"[1.283238954929526, 0.6043902598950393, 0.10557609704358106, -1.0316424031279128, -1.820066432001098]",1.283238954929526

8999,"I have a love-hate-kind of dislike relationship with this book. I loved it because it was the Sinners but I hated it because it was the end. The thing I disliked is i felt like there was this huge part of the storyline that was just swept under the rug unresolved.

Maci was a big part of the story of Danny and Skye. And there is one part where Maci says something that could have been a huge deal. But it's like it'd never ever addressed. So if it wasn't being addressed why did it happen. Someone can't run their mouth, say something like that and we done a- shut a b! tch down or 2- mention it to the man. We don't just never talk about it ever again. Also, her wall home. Why did that happen if it was never brought up again and everything was fine and dandy. Why did he always make her feel like it was his job if it was never discussed. Just alot felt like it was left unfinished. Loose ends that should have been tied up.
The other thing I didn't like about this is now that the clubs merged, I don't know who is who. When names were given and people were upset, I had no idea who they were...but they kind of sounded like they mattered.  It's almost like we need a family tree. There is just too many people involved at this point.

I think the relationship between Danny and Skye was heartbreaking in the beginning. What she did. The heart shattering run ins they would have. It was just hard. I'm glad they made it through, but boy did Skye make a job out of running. It seemed like she spent the first half running from everything at every turn.

It has romance, drama, love and sexiness that make this book and the series highly sensual and insanely attractive!

The story is as complex as it is simple. It is intriguing, intense and melts your heart and mind. It brings you up and tears you down. It is a ride you do not want to miss. This is a journey you have to follow through.

The characters grow both individually and as a couple. They get stronger and overcome every hurdle comes their way. Its not easy, but then; what is? Certainly not love.

Embry and Luke have been through so much. And yet, their love is strong as ever. Even they think everything is lost. Even when things get dark and uncertain. Their love is still there. They are still there for each other. No matter what.

Embry and Lukes love is breathtaking and absolutely mindblowing.

It is epic.

""Nothing in my life has ever felt as perfect as being inside of you.""

""You are special.  You're the most special person in the world to me.  I don't know how to make you see and feel that.""

I brushed his hair out of his stricken face with a soft touch, wanting to comfort the things I saw in his eyes so clearly.  It was such a reflection of my own torment.  His soul was a mirror of my own. Perhaps his insane claim that we were made for each other wasn't so very far off the mark.  I had known him for such a short time, but somehow I felt I could read him so perfectly, so naturally, that it astounded me.

I honestly have no idea what to expect from this short story when the author approached me to review his book. I never read his book before, but the blurb was intriguing, and seems like my kind of book. So I gave it a try and I was happy that I tried this.

This is an action packed book, very fast pace, that left me nicely breathless at times. It was gripping and enchanting. I really want to know why this person did what he did, but hey, psychotic person didn't need reason. Still, I was curious.

It is a shame really as the story of the 47 Ronin is a great one and if the filmmaker had been allowed to adhere to it more closely I bet this movie would have been fantastic.

1982,"This (hopefully) last ""Legend"" tale was the worst.  Like other reviewers, I devoured the original series and even liked the three ""family"" series.  But something changed in the ""Legends"" Series - the story not only got off track but introduced elements that were disconcerting in the least.

Where to start? The sadism was so bad that when Erasmus or one of the Titans drew near to a human I skipped ahead, unable to stand any more elevated rationalizations from these monsters. Besides, we are never told why they act as they do - what drove them to this madness? Speaking of madness, the cult of Serena was one of the wackiest ever.  The idea of unarmed mobs taking over a governnment was absurd.

Then we had those interminable battle scenes that were the epitomy of dullness. The conversations among the robots were  ridiculous, more like something on Mystery Science Theater. There were too many characters and the hero (Vor Atriedes)remained distant, never acquiring a personality.  Also the characters made decisions totally ""out of character"" again and again. The writing style (three pages/chapter) is annoying, making it seem like a series of vignettes instead of a seamless tale.

On the plus side, we learn the origins of the Spacing Guild  (Norma, my favorite character, appeared briefly). The origins of the Bene Geserit - more an accident than a purposeful event - was a good saga. We learn why the Harkonnens are hated, the Atriedes admired and the Corrinos in command. I hope the authors move on to other things...drop the robots, the battles and get on with the mythology.",2,"[0.26839404791101007, 1.1445720928476657, 0.46978798678398115, -1.0377682735494547, -2.1394813263162917]",1.1445720928476657

This is the second book of the Darkly, Madly duet and let me tell you; you are going to be hooked. Th words, the plot, the twists and turns, everything is just perfect. I could snot put it down, the suspense and the what will be happening now just get me more and more thrilled. Every turn of the page got me wanting more and more.

The way the main characters complement each other is over the top. Grayson is dark, raw and the psychological hot burn that he gave you is off the charts. The story had everything you could ask; the questions were answered and the conclusion that the author gave us was perfect.

The author don't disappoint me at all and with this book she gave you all. The whole ride was intense, brilliant and will keep you hooked from the beginning till the end. Definitely will be recommended to everyone.

This was not the case here, unfortunately. I did NOT dislike the book, I found it ""good enough"" and it did keep me interested.

The problem I had with it was that it felt very scattered to me and confusing, hard to follow. I kept having to refer to the ""cheat sheet"" list of characters in the back of the book, Thank you Cindy for that page, without it I would have really been lost.
Usually in a book there is a plot and maybe a sub-plot. I felt that there were really 4 plots to this book. Any one of them would have made a very good story in itself, but thrown all-together it was kind of hard for me to follow. At one time I even flipped the page back and forth looking at the page numbers, sure I had missed a page.
I loved the story of Lena, the school teacher, and wished she had focused more on that story alone.
I also felt that way too much was happening at the same time in that small Amish community. I found myself saying ""Wow this community is crazy!"" again, any one thing would have been great, but I felt it was too much going on to be believable.

Let me finish by reinstating that I did LIKE this book, I just didn't love it like I did all her others. I don't feel that was her best one. This book did get some very good reviews from others, so maybe I am just being too picky.

I hate to give top rating to a book with crude sexual remarks and scenes in addition with some profanity, but this was truly a well-written book with a great story. Of course I cannot share it with my family and friends because of embarrassment. It was so good I could barely put it down. It is a shame good writers cannot see their talents and literary abilities is great enough they do not have to muddy the story up with sexual explicitness or outward profanity.
This is a tender story of a woman becoming a 'mail order bride'after losing her only child. She wasn't totally honest in her letters and had 'friends' write her references to become the man's bride and mother to his children. She couldn't tell him she had been raised in a saloon and her mother was one of the 'working' girls. She had not chosen that life for herself and only wanted out of there. Things seemed OK at first but her past seemed to keep getting in her way. She didn't think she could ever love again nor bear another man to touch her.

It has your prerequisite 'strong, independent' heroine, who actually is anything but, as well as the typical testosterone fueled steroid case 'hero'...the growling, glowering, 'take charge' fellow who will aggravate, titillate, and quicker than quick seduce the idiotic heroine.  Yippee...

But I re-read it yesterday and was horrified at the author's bigotry, and horrified at myself for not challenging it the first time. I can only blame my ignorance, but the author has clearly researched the subject and should have known better.
The villain in the story is an inter-sex person who developed ""abnormally"" and suffered abuse during childhood and adolescence.
It was interesting in that I knew nothing about this condition before and this book yesterday prompted me onto Google and Wikipedia, but abhorrent in the way that the author abused outdated, disproven and prejudiced 1960s/1970s research to categorise the condition as unnatural, disgusting and evil.

It is such a touching, emotional book, but with such hope and peace in it that you will be amazed.
  It really would be a great help to someone who is going through losing a loved one and feeling all alone. This book The Color of Rain is really a precious story.
  Gina and her husband have two little boys and then Gina's husband gets cancer and passes away after several years of fighting it.
  Michael and his wife have two boys and one girl and then Michael's wife gets cancer, but passes away in a matter of weeks. Both of those chapters are so touching and heartbreaking, but full of faith and love.
  Both of the people who pass away went to school together.  So they know of each other and have meet each other at their children's school.
  Then Gina tries to give Michael support because she went through death first and she is a great help, but Michael is a help to her also.
  They share much in their lives and their children become the best of friends. So this is a very special story that takes you through many different stages in life, loss and healing. I really do love this book and know it is a book you will want to read. I highly recommend The Color of Rain for you.

The book really is written for a more scientific audience and the casual reader soon finds himself bogged down in medical terminology, endless footnotes, etc.  Reading the whole book was an arduous task for me.  Like his other books, Sacks here describes individuals with various pathologies regarding the way their minds respond to music.  But the case studies were less interesting than those in his other books.  But, I guess there was no other way to write a book like this.  So, in many ways, it was educational.

It appears the author liked end of the world books and after reading a few and watching the Walking Dead  he thought,  ""Hey, I can do that.""  Well, no. Writing a novel take skill and the ability to tell an interesting story.  First person point of view wears very quickly.  Authors must learn patience, how to introduce ideas, the right level of detail, keeping the reader's attention and characters who are not caricatures.  Most of all they must learn to let the story tell itself instead of force feeding the reader every minute  shard.

What's missing is any sense of nuance.  Jack and his kids are perfect, almost able to leap buildings with a single bound. And that mind-numbing detail!!!  It illustrates my point that there is no real story other than survival and fighting zombies.  The best such stories actually have a plot with character who develop and do things - The Stand, The Road, Lucifer's Hammer, the Last Ship (the 1988 novel), On The Beach, etc  There is no way to mask that the detail attempts to hide the lack of any real plot.  It's the standard ""special forces"" guy protecting family from bad guys - humand and inhuman. I found myself skipping whole sections of detail.",0,"[0.5407637675974666, 1.0426133304451697, -0.004204465684451986, -1.0391533817904475, -1.7046250906601292]",1.0426133304451697

In author Cassia Brightmore's, ""Malevolent"", without several somewhat graphic sex scenes this novel may only be about 80 pages long. I'm giving Brightmore's ""Malevolent"" yarn three stars out of a possible five stars.

In some cases too fast is a good thing- here it's not. Without much ""meat on the bone"", there isn't much of a story to read. The maddening thing is, there is a good book in there but it's totally disjointed. I'm curious if author actually did any research on what a sheriff or an FRI Special Agent actually does. Needless to say I'm more than likely not going back for the next book in this ""Darkness"" series. But hey it was a stab in the dark to read something from an author I'd never heard of before.

After finishing this book I ended up doing some research on this author and I can see that her writing tends towards the more quirky side but this was just too over the top for me.  The story had a lot of promise and I really enjoyed Reese and Paisley's characters but all of the insanity with Bellini and the odd behavior of Paisley left me cold on this one.  The chapters from Bellini's point of view were totally unnecessary and redundant.  By half way through the book I completely skipped over her chapters and still didn't lose any of the story.  I get that the author was going for a play on the stuck up reality star princesses of today and taking that to the furthest degree to show the ridiculousness of it all but this was just too far a stretch.  No way that someone did not deck that chick at some point in this book.  Paisley flicking Reese and then HEAD BUTTING him???  Huh?!?!  What the heck?  I really liked Reese's character the best but even some of his dialog was a little crass for me and didn't seem to match with his personality.  The chemistry between these two was good and there were some well written sex scenes but otherwise this book was just a bit too heavy on the awkward side and not enough on the romance side.

To say I loved this book would be an understatement. I have been in a book funk for weeks but this book helped me over that. I could not put it down. I finally handed my Kindle over to my husband at 1 am and told him to take it from me so I could get some sleep but it was the first thing I went for when I woke up. I had to see what Harrison and Hanna were up to!

Hanna is the little sister of Harrisons best friendso yeah, off limits. Whats Harrison supposed to do when he finds her constantly in his thoughts? Avoid, avoid, avoid thats what! But as luck would have it, hes stuck working with her for the time being. Can he keep his hands off her or will she tempt him over the edge? You have to read this book to find out!

I love forbidden romances. Throw in a cocky, sexy man and Im hooked but it was more than Harrison that made me love this book. I loved all the characters. I loved how Hanna was a sweet little temptress. She knew what she wanted and went after it. Boy did she go after it. Then theres Ethan (Hannas brother, Harrisons best friend) and his wife Michelle. Michelle was feisty and just awesome. Even though I loved Ethan, I wanted to punch him but I get why he did what he did but dude, listen to your wife! I love that there was more to Harrison than meets the eye and when Hanna discovered secret parts to him, she wanted him even more. Who wouldnt!

Sadly this was the first book Ive read from this author but it won't be the last. Ive been one clicking her other books. I love her writing style, its fun and fast paced. Its been a nice change from what Ive been reading. I love getting dual POVs. Being in Harrisons head was great. I just want to wrap my arms around him and Hanna was just lovable and adorable.

I chose the brown color. The wallet is  made from very thin material and , yes, there is a crinkling sound when the wallet is opened and closed or the bill separator flap is moved. I don't see this to be an issue and just people nit-picking. I've only had the wallet a day or so and it is holding my stuff firmly in place and I don't see anything that would indicate the wallet is fraying or coming apart..., yet.
Now, this wallet is definitely overpriced by about $10-$12 dollars in my estimation. It does feel cheap and I guess the RFID blocking works. I have no easy way to check. I did receive an email asking me to give the wallet a 5 star review for reasons I find unworthy and objectionable.
This is not a 5 star wallet if all factors are considered. I 've had expensive wallets from Italy and this is not in the same class. My review is taking into consideration the price, workmanship and what it is supposed to accomplish with RFID blocking.
In conclusion, the material is thin and the wallet feels cheap and the price is high. On the other hand, I think t was the best pick from the Amazon RFID wallets. I don't expect this wallet to last more than one year at the high end.

I couldn't find it locally, so finally ordered one on Amazon.

Now, I LOVE carbonated drinks. I've never bought a Soda Stream though, because there's no place around here to get canister refills, and most of the syrups were disgusting, so no point.  I've been drinking sodas, but want to wean myself off the cola type drinks. I thought this might be a good compromise, as I don't really like plain water.

I bought two brands to try - the other one (not naming it here, since this is a review about LaCroix, but it was strawberry dragonfruit. It was gross, and I love dragonfruit) was NOT good at all, so I almost didn't want to try this one!  That would have been a mistake.
This comes very close to Sierra Mist, IMHO.  Of course, it isn't the same, since there is no sweetener in it. That's right - no sugar, so salt, no fake coloring.  Clear and bubbly.  It was very good.  The colder, the better. I tried it right from the case and it was meh.  But, stuck a few cans in the fridge and let them get nice and cold (I don't always have access to ice), and it improved it a great deal.

I can see this being a regular part of my drink lineup.  It will help me not drink so many sugary sodas, but still give me the carbonation I love.
The light lime taste is nice, and I am a big fan.  You could float lime slices in it if you wanted it more pronounced.

1809,"REVIEW OF: THROUGH THE EYES OF A LION: FACING IMPOSSIBLE PAIN, FINDING INCREDIBLE POWER

I'd like to thank Amazon for the opportunity to review this  miraculous book that I received as a complimentary sample.

Pastor Levi Lusko has written a truly remarkable book that is very simple and beautiful in its honesty. He and his wife experienced the horrific pain of the sudden unexpected death of their beloved daughter.

We readers can be very grateful to Pastor Levi for giving us the strength and courage to go beyond our grief, no matter  the personal circumstances that brought us to this place.

In his healing, soothing words,  Pastor Levi teaches us a helpful way to allow our grief to strengthen our ability to face the many challenges of life. The book is written plainly and kindly.  The reader will no doubt appreciate the organization of this book into discrete chapters that focus on a specific theme (e.g. ""Pain is a Microphone"", ""Run Towards the Roar"").  Throughout the book,
one finds hope and inspiration and helpful ideas that enable us to find solutions to our problems.

As unique as we all are, we do share many things in common.  Most people do have it within themselves to meet challenges as they come. But clearly, sometimes it can be overwhelming and we might not see so clearly.  Pastor Levi becomes both teacher and guide and empowers us as we learn from his experiences.

Through The Eyes Of A Lion may be helpful reading for someone you know well who is confronting obstacles in their life. Certainly, it is inspirational and helpful on many levels.

This is a remarkable book. The lessons and insights contained within stay with you. You may reach for this book time and again.",4,"[-2.766625447458601, -2.5965081503329284, -1.6907068244780552, -1.0644336891695443, 0.9933776357825241]",0.9933776357825241

They had a lot to overcome because Jase and Sam's brother Sawyer (aka Sexy Sawyer and oh I love him) but I really loved how the author ended their book.

7384,"I bought this CD for 3 bucks at a used CD shop.  I wanted to get into Dream Theater because I'm a tremendous prog rock fan.  I ended up being deeply disappointed in this CD/album.

More often than not, Dream Theater sounds like they simply borrow bits from all the other prog rock bands out there, and try to mesh into their own style, but it doesn't work at all, at least not on this CD/album.  I recognise the influences here.  When I'm listening to the album, I can hear Metallica, Rush, ELP, Yes, Pink Floyd, and even Ravi Shankar/Indian influences.  But, unfortunately, the influences don't really mess.  They're all over the place without becoming cohesive, and the album doesn't work at all.  The musicianship is generally very good, but it feels cold and mechanical.  The lyrics are tremendously pedestrian and borderline stupid.  The lead vocalist is desperately trying to bring emotion to the awful lyrics, and he ends up making them worse.  There is one tremendous song that I have played over and over again, and that's Beyond this Life.  Even though the lyrics and singing aren't very good, the music on that one track is fantastic.  But the other tracks don't stay with me.  Hopefully, there's better Dream Theater stuff out there.",1,"[0.9804247396241839, 0.989633200381892, -0.5182877480297874, -1.0220213691707658, -1.2984274049329074]",0.989633200381892

Steinhauer tries an oddball slicing of the plot by character and time to make it work, but it just doesn't.  This story has that 1980's anti-hero vibe, with literally no good characters.  My mom described some books as ""you keep going thinking, one more chapter and maybe it will get better, but it never does.""  This is one of them.

This is my second Steinhauer book, and probably my last.  I did another book a few years ago and thought ""Meh"".  Unfortunately I've been short on authors lately and decided to try one more hoping he'd developed more to my taste.  Nope.

Steinhauer has a good writing style and a nice flowing form.  His problems are plot related and character development related.

""Year zero"" is not an adventure nor a thriller, but more like a philosophical text about a world that was devastated by an ancient plague and the effort by those who were spared to quickly find a cure. Although Long's writing style is not bad, his plot and his characters are dull and boring. After the first 100 pages, which are indeed very interesting and set a premise that could be much more well developed, it's all downhill.
There are many books dealing on apocalypse-like and dead-end-for-humanity situations and many of them are better than ""Year zero"": ""The stand"", ""On the beach"" are just two of them.
If the editors had not wanted to create an adventure-like atmosphere to this book, maybe I would have set my mind on a different frame-reading, and then I could have enjoyed it much more. As it is, I didn't.

979,"The Paying Guests is a novel that was the choice for my book club, or I am not sure I would have ever picked it up. My reaction to it is an odd one. The novel held my attention, but for the first 200 or so pages I could not tell you why, as I did not find it particularly interesting. Once the main event of the book happens the story barrels along to its conclusion, but overall the text is overwritten and massively redundant.
The authors characterization of Frances (the protagonist) is probably the most successful thing about the book, and Sarah Waters does a decent job of creating a sense of time and place. Although 1922 London does not leap off the pages of this text, it is clearly established.
The Paying Guests held my attention for stretches at a time, I guess thats a good thing. However, I suspect that this was partly due to the fact that I wanted to move on and read something else.

9665,"32 ounce Deer/Rabbit Repellent

I use this at my cabin which is in the woods with lots of deer & rabbits.  My hydrangeas have never gotten beyond 3 feet tall until I started using a deer/rabbit repellent.  The deer always browsed the new growth so the plants looked healthy but no flowers.  Since this is a vacation house, I'm not there to chase off the deer.  We have security cameras so I've seen the footage of the deer going to the bushes & walking away.  I used to have footage of the deer enjoying my bushes.

It is rain ""resistant"" & it did last through a couple rain storms in the two weeks after I applied it  although it had definitely washed off some of it.  I reapplied it just to be sure.  The 30-day claim is perhaps a bit optimistic unless there has been very little or no rain.  You also need to reapply to any new growth because it will not have the nasty flavor on it to deter the deer/rabbits from snacking.

It does have an odor until it dries but it is less noticeable than similar products I've used.  It's not very offensive; just a cinnamon/clove scent with the rotten eggs/vinegar.

This is an expensive option for deer repellant.  I really don't think it should cost this much considering  the ingredients are not unusual.  Using this with a hose is also kind of messy & maybe more wasteful than other products that don't require a hose.  I think the ""concentrate"" form would be a better choice.  However, if you use the concentrate, you need to run fresh water through the sprayer after using it or you will get clogs from the ""rain resistant"" ingredients.  So both versions have their problems.",2,"[0.9598739405783276, -0.6237550947506094, -1.0659621566471638, -1.0170401642248468, -0.7001796693151805]",0.9598739405783276

246,"""I Suck at Girls"" irritated me some, and I am not all that sure why. The book just did not do all that much for me, and although it is a quick and easy read, I was ready for it to be done. A 180 page book of humor should not make the reader feel that way.
Justin Halpern's tales of romance and sex don't have the ring of truth to them that so many of his stories in his first book, ""S*@! My Dad Says"", seemed to have. I put the book down wondering just how much of it was made up. I also could not shake my suspicions that Justin is a dope, and I get that this is one of his points. However, I did not feel like he was a dope that you would root for.
The most entertaining and worthwhile parts of the text are the moments where Justin's father takes center stage, and there were far too few of them for me to thoroughly engage in the book. Perhaps this premise has now been stretched too thin for the material that exists and Mr. Halpern needs to try something else. I don't know.
For what it is ""I Suck at Girls"" is an okay read. I was just expecting more. Halpern's observations about romance, love, bad sex, etc. have nothing new or interesting to say, and I guess I was hoping that they would.
I don't regret reading this book, but I am also glad that it only consumed a couple of hours of my time.

When the book starts, they are already in a relationship. There aren't even any flashbacks. They really don't even interact with each other or have any conversation. I think it's ridiculous that Hayden has  black card, while owning two restaurants, one of which is a biker bar. The sex wasn't as hot like in most JS books.

Too many people aimles run straight to Hell, avoiding the gracious offer of grace, by simply not thinking about it. Jesus came to earth claiming to be God. He and His apostles claimed that he died in order to take God's wrath stored up for us all. He claimed that if anybody would give up all hope except hope in His death for salvation from our sins, they would be saved and if He was rejected, they would be left to face God's justice in an eternity in Hell. You have to embrace Him and His claims or reject them. Indifference and moral living does not count for anything. For a Christian read this book.

9980,"OMG, talk about difficulty in getting this out of the package!  It took me maybe 5 minutes to do so, then I had to get a Phillips screwdriver to put in SIX batteries, then it had to charge.  If you are getting this as a gift, I suggest you do the above steps ahead of time, or your daughter will be waiting interminably to play with this.  Supposedly it charges for about 30-35 minutes, and there is a light that turns green on the base.  Mine never turned green.  So I tried it, anyway.  The fairy doesn't charge by simply resting on the metal pin, which would have made sense to me.  There is a wire pigtail that hooks onto her.  When you are ready to play, you have to take the pigtail off, and turn her on.  The button is small and hard to find on her skirt.  So she took off.  If you go to the website, you see girls controlling her by putting their hands under her and she rises.  When I did it, she took off toward the lamp and died.

9316,"I found this DVD is the used bin when shopping the other day, and literally for pennies (ok $3), I couldn't believe my good fortune. I immediately snapped this up of course. I hadn't seen ""Live at Pompeii"" in many, many years. I didn't even know that a new ""Director's Cut"" had been released, so I was quite intruiged by this.

""Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii"" (171 min.) starts off with the ""Director's Cut"" (91 min; in 16:9 widescreen). I was a little surprised to see all the additional space footage, I mean how weird is it to see International Space Station footage from (I'm guessing) the 1990s in a concert film that was filmed in late 71/early 72! I also couldn't quite understand the logic behind adding footage (not concert footage, even) from the band messing around at Abbey Studios on various ""Dark Side of the Moon"" material. All rather strange. The original film (60 min; in 4:3 full screen) is also included, thankfully. While I prefer watching the widescreen ""refit"", the original shorter movie makes a lot more sense musically and thematically. ""Echoes Part I"" and ""Echoes Part II"" bookend the fantastic Pompeii-filmed set.

Am I the only one to think that as it relates to the Pompeii-filmed footage, Nick Mason had an inordinate amount of screen time? I'm thinking as much as the other three combined. You can't as much as catch a glimpse of Roger Waters until well into ""Echoes Part I"" for some reason. The DVD contains a 15-20 min. interview with the director Adrian Maben, and it's interesting hearing him talk about the intent of making this the ""anti-Woodstock"" film, with no spectators instead of the ""million"" at Woodstock. In the end, contrary to some other reviewers here, I don't mind all that much that Maben made a ""Director's Cut"", since thankfully the DVD presents both the old and the new versions. In all, a must-have for any Pink Floyd fan!",3,"[0.5624167502814554, 0.9112708447328748, -0.3251571890657068, -1.018119827763268, -1.6617719702817124]",0.9112708447328748

1184,"I have mixed feelings about ""The Sex Lives of Cannibals"" because I alternated between many opinions about this text as I was reading it. It had been on my ""too read"" list for years, and now having read it I am not sure it deserved its spot.
The first 50 pages or so of this book are irritating beyond belief because the author, J. Maarten Troost, has a pedantic and pseudo intellectual vibe going that comes across as the writer being smarmy and cute. It does not endear him to his reader, and that is a problem. However, by chapter seven I was use to his voice and got over my distaste.
""The Sex Lives of Cannibals"" is heavily labeled as a humorous book, and it is funny. More of a smirk and occasional chuckle funny than laugh out loud funny, but Mr. Troost is witty and he employs his wit and sarcasm to nice effect in this travelogue.
I think some of the reviews have been unfair of Troost when they say he is unlikable. Indeed he is at times, especially in the last 25 pages of the book, but his being likable is not a necessary condition for a good read. Some readers have also complained that it was not as anthropological as they had hoped. Mr. Troost is not Tony Horwitz and other writers of that ilk, and to expect him to be is unfair.
I enjoyed this book while reading it (with the exception of the above qualms) but I finished it about four days ago and I am having trouble remembering specifics about the text. I guess that says a lot. I will also note that Mr. Troost's two other books of travel will not jump onto my reading list.

This book was breathtaking and beautiful. There wasn't a moment that didn't have me crying my eyes out. Its stories like these that make me love to read. It was an emotional roller coaster from beginning to end and I was left with a massive book hangover to last me a week.

Carrigan Ace Casper was the girl I wish Id known in High School. And Heath Lovelly, was the boy I had a massive crush on. The world works in mysterious ways, and through loss two souls meet and they're lives intertwine. Heath and Ace become the best of friends, after that mournful day in a hospital 10 years ago. Theyre feelings for one another began to change and soon friendship turns into love. But life isn't always rainbows and butterflies. Life challenges you and throws you curve-balls.

Ace must face the hardest challenge of all and she must lie to Heath to protect him, but what Ace doesn't realize is that Heath knows her better than anyone ever could and that she isn't alone. And together they conquer the uncertainties and the struggle.

'Forever Kinda Love' was a story that makes you believe in soul mates and in true love. I truly had a great time reading it and its official, Heath has become one of my many Book Husbands, along with Rock, Vincent, and Harrington :D. I also how can you not love the secondary characters.

1534,"Trouble in Mudbug was a very entertaining lite mystery with a touch of the paranormal and a little romance.  The main mystery was interesting and may keep you guessing until the big reveal.  There were also suprising revelations, and numerous twist and turns.  The paranormal angle was unique and I laughted until I literally cried during a couple of scenes involving said ghost.  The book DOES contain one sex scene but IMO it's not overly or particularly graphic.  I found it astounding that one reviewer stated that there ""were too many sex scenes"" and another reviewer implied that the sex scene was gratuitous and extremely graphic.  Both reviews had me wondering what book they read because it couldn't have been this one.  One of the same reviewers then stated that she is not a ""prude.""  However, IMO only the latter could say that this book had ""too many"" sex scenes when there was only one in the entire book.  And anyone who considers that scene overly graphic or gratuitous has most certainly never, most certainly should never and most certainly would never read anything in the erotica/erotic genre.  LOL

Based on some of the reviews, apparently there are some grammatical errors but quite frankly I didn't notice them.  I was too busy enjoy the story.  Yes, some of the characters are a little one dimensional but I still liked them.  Futhermore,  one reviewer stated that Maryse's researching a cure for cancer wasn't feasible well if I not mistaken aren't major companies currently spending millions on research for the same thing.  Come on people lighten up stop over- analyzing and let others enjoy this delightful book.  Sheesh!!

That's how I felt with Rome & Molly....blown away with emotions. I loved every minute, every page & was lost in their story for hours. Beautiful. Heartbreaking. Amazing.
I'm so anxious to read book 2 which is in Rome's POV! I love these characters so much I'm thankful to experience more of them!

I'm a big fan of Tillie Cole now...an author that can hook me from page 1, get the tears flowing & my heart pumping...is ACE in my book!!

9692,"I have been buying these lamps for 7 or 8 years.  I had an adult male iguana (has sadly since passed away of old age) and I have a Russian tortoise, and I was using these lamps for both.  I would even sometimes use these bulbs when I had a sick bird that needed a bit of extra warmth.  (I had an additional UV source for the iguana; was using this one primarily for the heat.)

For years, these were great.  They would last me a long enough time that I would forget how old they were.  I would hardly ever have to buy replacements, and they provided an appropriate amount of heat for the locations in which I placed them.

And then, about a year ago, something happened.  They started burning out in less than a month.  Several of them only lasted 2 weeks.  I even tried replacing the fixtures they were in.  I used both the metal reflective types and the fixtures that are white on the inside and black on the outside.  Brand new or old, it wasn't the fixtures -- the bulbs just kept going out.

I was buying them at a physical store and inspecting them before use and nothing LOOKED out of the ordinary.  The boxes they came in were in good shape.  So it wasn't a problem with shipping, but instead with materials and/or manufacturing.

Anyway, 2 stars because they were good at one time.  Perhaps they'll fix whatever is wrong in their manufacturing process and become good again.  In the meantime, if you are looking for a replacement item, the PetSmart store brand ones have lasted me for at least 4-5 months so far and are still working as I type this.",1,"[0.8866718971377643, 0.24331910606306195, -0.4298453846691097, -1.0154264353057765, -1.2057505970335238]",0.8866718971377643

1751,"The first Holly Bush novel I ever read was ROMANCING OLIVE.  I liked it a lot.  That led me to a few others that I didn't like all that much.  This Train Station story was being offered at a bargain price so I thought to give Bush books another shot. Well, now I know.  Holly Bush and I aren't a good fit.  It seems that OLIVE was the only exception.

This book has good bones.  The story, unfortunately underdeveloped, could have been excellent, perhaps if written with a lighter touch and a tad more care and talent.  Instead almost everyone here was an exaggerated caricature and the story was predictable and exasperating.  For example, how unkind and mean-spirited can one family be?  Based on the Crawford family here, the answer is limitless unkindness and meanness.  And how stupid and spineless can one heroine be?  Based on Julia here, the answer is limitless spinelessness and stupidity.

The hero was 90% OK except for his one big moment of failure.  The mistaken identity and subsequent wrong couples paired at the beginning was not used to any advantage, the city girl acclimating to country life was underdeveloped, and, frankly speaking, I didn't like anyone in the Crawford family, including the heroine.  The hero deserved someone with more sense and more spine.

In summary, this was a disappointing read.  Not well developed, with exasperating behavior of some characters, repetition of events that kept the story from flowing nicely, and with an unpolished writing style that did not appeal to me.",1,"[0.8817704554071892, 0.5979905804927079, -0.3035893046716962, -1.0450306084977063, -1.6655646566164632]",0.8817704554071892

854,"My 11-year-old and 13-year-old granddaughters both recommended this book, and since I expect them to read the books I suggest to them, I always read the books they recommend to me. The cover is outstandingly full of promise for a creepy read, featuring an old-fashioned black and white photo of a little girl apparently levitating. Unfortunately, the book never does deliver.

The expected thrills and chills never really materialize. Sure there's a kind of monster who makes two brief appearances, and we have a chase through a bog, but it's never very exciting or suspenseful. In addition, I felt that the author never really pinpoints one target audience. The central character is a teenager, and a teen romance is included, but otherwise the book reads as if it is written for the tween set, more in line with the Goosebumps series.

This is a book with a gimmick -- the text is interspersed with vintage photos picturing the supposed characters. The photos are truly fascinating, but it often seems that characters are inserted into the plot just because the author happened to find a quirky photo.

Still, my granddaughters liked it so perhaps I am too harsh in my judgments or reviewing the book from too adult a viewpoint.

I didn't think it was possible to create such a world in a story that takes place in an average city in an average time. But, she did. Now, there were no dragons in this story, but there was plenty of magic and plenty of the fun and imagination that I really enjoy in Donita's stories.

I was pulled into this story very quickly because I liked Cora right from the start. She is a very nice and likable character. She is a character that I felt an instant connection with and one that I felt deserved happiness - and deserved to go to a magical ball. It also didn't take long for me to like Simon, and of course, his sister Sandy stole the show many times.

I would say the only part of the book that I didn't love was the end. It was the happy ending I was hoping for, but the book just sort of ended and it felt a little flat.

This is Alyssa Hampstead and cousins, Shane Connor and Sebastian De Loren's story. It is full of intense love, a beautiful mnage, incredible heartbreak and immeasurable sadness. A THOROUGHLY satisfying story that deserves a second read, it was that good.

I always look forward to reading ANYTHING written by this fabulous author!

There is no plot, there is a big case of insta-lust (which is fine) which then, FOR NO REASON that is explained, turns into insta-love on the part of the hero within a matter of days.

Lots of sex -not something I object to when it moves the plot forward -- and not much else.  Also, the dialogue is truly uninteresting and UNwitty.

9335,"A lot of people say this movie was slow and the story line was weak. Most thought the end wasn't as shattering as other movies by Shyamalan. When I saw the trailer of this movie , I thought to myself now thats one movie I wouldn't like to watch.

Twenty minutes into the movie I'm trying to figure out the who's who and the what's what. There are some great scenes in the film that made me want to capture it for a while. I was quite moved by the scene on the porche. Now that was an excellent scene. I felt to myself ""Hell wait a minute...isnt this supposed to be a Horror Flick?"" There's some great emotion that wilfully shows on screen. The elders in the movie and how they were portrayed was as per quite ""unworldly"" owing to the fact it requires complete abandonment of the normal social norms that exist.

I felt I was lost somewhere in the middle of the movie. I mean the total  plot seemed kind of confusing to me. The haunting violins that add to the super stunning visuals only left me more guessing than I thought I would be. Noah's (Adrien Brody) character was very interesting and befitting.

I won't ruin the end for the fortunate people who haven't seen the movie. Fortunate because they have a great movie to look forward to. Once the movie ended , I couldn't help but carry a 10 minute grin on my face. It managed to have that affect on me.

Now I know this movie is not for anyone. Its not your regular scare you to death movie. However its different with its limited yet quite enrapturing.

This cd far surpasses the first, which I loved, in song selection, vocal performance and interpretation and Carrie proves herself a true unique talent with her own special gifts.

I can put this cd in my player and let it run over and over for there is no filler here for me.  But there are certainly some highlights.  ALL AMERICAN GIRL allows Carrie to hit some notes never heard before.  Her interpretation of I TOLD YOU SO is heartfelt and very much her own.  But it is the standout I KNOW YOU WON'T a weepy ballad that Carrie turns into raw emotion that will stun you.  She holds notes forever and puts all her range and capabilities into it.  I find this song as much a classic as Linda Ronstadt doing DESPERADO.  Of course the uptempo FLAT ON THE FLOOR and LAST NAME are awesome.

I am thrilled with how openly Carrie Underwood has been accapted into the country music community for she is what the genre stands for.  A true country girl with talent, charm and unique gifts with a very honest, positive message.  Her career is laid out for her.  She is one of the rare finds of this decade.

It's probably a testament to Black's writing that she kept me interested and curious for so long. It wasn't until probably 45-50% of the way that I partially tempted to stop reading, but I continued because I was invested enough to see how it would all end and play out. Luckily, it paid off for the most part at the end. I really liked that twist and there's one amazingly brutal scene before that where I was pretty enraptured with the book.

Jude, oh, Jude. Man, I hated this girl so many times. I just couldn't get on board with her views of Fairie and the Folk. I guess, personally, I would've been more like Vivienne, defiant and unsatisfied with the life they were living. I get making the best of your circumstances, but when she had thoughts of not only being like them, of being better, I just couldn't. Don't even get me started on her weak sister and the drama there. In the end, she did manage a sliver of respect from me, and she does have the potential to become a strong heroine, but for now, I indifferent to her.

I'll say that this wasn't the ""epic"" story I was hoping for going in, it's still not bad. I definitely curious and liked it enough that I'll check out the next book.

You will meet Lily's Guardian Angel, Max

Lily's story is my story.... just insert my name. (even losing my baby)  That is why I was so angry with Lily.

1337,"Wow. That this has a retail price of $18 is UNCONSCIONABLE. Even at Amazon's discount of about $10, it is a rip-off.  Ms. Harris says in the introduction that many fans were clamoring to know what happened to many characters not mentioned in the last book, and what happens in the future for those characters that did get mentioned. This book is supposed to serve as an epilogue of sorts to the series with that information. I expected a short book since this isn't a full story. However, this does not even qualify as a book.

This small book is just about 7 inches tall by 5 inches wide.  And each page has one character (or couple) and their ""epilogue,"" or a full page illustration which includes a stylized letter of the alphabet at each section to sort the characters by name. Only the epilogues amount to just a couple of sentences centered on a mostly blank page. In fact, John Quinn on page 138 actually says ""JOHN QUINN had many more adventures."" That's it! AN ENTIRE PAGE FOR ONE SINGLE SENTENCE!!

I am extremely disappointed that Charlaine Harris put her name on this.  If she wanted to give a little peek into the future for fans, this should have been an e-book for 99 cents - or better yet, free on her website. Instead, she let her publisher gouge fans for even more money for something that takes 10 minutes at most to read and probably took about that long to write. What a slap in the face to fans who stuck with her through the end.

I really did want to read this book because it took place in Colorado. In fact, in Aspen, Colorado. A real place that is only a few hours away from where I live. So because this story did reference to real places, it helped with the geographical location aspect of the story and made it seem as if this could be a real story. Which it actually could be with the subject matter. I don't want to say too much as I don't want to give anything away.

Both Dani and Ty are great in this book. It is just that the rest of the characters do not live up to the same standard and therefore the story was a little lackluster.

It's also clean in the sense that the earthy language one would expect is not present and instead ""son of a biscuit"" is used. It also portrays a young Christian woman willing to follow God's will to help Afghanis. However, I found it very difficult to follow, despite the listing at the beginning, because many characters had up to five names used to refer to them (first name, last name, nick name, rank, and sometimes nationality or culture). It was impossible to learn who was who and the problem could have been easily avoided. Also sometimes the references would come out of nowhere, for example when mention was made of an ""escort"" and later a character spoke. Was that character the escort? A good editing could have taken care of these issues, which kept interrupting the flow and derailed me over and over.

9491,"Several weeks elapsed between my viewing of Atlas Shrugged I and this second installment. When the DVD started, and I didn't recognize any of the actors, I stopped the DVD and looked it up on-line to be sure that I had received the correct DVD. I suppose there was a good reason for changing actors for all of the primary roles in the middle of the story, but I can't imagine what it was. It was very disconcerting, to say the least. Once I picked up the story line again, I waited to be swept up into the world of Ayn Rand, but I found the characters to be wooden and the dialogue to be pretentious and awkward. The Rearden and D'anconia actors were okay in their roles, but the new Dagney Taggart lacked the gravitas and presence of the original.

The line ""Who is John Galt"" was heard much more often, but with little explanation or clue as to the answer... The heavy-handed government bureaucrats, seizing the means of production and limiting the output of factories, are universally unlikeable (Rand would like this portrayal.) The special effects, particularly the flying scene, were definitely low budget. Though the film was probably fairly representative of the plot in Rand's book, I don't think the author would have been particularly pleased with this rendition. Nevertheless, I will probably view the third installment when it finally arrives, just to see if the screen writers are able to wrap this up effectively and maintain the integrity of Ayn Rand's dystopian view of society.",2,"[0.4236263880865163, 0.8271852575799863, 0.1850333189266209, -1.0348616343670292, -2.212859802594631]",0.8271852575799863

632,"I read an exciting novel, set in A.D. 2088, and titled ""The Last Christian"", written by David Gregory. The author wrote a best selling novel ""Dinner With a Perfect Stranger"".
The United States, in this work of fiction, has abandoned the Christian religion, and the world is on the brink of disaster. A scientist has decided to kill a billion people to push the survivors in to adopting his invention. The heroine is Abby Caldwell, who was raised by her parents in a remote village in the South Pacific. Abby is a devoted Christian who travels to the United States and experiences culture shock.
Abby inadvertently breaks the Tolerance Act of 2036, when she spoke critically about other religions on a news show, and she faces being arrested for that. This act reminds me of recent actual laws which ban hate speech, in the USA, Europe and in Australia and in many Muslim countries.
Sometimes fiction, even science fiction, is eerily predictive of what could happen.
Gregory has crafted a fast paced, well written thriller.

In the case of this book, I wish I could say the same.
It wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't what I hoped it would be.
It left me feeling confused, and rather empty, hollow. It didn't quite fulfill my expectations of good story telling and the romance wasn't as passionate as it was applied in the books blurb.

If I had to choose one word to describe this book it would be - depressing. I felt it lacked direction and purpose and despite its fast pace it fell short of the mark: to grab my attention and keep me interested in the world portrayed.

Sometimes when you read a series the books that come after the first one are not always as amazing as the first one that you fell in love with but not with this series that's for sure. Phew, where to begin with this book. This book was angsty that's for sure. It had me on the edge of my seat the whole time and I couldn't wait to turn the page to see what would happen next. It broke my heart, shreddred it into a million pieces, broke it again and then slowly , very slowly started to put it back together. I still loved the characters as much as I did in the first book. In relationships sometimes there is a period where it has to hurt to get better and this book definitely made you feel that.

That's actually normal for any book released by a noted conservative author. As soon as it comes out, the liberal ""spin machine"" goes into action and denigrates it, hoping that the reading public is too stupid to see the political agenda behind the negativity. Luckily, there is still a large segment of American society that likes to make up its own mind, and doesn't need the poohbahs at [...] and such to tell it what is good to read, and what is not. Left up to themselves, these upholders of ""liberal"" values would stage mass book-burnings, as we saw in the '30s and '40s in Europe.

And what about the General Betray us ad? It's venal and patently untrue, but where was the big outcry by the ""freedom of speech"" crowd against it? A strange silence.

Their story is so sad yet so romantic..Its about tragedy and how a person copes with it. But its also about love and hope and how a single person can change you from the inside out..
Its about how a single person can have the power to liberate you from your demons and make you see. Really see everything and everyone..

The story is so moving that it cannot not touch your heart..You cant help but love the characters ..The writing is impeccable, once again.

1457,"Karen Chance was the author that got me into urban fantasy. I saw Touch the Dark, picked it up, loved it, and have been hooked on the genre since. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy Curse the Dawn, and I did not enjoy Midnight's Daughter. Dory is a kick butt Dhampir with family issues. She is not complex, not emotionally deep, and not particularly interesting. To some extent I expect that out of the genre now, but that doesn't mean I like it. I've read deep, realistic, exciting main characters, so I know it's possible. I feel like the author wanted to cram as much action as possible into this book. It's hectic, and it's not just the action, there are also plenty of sub plots and fantasy creatures. Everything was half explained so that the action could continue at it's crazy pace. The main plot is simple, kill Dracula. There are about 20 pages pertaining to just that. Everything else is danger and action. Then there are fey, mutant animals, trolls, and all sorts of other creatures thrown in. Personally, I don't think enough time was spent on anything. If a few of the dangerous encounters were replaced with some plot lengthening this could have been good. I was definitely interested in Dory and Louis-Cesare's pasts, and the animal experiments, as well as the fey and the Dracula family, but there wasn't enough of it. Overall, Midnight's Daughter was decent, and there is potential for some interesting things in the future, but the postscript hints at another butt kicking action packed book, and I need a little more depth than that.",2,"[-0.37897548604931575, 0.7971036202077899, -0.1746237345708781, -1.0288896943845287, -1.8605017877794472]",0.7971036202077899

Tom Hazard has lived for over 500 years, but has he REALLY been living? There's so much pain and sorrow that he's holding on to over the centuries, so much fear that he refuses to let go of.

He's lost the most important people in his life, and he's let himself be seduced by an evil man masquerading as his savior. This story is a look back on the most important moments of his very, very long life, and the realization that there's more to life then just 'staying alive'.

I loved taking this journey with Tom. I was so sorry to have to say goodbye to him when the story was over. This is a book (for me at least) that will stay with you long after you finish it. I have recommended this book to EVERYONE. I absolutely loved it, and plan to re-read it again soon.

I just wanted to reach into the pages and hold Dancer, rock him, and maybe ride him ;) This book touched my heart and had me on a roller coaster of emotions. Dancer has to face his past to get a future. Carrie has to let him deal with his demons and it's so hard to watch the person you love most in life fight so hard. I love how Jordan wrote Dancer's story, how hard he fought, the things he had to do, and see, for him to stand up and fight. I felt for Carrie more than once throughout the book, after everything she has been through, she had to be the tough one, the one to fight for them. For their future. She is an amazing woman and I love the strength that gets, from God knows where. I've never read a story like this, it's not a typical love story, heck I'm not even sure if it's a love story! It's a fighting for your life story, a story of how two people can be so far apart and still know what the other needs. I can't say enough good things about this book. I was blown away, and I am still thinking about it. I loved every single word and I applaud you Jordan Marie, your words poured right into my heart, and I don't think it'll ever be the same.

761,"Words I would use to describe this book:  stunning, beautiful, captivating, heart-wrenching, soul-searching, and magnificentthose are a few to start with.

This book brings forth a tsunami of emotions! I laughed, I cried, and Im still thinking about it! I LOVE books that make me feel the characterstheir pain, their joy, their sadnessand Lisa Kleypas possesses this ability. She rips your heart right out of your chest, shatters it, and then puts it back together again! An emotional roller coaster ride, if Ive ever been on one.

I have to say that Joe Travis is just the most perfect hero youll ever hope to meet.  It takes him no time at all to have Avery Crosslin questioning which end is up? Who can blame her? He IS irresistibleand Averys not very good at resistingbut she won't ever let that happen again! Nope! It will NOT happen EVER!or will it? I don't think she considered meeting a man like Joe Travis when she made that vow.

Lisa Kleypas captivates with this installment in her Travis Family series. The evolution of Joe and Averys relationship makes enduring love believable. The story is poignant and heart wrenching. It is a layered, powerful story of love, hope and redemption - a brilliant and epic family drama  it fills the senses...courtesy of the authors amazing narrative. The characters are complicated, flesh and blood real. You relate to them. You feel their pain, their joy, their sorrow

9333,"15 extra minutes doesn't sound like much, but it really improved this film.  I think the theatrical version didn't do as well because it took a character people were familiar with (from Pitch Black) and expanded it to the nth degree without any background explanation!  What makes a ""Furian"" so special? Where the heck did Necromongers come from! These 15 minutes go a long way to fleshing it out (not to mention the deleted scene with Aereon that should've gone in the director's cut). A new character is included in the footage that gives insight to the Furians and the extras provide a deeper mythos for the Riddick world, making you beg for a sequel.

Critics panned Diesel's performance, but really, was Arnold Schwarzenegger's acting in the Terminator any better?  No.  Diesel acts as well as any other ""action"" star--see this movie for the action and adrenaline, not an oscar performance. Buy it!

One thing: the movie begins with an introduction by the director explaining that when new/expanded scenes appear there will be some disruption to the scene.  I never noticed anything of the sort.

It could still be used if you carefully placed the button in the slot.  It never ground beans properly -especially small (1/2 C beans) batches.  You ended up w/dust to whole beans!  It only did slightly better  on larger batches. I have other family members who also received it as a gift. They didn't have to modify it to make it work but the grinding is very poor/uneven.

He might color outside the lines, but he manages to turn it around and come out on top.  He's a good man.

My need to protect her was overwhelming.  I'd never felt anything like it.  She was sunshine and warmth and fire under my skin.

Elaine's voice grew wistful, 'If you love someone, set him free.' ... 'If he doesn't come back, hunt him down and kill him.'

He kissed me like I was a country to be liberated, and he was he Marine for the job.

I saw you and my soul came to live inside me.

The first time I saw you in Arizona, I knew you were something special.  Only, I thought it would just be a week-long special.

My Review:

This was my first time reading Tia Louise, and I don't know what took me so long  I could kick myself.  It was well-written, emotive, insightful, descriptive, and held my attention beginning to end.  I am an instant fan.  The sensual scenes were volcanically hot and had me gasping to catch my breath.  Written with a melancholy air, this piece was frequently angsty, occasionally humorous, and continually engaging.  I am hooked.  I want to go backward in the series and read them all.

I really don't know how to write this review without giving any important parts of the plot away.  So, I won't tell you anything about the plot except that Keary really knows how to build up the tension and leave you anticipating what happens next.

Alivia is one hell of a strong heroine!!  She is put through so much emotionally, physically and mentally.  Yet she always remains strong.  Ian, yea, well he's Ian.  LOL

We were left with a ton of questions in House of Royals and some of those questions were answered in House of Pawns but now there are even more secrets and questions that need answered.  I love this world that Keary is creating - I feel like I know everything about it yet at the same time, I don't.  I love that feeling - it's what keeps me gripped in the story!

2208,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Skippy Dies, especially the first 2/3 or so.  To Murray's credit, the dialog between the core of students who drive the plot was consistently vulgar, smart, and funny, and many of the relationships between adults rang true, as did their strains. There are some lovely turns of phrase; one in particular deserves notice, in which Murray builds from a summary of string theory to the conclusion that ""the universe is built of loneliness."" I appreciated that Murray tries to make the story more than just a lark; he raises serious issues in the book. Unfortunately, in about 600 pages of text, this book has about 400 pages worth of plot and 1500 pages worth of themes -- social interaction among youth, the differences between boys and girls, theories of pedagogy, the cynicism of school administrators, history and culture of WWI, western and easten thanatology, the manifestations of female beauty in myth, cosmology and topology, etc etc etc. It's too much, and most have to be dealt with quite superficially.

Other issues: though some aspects of campus life ring true in this book (similar anyway to the schools I attended), the students did not seem nearly cliquish enough. Perhaps that's a difference between American and Scottish culture, but with the exception of a couple of sociopaths, too many kids got along too easily. Ruprecht, the genius of the bunch, is bizarrely and unrealistically credulous about certain mystical topics that rise in the plot. And young women are regarded horribly in the book -- materialistic, manipulative, and stupid.",3,"[0.7519308326747569, -0.00028293512617905137, -0.16231425816874967, -1.0113456950406476, -2.316951220480867]",0.7519308326747569

He loves her so unconditionally and won't stop until he gets her back into his life!!! He doesnt heed the warnings thrown his way by Dante even if it meant his life was in danger. He even went as far as assaulting Dante but his reasons were completely justified.

So many truths come out in this book that your mind will be blown. From Andino's manipulation of Catherines fears to Dante's unthinkable deeds. But the clincher is when Catherine finally owns all if her lies and hidden truths. Her family is socked beyond words and after their opinions of Cross change. To me that was one of the best parts of the whole book!!!

But just when you think things are going to be okay BAM and the unthinkable happens. I mean you know that what happened on the gun run that Cross took Catherine on that there is going to be major backlash but Bethany does such a great job of leading you away from that that by the time it happens it quite a surprise. I think my heart stopped at one point and again I was so p****d at Dante. But all ends well and thats what matters.

What Cross does at the end for his proposal is beyond words. I fell completely in love with him all over again!!! Its impossible to not love Cross!!!
Bethany you are amazing!!! There isn't a book that I have read by you that I haven't liked!!! You are by far the best Mafia romance author I have ever read!!!

8259,"This book sounded really great, which is one of the reasons I wanted to read it. Unfortunately, the story was bogged down with choppy dialogue, clunky exposition, and too much plot without enough meaning behind it. While I could have gotten over the dialogue and exposition slowing down the pace, it's hard to forgive the side stories that didn't move the story forward. Example: Michelle learns her old teacher is actually her father. Gets upset, has a dinner with him, and you never really hear about it again. Second example: We see a few chapters told from Elron's perspective, but there is literally no reason for it except to show that he is a grief stricken elf with a crush. For two thirds of the book - right in the middle - we don't even hear from him and have no idea what he's doing. Both of these story lines could have been taken out and put into a sequel without damaging the rest of the story. But, honestly, I think most of the world building problems and clunky writing could have been solved or at least minimized by writing in third person. First person forces odd sentence structure without the providing extra information.

I listened to the audio version of this book and I must say the production value was very good. Jeff Hays did an amazing job with the voices. I couldn't believe that he did all the voices, including the females'. The effects were really good, especially the voices over the phone and the magical creature voice effects. The pacing was pretty good, although the comedic timing was a bit off. However, the audio production earned this book an extra star, as I didn't like the writing that much.

Listen to the audio version!

6248,"After reading the previous book in this series, I really didn't think I'd read this last one because I disliked the character Jack.  This book was about his traveling to 1909 to rescue Amy.  After the fiasco of the previous book and his adventure, I didn't think I could handle an entire book of Jack's selfish personality.  I'm glad I took the chance and read the last book in the series.  This one had some of the great characters I've grown to enjoy throughout the books.  There was suspense, some violence and some romance.  One of the things I've disliked about some of the books is the sappy romance between some of the characters.  ""Get a room already"" is something I found myself saying a number of times while reading.  This book didn't have the sappy parts of a romance, but growing affection.  Yes, there was the instant attraction and spark, but the characters didn't act on it and it was refreshing.

This ended up being one of my favorite time travel series and I was sad to see it end.  At least for now.........",3,"[0.7322257204906282, -0.14964958997938704, -0.04765760901712013, -1.0134165190407705, -2.2327476928810563]",0.7322257204906282

6309,"I'm in love with the West family!! Ford West is my favorite so far. We got a glimpse of him in Unplanned, Lincoln's book, and now we get his full story.

Ford is the middle child and he is a very broken man. He's been through some terrible things and is just making his way thru life without actually living it. He's know as an alcoholic and party animal.

Mackenzie Mueller has heard all about Ford and his ways. She's been through some things herself and thinks Ford is no good for her. After a one-night stand, she runs. When Ford finds her again, he is determined to show her how good for each other they are.

Ford and Mack's story is full force right from page 1. They both go thru so much and together they are so much stronger for it. Mack is the glue that puts Ford back together. Their story is amazing and fun and sexy. So much detail that keeps you hooked. I can't wait for Reagan's story next.",4,"[-4.072193958030102, -3.548823650799346, -1.861501541058772, -1.0441196368965762, 0.7266824252646691]",0.7266824252646691
