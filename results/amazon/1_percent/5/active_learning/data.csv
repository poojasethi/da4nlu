Jack Nicholson is outstanding as the private detective torn between making a living, loyalty and ethics. Faye Dunaway is suitably distressed as a woman condemned by fate and John Huston gives a compelling performance as a despicable man without redeeming virtue. With one question near the conclusion of the movie, the detective shows why the corruption in this case is truly evil.",4,"[-1.835381729897116, -1.3619536321413799, -1.1575721285582041, -1.021492214790454, -0.9124395292592827]",-0.9124395292592827
1691,"Whilst I really liked this book, I didn't love it as I have many others by Marie Force. Don't get me wrong, it's written to her usually high standard, the story stirs your emotions, the towns and cities are beautifully descriptive, the story line is there and it has some good steamy moments, I just didn't fall in love with the characters as I usually do.

To summise the plot, Ted, Smitty, Parker and Chip are in their late thirties, have been friends for over 20 years and are all successful professional men. Smitty has a new girlfriend Caroline, Ted meets her and it's love at first sight...but he can't hurt his best friend or deny his feelings.

There's no denying Ted Duffy is one dishy Doctor; he is a wonderfully kindhearted man who says and does the most perfect things; there were moments where I swooned, but he needed to man up a bit when the story hit its critical points. I warmed to Caroline as the book progressed and she found her strength to fight for her man, I just would have liked there to have been a little more build-up and conversation when they first met.  The secondary characters all bring valuable content and whilst Parker, Smitty and Chip were likeable enough, it was Ted's Grandparents who made it for me. They were wonderful characters and their love for their Grandson was heartwarming.

It is worth reading if you want romance, drama and a bit of steaminess and if you are a fan of Marie Force it's unlikely you'll be disappointed. Despite my minor grumbles it really was a good read.",3,"[-3.554634407213315, -1.5969126737075088, -1.0259499906791008, -0.999400146297154, -0.9125383164897574]",-0.9125383164897574
7605,"There is so much to love about this watch, it tracks miles (laps), pace, distance, heart rate (with chest strap) and can be used for interval training. It seemed the obvious choice after my Polar RC3 conked out after three years. Unfortunately, getting used to the Polar watch, I have a hard time with this watch's lack of features that I liked in my last watch.

For one thing - the display on this watch does not show climb (although you can download your information after completing a run and see it online).

Also, the band is not great for persons like me with very small wrists. I find the thickness of the band makes it hard to put on (and I only wear it when running).

Lastly, the feature I dislike the most (and now even more since I had the chance to try out the Garmin Forerunner 35, which, btw, has an excellent display but a substandard heart rate monitor) is the size of the display for the Lap feature (which shows notifies you, say, as you reach each mile).

In summary, this may be the best value Garmin out there for your average amateur runner, but it could still use a few improvements, especially in the band, display and the climb/altitude.",3,"[-3.245283380493885, -1.0933879005662666, -0.9129045548967162, -1.0161512561203476, -0.9560405424698843]",-0.9129045548967162

A bit of this book seemed like a set up for future books. Just the way we were introduced to some of Wes Braden's staff. And that's okay, it just didn't seem as organic as it usually does.

I loved this book though. I guess it's the avid reader/wannabe librarian in me. I totally understood Callie's love of books and need to find time for her books. I didn't feel as though Wes was given as much depth, but his romantic streak more than made up for it in my eyes.

1797,"What a fabulous book!  Oh my goodness my heart wept for poor Abbie!  Her parents abandoned her, her beloved grandpa who raised her has dementia, she married a louse of a man who left her and now she is facing the very real possibility of being booted from the only home she has ever known and her source of livelihood.  Abbie laughed again, bitterly.  She should have known he wouldnt stay.  No one in her life ever did.  Not her father.  Most certainly not her mother.  Gran had died and left her for heaven.  Debbie had gone off and gotten married to Menard.  Even Gramps lived forty years in the past as a young lighthouse keeper, leaving her stranded alone in 1880.  What a lot to have dealt with by the age of eighteen!
But then a man washes up on the shore of her lighthouse island  Rose Island  and he has no memory but because of an overheard conversation, thinks he is her missing/dead husband.  But will this be a complication or a game changer?

I really loved the unexpected twists and turns the story had  as well as the depictions of the hard lives lighthouse keepers had.  This book is based on a real lighthouse  Rose Island lighthouse in Newport, Rhode Island  and on real stories of lighthouse keepers and the storms they battled.  I also loved how real Abbie seemed  trying so hard to do the right thing, even when it was so hard, and also how she struggles with how to work with her grandpa to keep him from getting agitated.

646,"I loved Stephen King's books when I was in high school.  SALEM'S LOT, THE SHINING and PET SEMATARY are still among my favorite horror stories.  I'd also include THE DEAD ZONE but the movie was and is still the best film ever made of King's books.

But I was always intimidated by the length of THE STAND.  After decades of hearing so many people rave about it, I decided to read it after all these years--and to take on the Complete and Uncut longer edition!

Mr. King does an amazing job of recounting a believable plague that wipes out the United States and the entire world.  It's that frightening and believable scenario that makes the book so good and justifies its length.  (I'm going to go rent the mini-series now and see how they did).

My only problem with the novel is that the characters really don't exhibit as much introspection and change as the world events.  Maybe it's a quibble, but I wondered what the characters would think, feel and do if they accepted the supernatural turns their world goes through.  To me, the survivors stay pretty much the same people throughout the obvious intrusion of God and the Devil in the new world.

But don't get me wrong: THE STAND is a great read.  I can see why King's ""dark little tale of Christianity"" has so many devoted fans.

The local cops have arrested young Tommy Braham for the killing of a local college student found in a lake, in what looks like a crime of passion. Tommy's confessed, but slits his own wrists in his cell, and Dr. Sara Linton, former county medical examiner who is in town to visit her family, suspects that there's more to this story than meets the eye. When Agent Trent arrives, he agrees with Dr. Linton, but the waters are muddied by Linton's grudge against the arresting officer, Detective Lena Adams, whom Linton holds responsible for the death of her husband, the former police chief. When the first victim's boyfriend is also found dead, in much the same manner, it becomes clear that Tommy Braham was indeed innocent. What follows are two tension filled days of grueling investigation, during which each of the major characters must confront his/her own weaknesses.

Once the story got moving and Krista's attitude started to come around, I really enjoyed this book.

Although my mom did not have Alzheimer's and we did not have a strained relationship, she was my best friend, I connected with these characters and their story because of the strong bond that exists between mother and daughter.

Second, they can apparantly do things like walk around on 2 feet and carry plates, drive cars, open windows, etc. And yet, they also get mistaken for stray dogs, so I'm guessing they also walk around on all fours. I had a bit of a hard time getting a good visual picture of them in my head, but the picture I did get reminded me somewhat of that 1985 Michael J. Fox movie ""Teen Wolf"". If you've seen it, you'll know what I mean. And that is kind of the overall feel I got from the book. It's cute and a little corny, but not in a bad way.

Luc gets called away suddenly and Tasha is mistakenly arrested and thrown into a Bahamian jail for 48 hours before she is released, never knowing what happened to Luc. Fast forward 7 years after that ill fated encounter and they meet again when Luc happens to be the long lost brother of Tasha's best friend's fiance.

He is now in Razor Bay trying to connect with brothers he never knew he had and longs for that family closeness. They are both very surprised to see each other again.

Most of his books are staggeringly well-written; sometimes, he doesn't quite hit the mark, which I felt was the case with his last two books, Man in the Dark and Invisible. His latest novel, Sunset Park, shows he's back in fine form, as it both tugs at your heart and makes you think.

Miles Heller is fairly directionless. Seven years ago he dropped out of college and stepped out of his parents' lives; since then, he has drifted around the country without any real plans. While living in Florida and working on a crew that empties foreclosed homes, he meets Pilar, a wise-beyond-her-years high school senior, and the two fall in love. Running afoul of Pilar's older sister, Miles flees back to his native New York until Pilar's 18th birthday. In New York, he joins his old friend, Bing, and two others as they squat in an abandoned house in Brooklyn's Sunset Park neighborhood. Miles uses the return home as an opportunity to reconnect with his parents and mentor Pilar from afar, while each of his housemates struggles with their own self-discoveries, and his father, Morris, deals with his own shaky marriage and his fears of mortality.

While the book starts out being narrated by Miles alone, after a point his voice is joined by those of his housemates and both of his parents, publisher Morris and actress Mary-Lee. Each has a unique viewpoint and each character occupies their own space with their own unique voice. I found this book tremendously compelling and thought-provoking, as it was both about big and small ideas. This is a story about relationships, self-confidence (and the lack thereof), discovering your true self, baseball and seizing opportunities that come your way. I found the ending a little too melodramatic and predictable, but it also left me to imagine what the next steps would be in the characters' lives.

After losing her mother at an early age, Lexi had no choice but to drop out of college so she could go home and care for her only surviving parent. Lexi was completely selfless in sacrificing her future so that she could care for her father for the next eight years, however, once he passed away she found herself in the position of being 28 years old and not having a direction in life. With help from her new neighbor, Hope, Lexi decides to go for her dreams and pursue a career in advertising.

Enter he new boss, Vincent Drake, the carefree boy she loved in high school, has now become a very successful (and arrogant) advertising executive. Lexi is mortified that she is now working for her high school crush, and worries that she'll have a problem keeping her emotions hidden. Vincent, on the other hand, doesn't even remember who Lexi is and treats her with very little respect. Lexi finds that Vincent isn't as bad as he's made out to be, he likes things a certain way, and she discovers that if she keeps him grounded in a routine, stays a step ahead of him and is organized, he drops that tough exterior and she can make him laugh...which is pretty hard to do considering how closed off he is from everyone. After a few failed romances, and a current one with the life-sucking banshee, Jade, it's hard for Vincent to not be a little jaded when it comes to the romance department. Over time though, Vincent starts seeing Lexi in a completely different light and he realizes that she is an invaluable addition to his world. The only question is can he ever learn to trust her before it's too late.",3,"[-2.269250602634818, -0.9180159047006166, -1.0986932914262901, -1.0454854886762583, -1.2883051929151148]",-0.9180159047006166
2382,"This wasn't a bad book but it was nothing more than the usual.

The hero had been a pirate, but he had been seeking revenge more than he had riches.  He had received a letter blackmailing him into returning to England, and he was intent on facing the person and killing him.  But he is unjustly arrested and thrown in jail shortly after getting ashore.

The heroine was a young woman who was also on the run.  She had attempted to kill her uncle.  She had been living by her wits, but she too was arrested and put in jail.  Both she and the hero are to be transported to London for trial.  To hinder any escape the jailers shackled them together at their ankles.

The reader has to be able to suspend rational thought at that point.  I wasn't completely capable of doing that.  Instead of lusty thoughts, I was wondering how they were going to handle their bodies natural functions while chained together.

I have to also admit I was a bit put off by the difference in their ages.  He was thirty-eight while she was twenty-two or so.  I suppose her character was supposed to have experienced the hard side of life so she knew what she wanted.

Wow, this book elicited a lot of emotions from me while reading. The beginning had me totally hooked due to serious angst and sexual chemistry between the leading woman and man (Chloe and Tyler) but then the book took a completely different direction from what I was expecting. It wasn't a bad thing, just unpredictable, which I suppose is a good thing!

Dina Silver's writing is fantastic - just so clean and easy to follow and you feel like you are right there in the thick of it. I really liked Chloe. She was a very strong female character who was not afraid to speak up and express what she wanted except, perhaps, when it came to Tyler. She always believed she loved him more than he loved her and just wanted to make him happy. Unlike many women, however, Chloe knew how to separate what her heart wanted from what would truly make her happy. I found that trait to be very admirable.

I laughed throughout this book and I cried throughout this book - especially during a scene where Chloe finds out that she has been betrayed. It was such a powerful few chapters that I couldn't put down my Kindle.

My only issue with this book was the ending. While I do believe that Chloe probably made the right decision in finding her ""bliss"", I wish there had been a bit more leading up to it so that I could truly believe in the choice she made and the happy ever after she was given. As it stood, it came a bit out of left field for me.",3,"[-1.4953084107363273, -0.9217917279952099, -1.096685408042385, -1.0203137001323046, -0.9190002005010269]",-0.9190002005010269

I'm not really sure where to start this review. I started this book going in blindly, the only thing I knew were the rules. Five simple rules...should be easy, right? 1. Dont sleep around. 2. Dont kiss and tell. 3. Be nice.  4. Dont text or call.  5. Dont fall in love.  I soon found the only easy rule was rule #1!

Basically the story is: Mirella and Gabe are a happily married couple that have a hot, passionate marriage. From the start you love these two together. You love their connection and you are just happy that they are in a passionate relationship after 18 years together. I was almost tempted not to finish the book after the first 2 chapters because I loved Gabe. So, one night they innocently meet another couple, Weston and Bridget, on a rare night out. The two couples just connect and have a wonderful dinner.  Mirella finds herself very drawn and attracted to Weston. Weston is the nerdy guy or so Bridget loves to tell everyone. Bridget seems to flirt non-stop with Gabe who doesn't mind at all and gives it right back.  After this chance meeting things start to get interesting. I don't want to ruin it for anyone, just know that a proposition was made and you are screaming to Mirella and Gabe not to do it but yet you are secretly wishing and chanting ""yes, yes, hell yes!"" Decisions are made and lives changed.

The story flowed wonderfully. I did not want to put it down! I laughed at parts and cringed at parts and felt all the emotions which is surprising for me. I normally do not like books were I'm torn between two men. But I just kept thinking, there are rules in place and most importantly rule #5 so all should be good....right?

This is the first book I've read by this author and it won't be the last!!! The book doesn't end on a cliff hanger... well, until you read the excerpt for book 2!

1253,"As others have mentioned, the Atlanta background and the grind of everyday policing are well written in Out of the Blues.  Sarah Alt, nicknamed Salt when her rookie name badge was written as S. Alt and she was partnered with a black cop who then picked up the nickname Pepper, is an interesting and believable combination of tough cop, spiritual seeker, and hobby farmer.  In Out of the Blues, her character is thoroughly sketched in, and it will be interesting to see it develop in future installments, for which I'm already hoping.

Salt loves the blues, both because of their attachment to Atlanta's history and because of her own attachment to her late father, who was also a cop and committed suicide on Salt's birthday.  A primary struggle in her life is the conflict between trying to accept his powerlessness against the depression that took his life and her inability to understand the choices he made.

As the newbie in the homicide division, Salt finds herself assigned to a very cold case involving an overdose death of an up and coming blues artist.  A convict Salt helped send to prison has come forward with new information, claiming that the death was no accidental overdose.  Salt is forced to go interview him in prison and finds that his mental illness is out of control; still, he drops just enough of the right names and circumstances to make her wonder if there might be some truth to his hate-driven raving.

The one thing that bothered me about Out of the Blues was its choppy construction and rough segues between scenes and chapters.  More than once I had to stop and think about what was happening here, because there was no apparent connection between what had just happened and what was happening now.  The connections became apparent quickly, but it was a stumble that took me out of the story each time.

When he is asked by Lola to help her navigate the dating world and app, Tap Left, he accepts, but that doesn't mean he has to be nice to her. They share a past that is not all rainbows and unicorns and neither of them has let the pain incorporated with that past go. At times, Daire can be mean and cruel to Lola, but, once he has his head screwed on right, he becomes her protector, too. And the past they both cling to in order to put distance between them will ultimately bring them together with the unsaid feelings that lie right beneath the surface.",4,"[-2.0486761929574673, -1.704245847071609, -1.262435072766862, -1.0532665789079207, -0.9225350810921131]",-0.9225350810921131

Their Sunday school teacher even expressed her favorite kind of candy, black jelly beans. One of the other Sunday school classes was putting on a play called The Easter Story, and the bears were excited to see it. The bear children were attentive as the story of Easter was acted out on the stage, with props and costumes representative of the time when Jesus was performing miracles and teaching his followers. Some people became angry with Jesus, and accused him of becoming too powerful. The story continues with Jesus' arrest, crucifixion and resurrection.

Jan & Mike Berenstain have created another wonderful children's book in the Berenstain Bears tradition. The illustrations are colorful and true to the subject matter, and The Easter Story is very well told and appropriate for younger children. This is a book that can be used each year when Easter approaches, and passed down through the generations. I found the book to be well done and enjoyable, a story that children can understand and remember. I recommend this book for families with young children. This edition of the book also contains a sheet of stickers for children to use with their Easter projects.

1034,"Murder on the Mind is a very absorbing work.  The premise of Jeff Resnick's experience of waking up from a coma with the 'gift' of second sight lays the groundwork for a really good mystery.

What I found most appealing about this book is that the characters felt real to me.  Generally I find that most books come across as literature's answer to Hollywood.  The majority of lead characters are described as being amazingly good looking.  The only people who are average, or heaven forbid, homely, are those characters who are less important or villainous.
I really liked the description of Maggie.  She isn't 21 or a bombshell.  She's not 5th Avenue chic.  She's a regular woman with a hairstyle that might not be up to the minute.  What Jeff first notices is her curves, but what he comes to appreciate quickly is her heart.  This, as much as the interesting plot, won me over immediately.
The other characters in the book are similarly human.  Even those gifted with good looks and money are shown from the inside as well as the outside and we get to see some of their appealing vulnerability and dissatisfaction with life.  I found this relatability to be extremely refreshing.

There were two hitches in this book for me.  One was that the action could tend to lag a bit.  However, I chalked this up to the writer laying the groundwork for the characters.  Even when this story was done, you knew that these people had more to tell you and I wanted to hear what they had to say.

Secondly, Jeff, whose instincts...even those not related to his 'gift'...were pretty sharp, showed a suprising lack of diligence towards the end of the book.  The reader could see what was coming a mile away...and not in a good 'Aha!  I see where this is going' way.  I felt myself wanting to nudge him and say, ""C'mon, Jeff...you are smarter than this.""

The heroine is seeking revenge for the murder of her father.  She, her mother and sis are all in danger, and more than one attempt had been made on her life.  Her brother had disappeared and she wasn't sure if he was still alive.

She is pressured by her uncle and aunt to go to London for the season.  They think she needs the change in her life and to think seriously about finding a husband.  What they don't know is she dresses as a man and drives a hack during the wee hours of the night searching for her father's killers.  And that is how she meets the hero.  His carriage breaks down and his driver insists she take the hero - a duke - up in hers.  This wasn't what she wanted to do as it would put her passenger in danger.  That is exactly what happens.  The villian's lackeys attack and her ruse as a male is exposed.

The hero is written as being a very cool sort of fellow, who does only what he pleases and a man not easily moved.  But he didn't come across as that at all.  He was putty in the heroine's hands from the get-go.  He immediately sets out to help her in her quest for revenge.

They are caught in a compromising situation and he intends to offer for her.  She is attacked, he rescues and suddenly they marry.  Then follows several descriptions of marital relations.

I just couldn't get into the idea of defusing her rage through sex.  The scenes were just melodramatic -- not anything that touched my heart.  None of it touched me.",2,"[-1.9899737027725632, -1.2619251426617586, -1.0074513671563228, -1.0192476330767668, -0.9230086972339806]",-0.9230086972339806

This book takes place in the Appalachian mountains of N. Carolina in 1970. Life is hard for people in these mountain villages. Domestic violence is a generational thing and opens the first chapter, with Roy Tupkin beating his wife, Sadie Blue. Chapter 2 is about Sadie's grandmother, Gladys Hicks, now a widow. There are flashbacks to when her husband Walter used to beat her up. These 2 chapters upset me with the generational domestic violence. But the story improves as the characters develop. There are descriptions of mountain ways of healing and kindness.
The book is organized into chapters based on individual characters and narrated in the first person by that character.
Some other characters:
Eli Perkins--a preacher and a kind, gentle man
Prudence Perkins--Eli's sister, never married and a mean spirited woman who lives to hurt people
Kate Shaw--a new teacher from the valley and considered an outsider
Two quotes:
Gladys:""Times like these I wonder if I ever been happy. From the start there's been a film of dingy on my days.""
Eli: ""I first heard about a murder of crows at the seminary.""
My wife frequently says ""If the creek don't rise.."" Her grandmother grew up in the Appalachians and I suspect my wife picked the phrase from her grandmother. So I decided to request this book from NetGalley. I liked the ending.

Burnham was the visionary who was largely responsible for the success of the 1893 Chicago Worlds' Fair, commemorating the 400th anniversary of Columbus' discovery of the New World.  Holmes took advantage of (mostly) vulnerable women who made their way to Chicago on their own, killing them when he tired of them.
The story of the fair or of the slaughters would have been interesting books on their own.  Weaving the tales took away from the story of the fair.

726,"Sellevision is Augusten Burroughs only novel, to date, and having read all of his works it is safe to say that his forte is nonfiction.  Although the plot is a good one, characterization is weak in this text and characterization is what makes for the best fiction. Still, it is an enjoyable read.
The novel is a little dated, it was published in 2000, and I had to often chuckle at characters who express shock and amazement at email, and photos being sent as JPEG files, etc. It is not a weakness of the text certainly, just a reminder of how much the world has changed in the 14 years since this book was written.
As already mentioned you can tell that fiction is not Burroughs strong suit. There are often instances of overwritten lines, and moments where there are insignificant details given that a good editor should have trimmed for him. The characters are also rather flat, but some of them are so enjoyable and funny that you cant help but forgive this. The most delightful character in the text is Peggy Jean Smythe. She is very one note, but Burroughs play that note well and so you forgive the fact that she is one dimensional.
The strongest aspect of this novel is its humor. There are many whip smart laugh out loud lines in the text. There are moments where the satire is so biting it stings, and it is lovely.
The last chapter is the novels weakest, and the book ends on a bad note. It is not clever or fun and a letdown from some of the good moments that preceded it. It ends almost like Burroughs ran out of steam and ideas.

Sir Edward Danton has lost the girl he thought he loved and is going off to hide for a while. In Rye, he runs into his old friend Jules, who is also coming to hide out with his supposed broken heart after being thrown over for another. Jules has a plan though, Star Berkley. Edward didn't think the gal was any good for his friend, what surprised him was that he wanted her for himself.

Star Berkley was in the country with her brother Vern instead of taking London by storm. Not only was Vern ill, he was burdened with money issues their father had left behind. In his desperation Vern had turned to the wrong people. Seems there could be worse things than losing your home, much worse.

While I normally avoid the paranormal genre, I do love a good ghost story. Emphasis on good. The story and the ghost. Im not into evil or creepy paranormal beings, thank you. I very much enjoyed both the story and the ghost in The Perfectly Proper Paranormal Museum. It always helps when there is a compelling historic mystery surrounding the ghost, in addition to the present-day mystery plaguing our main characters. But not to worry  if you aren't into ghosts at all, this book is definitely more cozy mystery than paranormal suspense.

Along with the mystery  full of suspects that kept me guessing (my prime one was killed off early on so much for my amateur sleuthing abilities lol)  a very light hint of romance threads through the plot. And when I say hint, I do mean that. The hint solidifies into something more viable toward the end, but remains just out of reach & sets the stage nicely for further development potential in future books.

Im not sure yet if there are one or two possible romantic interests for Maddie.  The clear frontrunner is hunky Mason. But theres definitely some sort of electric connection between Maddie and Slate.  I just cant tell if its romantic or something else.  Perhaps some paranormally-type connection yet to be revealed.

Bottom Line: The Perfectly Proper Paranormal Museum is unique, well-written, and fun! The quirky museum, the array of likable characters, a curiously intuitive cat, and a ghost who may have been wrongly accused  these elements all give a creative twist to the usual cozy mystery formula.  With enough romantic potential to satisfy people like me, it also is the perfect choice for people who prefer more mystery than kisses.

However, the theme of forgiveness implied in the title intrigued me enough to give this book a go. It is a sweet story, so the title of Sweet Forgiveness is right on the mark. However, the naivet of the main character in what I know is a cutthroat business (television news) was a little much to swallow. No one would rise to the heights this protagonist has in a pretty substantial market like New Orleans could be so easily duped.

However, the overriding theme of the forgiveness stones was a nice one to contemplate, if stretched pretty far as well. The idea of the stones is a bit convoluted, but interesting. You receive a pouch with two stones in it from someone who seeks your forgiveness for something they did to you. You are to return the stone if you do, in fact, forgive them. The second one is for you to send to someone whose forgiveness you seek. Neat idea, but as the book proves, sometimes an Im sorry is not enough. And that is where it ends up. The sweet story comes to a satisfactory conclusion, but the notion of forgiveness remains, as it is in real life, messy, and that is the redeeming factor of this book. It doesnt sell pie in the sky outright, but tempered with a bit of reality.

What you're getting are the bluetooth buds, a small and nifty flat micro-USB charge cable, an assortment of earbud tips and ear hooks (3 different sized pairs each) and a soft structured carry case to carry the buds and all the assorted accessories in one handy location.

Sound quality and performance of the earbuds are better than expected. Sound field is very good with clear articulation across the spectrum and smooth, buttery bass output. Bluetooth connectivity (on my iOs devices) is flawless with no drops or hiss within 10-15 feet of my phone.

Comfort is not an issue even after 2-3 hours of usage in your ears.

Daniels does a fairly good job at distinguishing his thriller from the generic pack and that is much to do with the well described characters. Kale really has good reason to be messed up. Sturgis has good reason to need his help. There were a few times when I felt the plot was getting over-populated with details and characters but it ends up serving a purpose. There is genuine tension in the plot with some decent twists and turns. The pacing was good as was the dialogue and I appreciate that there was room for humor too. All in all, it was a good solid read that kept my attention from the first to last page.",3,"[-2.8584143534889623, -1.6120753810191206, -0.9261816416447726, -0.9598719333957152, -1.0989933139431711]",-0.9261816416447726
2516,"This is a great book by Nancy Naigle. Elli Eversol spent every summer in Sand Dollar Cove at her grandparents beach house. When a hurricane hits the small town and damages the pier and the shops. Ellie returns to help rebuild, she launches a Buy-A-Board campaign to help raise funds. Brody Rankin is looking for a location for his companys new mega warehouse and he is eager to scout the North Carolina beach town. Brody sees an online request for a handyman to help the Buy-A-Board campaign and figures that while he is scouting the area he might as well help while he is there. The more time he spends with Elli he starts thinking that they are meant to be together.

9299,"Though ""Infamous"" is invariably compared to ""Capote"" (starring Philip Seymour Hoffmann and released the year before), there is room for both films to co-exist as each takes such a different approach to the story. Infamous depicts Capote with all his simpering ways and gossiping airs, but also reveals his basic insecurity and how he struggled to achieve relevance and meaningful relationships. The oddly symbiotic relationship that evolved between Capote and the killer, Perry Smith, is at times heartwarming and at other times almost painful and embarrassing to watch.

I couldn't picture Sandra Bullock as Harper Lee initially, but she also grew to inhabit the role of the straight-talking, plain-looking and pragmatic author - before she became famous for her singular work - To Kill a Mockingbird. She was just a friend and accomplice to Capote, occasionally setting him straight when he seemed to be veering too far off course with his quest to find the human story in the Kansas killings. They are the ultimate ""odd couple"", but each scene in which they both appear is lively and interesting and compelling.

Daniel Craig as Perry Smith was almost unrecognizable. At first, I wasn't certain it was him because of his darkened hair and eyebrows and brown contact lenses which obscured his bright blue eyes. His raw animal strength and magnetism simply stole every scene in which he appears. It's easy to see why Capote was sucked up into his energy field and fell for him. Who knows whether he really resembled the real-life Perry, but the character he portrayed was complex and compelling.

The film sets veer from stark gray scenes in the prison to the sumptuous dining rooms of the New York City social scene inhabited by Capote. The re-enactment at the Kansas farmhouse where the Clutter family was murdered is unflinchingly gruesome. This is first rate entertainment, and has inspired me to re-watch ""Capote"" and re-read ""In Cold Blood"". Good movies do that to me - make me want to view or read more about the story....",4,"[-2.39773087084955, -0.9273789553669995, -0.9732254921085901, -0.9889391511984917, -1.2602542283376403]",-0.9273789553669995

4287,"I got this as a Kindle First several months ago (free on the first of the month for Prime members) and just got around to reading it. Sorry, Mr. Freeman. Had I known what I was in for, I would have read it that day.

This is a tale of psychological terror (no pun intended). Women are killing themselves all over San Francisco, without any apparent reason. The only connection between the women is the psychiatrist (see, if it had been a pun, I would have said psychiatric horror!) they have seen for acute fear. The psychiatrist has removed the fear the victims have felt by a variation of hypnosis. The deaths are taking a terrible toll on that psychiatrists practice, so she closes it until why this is happening can be solved.

As the toll on the psychiatrist continues unabated, the toll on her marriage also continues. She and her scientist husband have had a loveless marriage since her father died and her sister moved in with them. Her fathers death was attributed to suicide, and this bothers the psychiatrist. Something is just not right.

In the meantime, the detective assigned to the suicides, meets a young woman who was with the first suicide. She reminds him of his little sister, who was the victim of a murder herself. As he was the one who found his sisters body, this is one memory he wants to erase.

Working together, very uneasily, the detective, the young woman, and the psychiatrist race to find the person responsible before another suicide occurs. What happens next is something you will not see coming.

I truly enjoyed this book. I mean it when I said had I known it would engage me so completely, I would have finished it long ago.

2793,"A fascinating futuristic view mixed with some current technology.  So much futuristic that an aircraft carrier, that as far as I know was struggling to make sea trials is on location in Asian seas.  The story revolves around drone technology, some may already exist or at least are in the works.  The whole plot rocks and I for one am a big supporter of the concept.  Some observations: the nuclear reactors are a new concept for me, as I went through the US Navy Nuclear Power program and then on to serve aboard two different nuclear submarines.  I am a fan of PWR (pressurized water reactors), but certainly open to newer and cheaper technology after someone proves it to me.  I have been aboard new USNS Sealift Command ships and while they are impressive, including the Captains stateroom they are nothing like the opulence described in this story. Drones have been in use for a good while, although nothing on the scale described.  And finally, a woman POTUS.  A story that grabs you with an iron grip, unfortunately the proof reading was sloppy but not to the point of distracting from the story.  The extraordinary use of the drones minus the boring details of their construction allows the story to flow easily, captivating the imagination.  To think a drone can be used to slip into a country, poison a terrorist thug and slip out all unseen should have military contractors scrambling.  I have heard there are currently drones the size of flies that are in use as spies.  More complex than just a story about drones the characters involved are themselves an interesting tale, plotters, schemers, politicians, military leaders and the lives of a conglomeration personnel from varying backgrounds, many with a tragic past.  Finally, I think the idea of using sneaky devious little machines to slip in and destroy a supply of weapons of mass destruction, all unobserved, and leaving no fingers of accusation to be pointed is genius as opposed to at least one allied country using fighter bombers to just flat out unapologetically fly in and destroy the weapons that would destroy them.

9321,"In the 50s and 60s outside Rio de Janeiro the Brazilian government isolated the poor by building a huge ghetto a distance from Rio de Janeiro.  The ghetto turns into a sizeable city that continues to grow as more people are bussed into the poverty of the area.  The film pushes a message of where there is poverty there are also dreams of something better. The two common means to achieve these dreams are either hard work or escape of the cruel reality through drugs.  The later choice is the common alternative as it is easier to obtain and offers a quick fix to the problem, since hard work that pays enough to escape the ghetto is difficult to find.  As the story begins, the audience is introduced to the young boy Buscap&eacute;, the narrator, whose brother is a member in a small gang called The Tender Trio.  Buscap&eacute; tells a tale of the how ideas lead to the quest for the ""better  something"" as The Tender Trio seeks the holy grail through robbery.  However, these robberies seems futile as the real money lays with those who control the drugs.  As drugs become more accessible the drug dealers begin to control their own territories, and in Buscap&eacute;'s story the greed for more leads to a bloody path lined with murder and tragedy.  Through Buscap&eacute; the audience is enlightened about the birth of violence which is related to the drugs and greed in the city called the City of God.  City of God is a strong and disturbing film as it depicts young children being victims of the violence or as the actual assailants as the gangs demands the loyalty.  In addition, the films message is enhanced by terrific cinematography and a well written story, which is based on true events and individuals.  City of God offers a brilliant cinematic experience that will not escape the mind of the audience as it pulls the audience through a painful story that continues to take place in the ghetto outside Rio de Janeiro where one person dies every 30 minutes from violence.",4,"[-2.258885235974218, -1.1894523323953852, -0.9288392024901085, -1.024354208838796, -1.0495933945129667]",-0.9288392024901085

9373,"This seemed like a somewhat forced attempt to create a trilogy for a series that really did not need one.  It, of course, brings back Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker and director Brett Ratner for the third installment of the buddy cop franchise.  The main focus is still the Lee/Carter relationship and elevating them from friend status to that of family.  Overall though the characters are what they are, and there is really no more room to develop them.

This time the bulk of the story involves the characters in France, trying to track down the list of the leaders of the Triad.  The scene stealer of the movie is anti-American sentiments from a cab driver (Yvan Attal) who eventually becomes an important and funny ally. Carter gets the girl in this movie, played by the gorgeous  (Noemie Lenoird) who is more important than she initially seems. There are also supporting roles by Max Von Sydow  and another great martial arts movie alum Hiroyuki Sanada, whom Ratner had to basically beg to return to the genere.  There are also tie backs to the first movie involving counsel Han, now Ambassador Han and his daughter.

Ultimately the Rush hour movies are what they are.  While I do not necessarily think this movie had to be made, chances are if you loved or enjoyed the first two, you will probably like this one too, although maybe not as much.  If you were lukewarm to the first two, then you may not like this one all that much.  For extras, you get a lot.  There is a commentary track on the movie by Ratner and the screen writer, trailers for the movie, and a second disc filled with a couple hours worth of making of and behind the scenes features and a production diary, which basically followed from the first day of shooting to the last.  It was interesting hearing Ratner describe doing the things in this one that he wanted to have in the others, like Chris Tucker getting beat up by a bunch of kids in a Karate Studio, a ""Reverse Game of Death"" type fight scene with a Chinese giant etc.  If you like going through bonus material you will really like all you get here.

With Play Dead, his sixth book, Rosenfelt continues to be one of the freshest voices among today's mystery writers. This stems from his ability to provide interesting plots, credible courtroom drama, lots of humor and well-developed major and minor characters.

In Play Dead, Carpenter's devotion to dogs and legal skills merge when he must not only rescue a dog but bring him to the witness stand to reopen a five-year old murder case which sent the dog's owner to prison.

The backstory was just as entertaining, but what will stick with you when you're finished is the main character's story of love and devotion.

The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time tells the tale that beginning with the dog in a middle class English neighborhood through the eyes and in the voice of a high functioning autistic boy who wants to know what happened.  Such a story might fail on many points, becoming saccharine, the author lapsing in the voice of the narrator, or even taking the story in some unreal direction.  Haddon avoids all these pitfalls delivering instead a poignant and entertaining tale.

Most interesting of all, Haddon does a wonderful job at brining the narrator alive and making the reader understand his unique condition.  On matters of human emotion, the reader recognizes things long before the autistic narrator.  At the same time, avoiding conventions that would portray the protagonist as weak, simple, or stupid, Haddon creates someone we respect for his problem solving ability.  Indeed, the narrator often solves mysteries long before the reader, but in ways that remain both believable and credible.  Haddon further deftly gives us a window into his thought process and makes us feel just how alien our world can be to someone who does not understand emotional nuance.

With its careful prose and rich story, readers will surely appreciate Mr. Haddon's considerable gifts.  Highly recommended.",4,"[-2.3238227108343077, -1.3506393626711315, -1.0964571176921432, -1.0156576050897048, -0.9313789502740019]",-0.9313789502740019

He is married to his true love, Lorrie, has a child and two dogs that complete his happiness, is in partnership with his best friend in a business that finds homes for dogs.  What more can he want?  But each book about him gets him involved in a situation in which he must defend a client in court who is charged with something major.  To work on these cases he assembles his team and gets to work; with a good amount of tongue in cheek asides thrown into the mix creating novels that attract and keep a faithful cadre of readers.
  Our tale begins with what looks like a breeze.  A good friend of Andy, Martha Boyer, known affectionately as ""Pups"" has been reported by a neighbor as having too many dogs in her house.  The legal limit is 3, but Pups has quite a bit more.  She takes in stray dogs, raises them until they are old enough to be adopted and then finds good homes for them.  The complaint is answered by the town council who seem quite ready to order Pups to cease and desist.  When Andy is asked to defend her he readily agrees and expects a quick acquittal due to the time being close to Christmas and people are in favor of what Pups does.
  But wait; the plot thickens and does so rapidly.  The neighbor that reported her is found dead with the sight of Pups running from his house reported to the police coming to investigate what is a murder. Evidence is against Martha Boyer, and Andy now finds himself defending her on a charge of homicide.

From the back cover:  Love finds you

A mysterious outsider casts a long shadow on Ohios Amish country.

Policewoman Rachel Troyer has always looked after her three elderly Amish aunts, proprietors of a farmhouse inn near Sugarcreek, Ohio. The idyllic town is popular with tourists, who come to sample its famous Amish goods. But one thing is clear to Rachel  Joe Matthews is no tourist. When the bearded stranger lands on her aunts doorstep, begging shelter for himself and his young son, Rachel is suspicious. Will she be able to uncover Joes secrets despite her aunts  and her own  growing affection for him?

Let me start off by saying that I sincerely hope that Ms. Miller has a sequel to this story cooking in the pipes somewhere.  This story is absolutely terrific! Sugarcreek, Ohio seems like a really nice place to hang out in with the people to meet and the places to see.  Rachel Troyer is the kind of cop you always want around and to be friends with.  Joe Matthews is a mystery and Rachel doesnt trust him.  Then there is a murder and a killer to catch.  On top of that there is the romance.  Love Finds You in Sugarcreek, Ohio is great fun to read.  Ms. Miller has a great way of telling the story and moving it along at a nice pace.  Her characters are wonderful and she give them life and unique voices.  All this and Sugarcreek, Ohio also.  A really enjoyable read.

So goes the opening line of Anna Karenina.  But it could as easily apply to the Cartwright family - seven living sons and one daughter in the fictional town of Struan, near Crow Lake, in the backwoods of northern Ontario at the end of the 1960s.

The narrative shifts between three family members - patriarch Edward (written in the first person), who is generally absent from his family life; Tom, the eldest son and drifter, who abandons a promising career in aeronautical engineering after the suicide of his best friend; and Megan, the foundation of the family, who at age 21, escapes from voluntary family servitude to a more fully realized life in London.

The choice of Edward as a first person narrator is deliberate; he holds the key to the disintegration of the family as he struggles with his past, diving into his mother's diaries and calling forth memories of an abusive father.  All three of these characters are struggling to reach (or escape) from their potential, but the focus of the book is Megan, whose story is that of every woman who strives to redefine her role - indeed, to redefine herself - as the consequences of her departure echo throughout her family.

""If you kept walking south and east eventually you would hit civilization; if you kept walking north and west you would hit Crow Lake, where the road comes to an end,"" one character muses.  It's a fine metaphor for the Cartwrights, who, in some essential ways, have come to the end of the road and who are muddling forth to find direction.

As in Mary Lawson's past novels, the writing is beautifully authentic...the themes of family loyalty and personal sacrifice versus freedom and self-actualization are convincingly rendered...and the characters are achingly real.

The book looks at how hard it was for the United States to develop spies in Russia in part because of doubts about their authenticity and the real threat of the KGB.  A Russian then offers intelligence to  the United States only to be doubted at first. He would then become one of the CIAs biggest assets.

The book looks at how Adolf Tolkachev approached the United States and why he wanted to spy on his own country. It looks at how he was vetted and how he passed information to the Americans. The book also looks at how this information helped the United States.

This is a well documented book. It reads like a spy novel but it is written with an eye to detail and offers detailed support for what is written. This is fact that reads like fiction, which makes it an extremely enjoyable read.

I am glad I got to read about  Adolf Tolkachev and all he did.  As the description about this book on Amazon explains, Mr. Tolkachev was eventually betrayed. I won't go into details about how and what happened but it was the only thing about the book I wish were not true.

2163,"House Of Echoes is a very atmospheric ""scary"" reminiscent of the ""good old days,"" when ""scaries"" didn't have to be filled with vampires and the like to be suspenseful. Without going into detail about the plot, I'll just say that House Of Echoes is a tale of how a young family's dream of a better life by moving to an estate in a small village in upstate New York turns into a nightmare.

To his credit, Duffy, in his debut novel, does a very good job in making the reader clearly feel that he/she is right there with the Tierney family every step of the way as they work to restore the sprawling estate, in their efforts to fit in with their new village neighbors, and as their lives start to turn into a living hell.

This book just oozes with atmosphere!

However, Duffy's focus on atmosphere tended to dominate this book, and resulted in this reader experiencing little ""first hand"" thrills and edge-of-the-seat suspense until the last quarter or so of the book. Put another way, Duffy kept the pace of the book in second and third gear for too long before shifting into fourth gear.

Further, Duffy fills the book with characters that are serviceable enough to maintain interest in the story; but, in my opinion, they are not developed well enough to really care much about them. Further, when an author takes the time to describe how much the family dog is loved and then has it disappear, he should at least spend a little more time on creating some sense of emotion about it from the family members.

Despite these flaws, I enjoyed House Of Echoes enough to consider reading a second book by Brendan Duffy to see if he has further developed his potential as a suspense writer.",2,"[-2.9736039535217347, -1.2950788602485903, -1.415788867890817, -0.9962166752816959, -0.936223260593889]",-0.936223260593889

I enjoyed getting back into the world of [book:Elite|17729036] and gaining more understanding of the guys' points of views.

I love this series as it is funny but also quirky at times, makes me laugh and also try to figure out who the killer is.

The baby calling it a bump is annoying. Maddie is pregnant in this book which I am ok with. It is the clueless of her about having a baby and how at times she won't really refer to being pregnant but just kind of point to her midsection and call it the bump. Very annoying not to mention her behavior towards it--no caffeine as she has read it is bad for baby but thwn going to a loud music blaring club? What the heck?

The good--the story.  Dana is still dating Ricky and he is part owner of this new hot club Crush. Dana and Maddie go to check it out and Maddie comes across some who died. Looks like from a vampire because of the bite marks on the neck. Against Ramariz telling Maddie to not get involved she does as her and her gang think the vampire angle should be investigated. Sebastian host vampire theme parties and Maddie and gang are convinced that is what ties it all together.  With a lot of eye rolling going on and the multiple stops to pee due to the baby Maddie and gang are determined to find out who the killer is.

I really enjoy this seties and can't wait to read the next book in line as I am sure Maddie will have her baby. Wondering how she will track a killer and handle motherhood and baby at the same time.

She, along with her daughter Julia (Lawston), are taking her husband's dead body with her on a large plane that she helped to design.  She falls asleep, and when she wakes up, over the Atlantic Ocean, she discovers her daughter is missing.  A calm look around the plane quickly decends into mania as Julia is no where to be found.  With the help of Carson (Saarsgaard), an air marshall, she begins a more thorough search only to find that no one remembers her with a little girl.  In fact, Julia may just be in Kyle's imagination.

Jodie Foster carries this movie.  It is hers all the way, and she is a good part of what makes it work.  Unfortunately, what will make or break the movie for most viewers is their acceptance of the explanation behind Julia's disappearance.  I find that it is a stretch, but still works.

Many people will relate. I personally find great enjoyment in cooking and remember when I was first married, I bought many many many cookbooks and loved trying new recipes on friends and family.  I got a wok and a fondue pot and enjoyed trying some new adventures with food, ones that my ""good 'ole southern mom and grandma"" had never cooked.  I even made some big mistakes in cooking, just as some of Heidi's students.  Teaching a cooking class also seems a wonderful way to have some fun and earn some money for folks like Heidi.

It was enjoyable to see how Nyx realized she was unhappy and lived only a half life and what she did to change things for the better. I would have liked a bit more background on Adam though. It felt a bit like he was only a secondary character but really he was the catalyst of Nyx's development.
It was also interesting how the transformation of an actor has been described troughout the book. How it feels to transform from yourself to somebody completely different. You not just act like somebody else but become somebody else for the duration. For someone like me without the tiniest bit of talent for acting the process was impressively written.

Olivia, Samantha Pearson, Jane Weston and Collins Davenport meet while being treated for a serious medical condition that could be fatal, but these are not, for the most part, fragile creatures.  They're feisty characters who find strength and a fighting voice in the pranks they pull on doctors and nurses alike.  They vow to stay friends forever - until death does part them.

Twelve years later, Olivia is on a job interview that goes all bad when her interviewer turns out to be a seedy, lustful guy who attempts to pull a pass on her and winds up getting punched out senseless for his efforts.  The readers will cheer here but even more so as the pages turn and Olivia meets FBI Agent Grayson Kincaid.  It turns out that Olivia has unwittingly interfered with a sting operation and now the guy she floored is out for revenge because he thinks she's part of the FBI plot. Add to that Grayson's partner is FBI but a fool who talks and acts before he thinks, which ticks off both Olivia and Kincaid.

But Olivia has her own problem to think about, plotting a strategy to discover what Ponzi scheme her own father is operating.  As an IRS employee and a strongly intuitive gal, she knows her own family members and hundreds of other are being taken in by her father and she wants it to stop.  No, it's not hard for her to do this because her absent father has always been a smooth talker and using her past illness to indicate she is mentally unstable and still not completely healthy, even attempting to commit her to a mental institution.

The plots thicken and the action is fast and furious as is the passion beginning to ignite between heroine and hero.  In the process, her friend Jane becomes involved and what is being done to her will horrify and then infuriate the reader when the mystery is revealed.

Abandoned by his family when they discovered his secret past, Milo Weaver has rejoined the secret CIA Tourism Unit, this time as Tourist, one of the roving amoral agents who carry out any mission no questions asked.  Unfortunately Milo isn't the man he once was, older and wiser, in his time as a husband and father he has grown a conscience.  What is he to do then when he receives the most reviling of orders: assassinate a teenage girl?

Steinhauer's taut plot and breathless prose pull you along, almost daring the reader to try and not turn the page.  His protagonist Milo Weaver, both flawed and charismatic, is most gripping characters I can recall encountering in an espionage novel.  Be warned however, readers are better off starting off with his first novel.  Even if you can pick it up in the middle, much of the nuances and references of the story will be lost otherwise.  That aside, I finished the ""Tourist,"" excited for Milo Weaver's next adventure, now I am left awaiting the third with equally baited breath.

1207,"_Farewell My Lovely_ was written in 1940, and it shows in the way in which African-Americans especially (but also Jews and women) are referred to and portrayed.  The racial epithets, the expectations (just shy of stereotype), and the place these groups have in society are all reflections of pre-feminist, pre-civil rights America.  At first this bothered me, but taken in context, it is a telling snapshot of LA (and America) at a certain time; don't let this dissuade you from the book.  The dialogue is classic noir, the plot (while a bit stretched), loads of fun.

The book begins at a trot, and quickly escalates into a run as Marlowe is unintentionally pulled into a cyclone of violence, corruption and deception.  Pulled into a bar by a behemoth of a man, by the time they both leave, two men are dead and another has a broken arm.  Marlowe's large friend, the murderer, just of of prison, is searching for the woman who framed him.  As the story progresses, you never really know how the pieces of the story fit together - no one (except of course, Marlowe) is who they say they are, the interrelationships and connections between characters never certain.  And while the conclusion to the story is both implausable (I wonder if Chandler found himself written into a corner or if he intended things to resolve the way they did) and awkward, the experience is akin to riding a roller-coaster at night: it is thrilling, exhilerating and you want to do it again.

773,"When I'm not reading something important (go ahead and define that however you like), my brain-candy of choice is detective fiction, and ever since I discovered Louise Penny's Chief Inspector Gamache stories, they have been on the top layer of the candy box.

Penny provides an interesting locale (Quebec) and tight stories.  Any loose ends are always the kind that inevitably remain in real life (Does Ruth's duck come back?  Will the inspector catch onto what's going on between his daughter and his assistant?  Will they?), with the plot lines tied up neatly and believably.

The characters, too, are complex and contradictory in the way real people are.  Gamache isn't an always-right do-gooder; we've seen him mistakenly send a beloved character to prison, and he continues to wrestle with many of the horrors seen in his line of work.  We know he will investigate the mystery thoroughly and carefully, but we also know he can be wrong.  The residents of the Three Pines community are a close-knit bunch, but they, too, have friendships, successes, failings, and biases just like those we all have.

As with most good series novels, A Trick of the Light can stand alone as an introduction to Louise Penny's work or be a satisfying continuation of familiar characters.  The glimpses of the inside workings of the art world are interesting and intriguing, and enough is left to set up the next book in the series well, without making this one feel unfinished.

I found myself on the edge of my seat throughout most of the book because while you think you know what's going to eventually happen, and you want it to happen, the author wrote the story in such a way that you were never really certain.

I especially appreciated that all of the love interests were good catches rather than there being one ""right"" guy/girl and one ""wrong"" one.

400,"Did Ian Fleming want to kill 007 at the end of the previous novel, ""From Russia with Love""?  In the final paragraphs of that book, Rosa Klebb kicks out the deadly poisoned spike in her shoe and jabs Bond before she's thrown into a laundry basket and hustled away by Mathis and his assistants.

So I was curious as to how Fleming would resurrect Bond for the next novel, ""Doctor No.""  He does a decent job of explaining away how 007 survived, but there is no mention of what happened to Tania--which is something I'm curious about as I read the novels this time.  (At the beginning of ""From Russia with Love,"" Fleming describes the demise of Bond's relationship with Tiffany Case from ""Diamonds are Forever"").

Although Bond delivered the girl and the Spektor cipher machine--and survived his encounter with Red Grant, the total psycho killing machine--he's treated as if he screwed up and sent to Jamaica to look into the disappearnce of another agent.  A little job in the sun that shouldn't take much effort.

Well, this is James Bond we're talking about here, so we know he isn't going to get much of a holiday out of the piddling little assignment.

""Doctor No"" has the lean, fluid style that keeps the story moving.  It's set in the Caribbean where Fleming lived and wrote all of the Bond novels.  I focused more on his description of Doctor No while trying to keep the image of the painfully-Caucasian Joseph Wiseman out of my mind (he was the actor who played No in the film version).

I would put this novel in the same category with ""Diamonds are Forever"": a strong action story with a couple of over-the-top moments that, although they worked while reading it, look a little strange with some afterthought.  In ""Diamonds"", it was the Italian gangster who liked to dress up like a cowboy in his own private Wild West town.  In ""Doctor No"", it was the obstacle course and giant octopus fight.

The best novels are ""Casino Royale"", ""Live and Let Die"", and definitely ""From Russia with Love.""

And so while it shouldn't come as a complete surprise to me, David Nicholls' terrific book, One Day made me sob. I mean, I came completely unhinged. Egads.

Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew connect at a party the night they graduate from college in Edinburgh. Dexter is good-looking, popular and privileged, fairly unaware of the world around him except where it directly affects him; Emma, of middle class origins, considers herself to be a bit non-conformist, although she has had a bit of a crush on Dexter throughout college. They nearly sleep together, but spend about a day and a half in each other's company. And this sets in motion a connection that spans nearly 20 years. One Day follows the peaks and valleys of Dexter and Emma's relationship on the same day--July 15--each year. Sometimes they're close friends; sometimes they're not. Sometimes one is romantically involved while the other isn't. Sometimes one experiences career success while the other struggles. One of the characters refers to Emma and Dexter as ""Harry and Sally,"" and there is definitely elements of that film relationship in theirs. But the book is funny, thought-provoking, emotionally charged and even a little maudlin from time to time, especially if you're a sap.

This is a book about love, in many forms--friendship, romance, sexual attraction, marriage, parent/child relationships, unrequited crushes, etc. As Emma says at one point, ""Love and be loved, if you ever get the chance."" The book may be a bit predictable at times, and sometimes the characters aren't completely likeable, but I found this tremendously compelling and gripping. It has been optioned into a movie, and as much as I hate most film adaptations of books I love, I will definitely need to see this one, because much as its main characters felt about each other, this book has gotten hold of my heart.

I liked that it wasn't just a book about sex.  While a panty melter is always appreciated, firstly, I liked that the two main leads were acquainted with each other already and knew the basic superficial gist of the other while later developing into something more.  I'm not going to lie and say that the game changer one night stand was a new ploy that I haven't come across before to get the love story going.  I've come across MANY of those before and now.  But, I liked how these two progress from having a mutual attraction always but never acting on it, to eventually lovers, and then taking it a back step and building from a mutual friend (*with of course benefits*--- that I cannot leave out) relationship and later to each others other halves was a great way to go for me.

Then you're in luck. This author has crafted a perfect little naughty fantasy that starts with high stakes and ends with lots of pleasurable moans.

This is so much fun. Professor Nolan has a wild encounter with a gorgeous girl without realizing she's his student. When they find out, the bond is strong and lustful. I loved how chivalrous he becomes in helping her, only to entangle his two friends into the mess of desiring a young woman that poses all kinds of inappropriate temptation. I liked the way their budding relationship jumps from forbidden desire to daddy games.

It was a good idea that Cora's experience with these men started with one, and grew in numbers together from there. The sinful love fest is fun, though I admit my favourite parts were when they were one on one, first with Nolan and later with Garret ;-) Though as a team, they put on a very sportive show!

The final part is full of sass and naughtiness. I always like that part where the characters solve a big problem and the we get to see what becomes of them. Great fun!

Jason and Katie made a really sweet couple.  Best friends turning something more- hard not to like that.

A year has passed since Toby's last adventures left her exhausted, wounded and barely alive, and someone close to her dead.  Now she is focusing on training Quentin as her squire, doing her job as Sylvester's knight and trying to make her life go by in a normal way, but her life is ragged and worn due to her decisions and what she's done.  Then there's the question of Tybalt, the King of Cats, who's a whole issue on his own.

And then she is asked to help once again, as a friend and fellow knight, Etienne, reveals to her that his daughter has been kidnapped.  This comes as a shock to Toby, as she didn't even know he had a daughter, but that's because he's kept secret about it, as she's half-changeling -- like Toby -- and lives with her mother in the human world.  Her name is Chelsea, and like her father, she can teleport.  But because she is young and just coming into her powers, she is able to open doors and gateways that shouldn't ever be opened; places that haven't been accessible for centuries.  She also can't stop herself as she's on the run from her kidnappers, but also because she can't control her powers.  If they don't stop her soon, she'll end up tearing Faerie apart.

Just another ordinary day of mayhem and adventure for Toby, though this time the stakes seem higher than ever.  And she can easily identify with a half-changeling not knowing what is really going on and how to control her powers, and if this were to get out about Etienne, it would ruin him.  Plus there's Tybalt who keeps lending a helping hand and is always there when she needs him, and Toby really needs to work out what her feelings are about him.  Just another ordinary day.

4050,"This was quite a different story.  I wasn't sure what to expect from any of the characters, but I found myself unsure as to whether William was truly a heroine or something else.

Thirteen girls find themselves being held captive by Master William.  He says he's brought them to his home to save them, but the girls aren't so sure of that.  Number 13 is the story of how one girl manages to break through the icy walls surrounding their Master to discover the broken man who thinks he's saving them from a greater hell.

Despite the being held by William, each of the girls and William himself, are trying to overcome some sort of evil that happened to them in their lives.  Whether the evil was through their own action or those of others, they each learn how to connect with people again, learn to trust.  It was an easy road for any of the girls or William, but by the courage of one girl, Number Thirteen, they all fight, learn and trust their way into an unlikely family.

It was hard to figure out exactly what William was up to, especially when he dispensed with his method of punishment, but there were times I forgave him because he was just as messed up as the girls.  In his mind, he was doing what was best for these girls, providing them with a home and teaching them skills they can use to live happily n the house.  I didn't really start to like him until he started engaging more with the girls and realized that he, just as much as them, needed to learn how to trust and learn to be something other than the young teenager who was attacked and hurt.

This book was different than I was expecting, but in a really great way. I think, at least for me, when you think of a book set in the art world, you expect them to be a little snooty and the characters were anything but...Tobias is really intense, in a way that keeps Zara, and everyone around him, on their toes. I loved it, I loved the twists and turns, and I loved the reveal, although I think there were enough clues that I wasn't surprised in the least. But, if you aren't paying attention, they are subtle, and you will miss them, if that makes any sense.

Zara and Tobias have a fantastic first meeting, and I loved this book from that point on. I loved that their first meeting wasn't perfect, it wasn't with unicorns and rainbows, but rather felt like a real life situation a number of us have been in....a slightly embarrassing moment that is then witnessed by someone else.

As this is the first book in a connected trilogy, there is a lot of time spent setting up the events, and the characters, so they are able to move through all of the books. But, it was balanced well with action, and scenes with Zara and Tobias that you felt like the story had momentum.

This is my first title by this author, who I initially heard of at a panel discussion and thought the books, and the idea behind them seemed interesting. I am definitely glad I requested this book and I am looking forward to the other 2 in the series.

After raising her family, Faith wants to do something else with her life.  Her husband is very successful but hardly ever home.  When he is, he takes her for granted.

Brad lives on the other coast with a very successful wife.  He is a lawyer, but tends to want to defend the underdog which drives his wife, Pam, crazy.

9482,"""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" opens with a landscape of hardscrabble poverty that could be many places: I was totally unfamiliar with the plot, and thought perhaps it was set in Africa). Gradually the story is developed, centered on the lives of six-year old Hushpuppy, the introspective and often isolated daughter of Wink. They live on what most would consider the wrong side of a Louisiana levee, in an isolated community known as ""The Bathtub"".

Wink and Hushpuppy are both struggling with abandonment (Hushpuppy's mom left the family under circumstances never fully explained), and Wink also suffers from other maladies. His drinking (and that of many of The Bathtub's adults that are his peers) is evident from the beginning. It's also clear that he has other medical issues. Eventually, after a hurricane has come and gone and profoundly disrupted The Bathtub's residents way of life, Wink has to tell Hushpuppy about the leukemia that is killing him.

Throughout this movie, Hushpuppy is influenced by other adults, some that come and go and some that stay: the Bathtub's regulars, the women who populate a floating catfish restaurant and nightclub, the folk healer who teaches her and her and other Bathtub kids some of the hard truths about the world (""we are all meat...""). She is also aligned with the natural world around her, the rhythms of rural livestock, and their eventual role in placing food on the table.

The beasts of the title are aurochs, symbolic of fear and loss that appear in Hushpuppy's visions of the world. And make no mistake about it: it is a world that is wet and dirty, with adults streaked with violence, devoid of true warmth or connection (""I can count the number of times I've been picked up"" she says at one point).

Zara, I've been waiting for this story because in a way I felt some kind of connection with her character in past books. And she didn't disappoint.

Zara, this girl is my spirit fictional character. She's made mistakes and some of those made her a tough cookie. She might seem rough around the edges but she's really a beautiful soul on the inside.

I enjoy seeing how both characters embraced their journey throughout the story and let their experience help them grow. They struggled but they took it one step at a time and they survived.

870,"I really enjoyed this story and have already purchased and read the second in the series. I was going to just review the second book but decided I would start with this one. It is one of the first books I read on my new Kindle in April and could hardly put down to get anything else accomplished. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes a good adventure and some zombies. By the way, I felt the military aspects, the description of the guns, weapons, etc., just gave it authenticity. Read it!

I love this series. I read it years ago when it first came out but there are more books in the series now so I am reading them all again. I love Captain Lee Harden and his military training. He is sent down into his well prepared bunker to await instructions, to not leave until 30 days after he finds that the social and government parts of the US civilization has fallen. His mission is to find survivors and organize them, bring them supplies to keep them going.
But when he rises out of the underground bunker he finds what is really meant when the social and government structures have fallen into lawlessness.  His mission becomes very challenging when he sees the infected to have no mission except to eat others.

This is well written and I see the author D.J. Moles, has released a newly updated version of these books. I am rereading the ones I already have and will then buy the newer releases of the later books I have not read already.  If you like post apocalypse books, zombies and handsome male protagonist who is very capable you will like these books.

677,"When Kate's husband, Dexter, is offered a lucrative position in Luxembourg, there's no reason not to accept. Not only does it mean more money and a more comfortable living for the family, but it also means that Kate can leave her job and start fresh. And for Kate that means more than you might think. Kate was recruited to the CIA in college and has led the secretive life of a covert agent for years. Even her husband has no idea what she does for a living. But now that's all behind her. Until Kate and Dexter meet another expat couple living in Luxembourg. Kate is sure that they are not who they claim to be, but is she right? Or is she simply bored living the life of an average housewife? As she digs into the identities of their new friends, Kate becomes convinced that not only are they lying, but that they may be after Kate... or Dexter.

EXPATS is great fun and I'm not the only one who thinks so. Pavone's debut recently earned him an Edgar Nomination for the Best First Novel category.

The book is broken up into alternating sections, beginning with present day Paris when Kate runs into an old friend. One she's not too happy to see and one that's not revealed immediately to the reader. It's clear, though, that Kate suspects she and her family are in danger. Flash back to two years ago when Dexter is offered the position in Luxembourg and the couple decides to relocate. The third set of pieces concerns Kate's time with the CIA -- beginning, end, and throughout her career. So what you get is a series of alternating chapters with cliffhanger endings: Kate discovering something present day, flashing back to Luxembourg, switching gears to her exploits as an agent. The pacing of the story is quick and borders on dizzying with all of the storylines, but Pavone pulls it off.

It would be easy to chalk Kate's fear up to boredom as she investigates Julia, Bill, and even Dexter, but those present day chapters manage to appear each time confidence in Kate's instincts begins to wane.

THE EXPATS is perfect for readers looking for a cleverly plotted and thrilling sort of light espionage read (and by that I mean one that isn't heavy into the political parts of the espionage game).",3,"[-2.459002820995995, -1.2107047141302485, -0.9443548548723757, -1.0034868111479023, -1.510802494792081]",-0.9443548548723757

Harry Bosch is in a period of his life where he is not a detective, due to litigation where he is suing the LAPD for wrongful termination.  His half brother, Mickey Haller, a defense attorney, needs his help in proving that a client, accused of a horrific murder and sexual assault, is truly innocent, although the evidence puts him at the scene.  Harry reluctantly agrees to look over the case, he does not want to be associated with getting a murder suspect off, that would be going across the line and that was a line no self-respecting police officer ever wanted to do, it would be tantamount to treason.

With a 30 year old top secret defense project clouding and confounding his investigation, Puller finds while he has plenty of people who want to help, he can trust no one. At the same time, vague, unnamed elements are trying to terminate his Army career by any means.

Puller is in his classic form as an investigator, seeing things every else has missed. The second story with Paul Rogers, although telegraphed early on as a central player both surrounding today event as as well 30 years earlier intersects with Puller in unexpected ways. Coincidentally, he is a sorta of physical version of King and Maxwell's idiot savant computer whiz, which might offer some interesting possibilities for future stories.

Mason first receives a warning and then a beating, instructing him to lose the trial and ensure Mitchell is convicted. Mason realizes his only option is to stand up to Trent, but a at the risk of his life and those he loves.

Even though this was written by Dick and Felix Francis, I'm going to refer to them as singular.  Francis has such a wonderful voice.  He has a way of drawing you into the story, a way of explaining things that make the information fascinating and an excellent ear for dialogue.  I appreciated his including information on English law.

Francis creates great characters.  His protagonist isn't particularly brave and strong, but he is stubborn and determined, and his villains are about as villainous as they come.  I liked that he made the point about not understanding how hard it is to stand up against violence and intimidation.  It was nice to see the hero actually get the girl in this story.

The story was similar to a horse race in that it milled out a bit in the beginning giving you background information, took off with sudden action and built in pace and suspense up to the end.  Even the courtroom scenes, which were so well done, had an element of suspense.

Portents are something I normally hate and the one early in the book wasn't necessary.  I also don't usually like when authors hold information back from the reader, but here it worked.  Thinking back, I probably could have anticipated many of the turns in the plot, but I was so engrossed in the story, I didn't take the time to analyze as I read.  And that's what makes Francis, Francis; you jump on and go to the end.  The ending is violent and bothers some people; however, I felt he addressed the age-old question of legality versus justice.

He wants you to like him and believe he's a mensch, but a highly gifted and slightly eccentric mensch. He succeeded.

This is not a literary book.  It is a conversation, with all of the self-absorption along with more than a little self-deprecation that such introspections typically bring.  But, Feynman's work product continues to be a huge force in physics today and he worked with and knew many of those more publicly exposed scientists of the 20th Century. That makes the conversation worth listening to without the speaker picking up the bar tab. His science is wonderful.  His morality...not so much.

Reading the book, it is almost impossible not to draw comparisons between what Feynman was able to achieve under the conditions and tools available to him at that time, and the work of some of the leading public science advocates today.  Feynman doesn't lose in the comparison.

Elvis is currently bed-ridden in the nursing home as a result of a stage accident where he broke his hip three years ago.

I was drawn to this series, because the main character was as interesting as the murders he was investigating. Lately, the books have taken a different path concentrating on the criminals, doing their crimes and Lucas putting the clues together (with a lot of help from his friends), without much going on with his personal life. In fact, he's become like one of the detectives in ""Law and Order"", that solves the crime, but you never get involved with their personal life. Lucas is settled and somewhat boring at this point. The novel fell short with action sequences but kept a steady pace, lacking in nail biting moments. It tried for some of that good cop humor, present in so many books of this series, but seemed to miss the shot on that as well.  I will keep reading the series though, as they are interesting, although different from earlier novels.",2,"[-2.827943365912354, -0.9676449522509122, -1.0708639300371, -0.9493283483937613, -1.44449204385556]",-0.9493283483937613

To me this book was hard to get into.  I put it down several times. I felt the story was a little boring until about halfway through. After that I remembered why I like Long so much.
I'm glad I had read the other books first and was determined to finish it.  After the halfway point it was great!!

The first main scene suggests a storyline filled with a cocky hero who is determined to score some major bow chicka wow wow with a hard-to-get sports reporter. And... that's a big part of the first couple chapters but this book includes so much more than just romance. There is a sports element (duh) and a strong family piece that is really lovely. Also, as the characters' backgrounds are fleshed out, themes addressed include elder care, co-dependency, addiction, neglect/abuse, and the challenges women face while trying to succeed in a male dominated field.

At first I thought this was a simple and sexy romance but it turned out to be much more than I expected. It's not perfect (view spoiler) but I enjoyed my reading experience and I give the author a lot of credit for moving the story beyond the bedroom.

7133,"First, I borrowed this book from my one of my favorite places, the Mead Public Library(picture of book attached) in my hometown.

 As an out of the closet male reader of Historical and Regency Romance, I found this book to be very enjoyable and very kind to my wounded heart.

Ms. Galen takes you into this story about Armand, Comte de Valre, a young man who is wounded both mentally and physically from his time in prison. He has lost much of his will to socialize even though he is freed to regain his rightful place in the world.  As I read this tale, I could relate to his struggles on a very personal level and I felt a relationship with him I have seldom felt in the stories I have read.

His family hires a tutor to guide him back into life, Ms. Felicity Bennett. She is a young and beautiful lady who seems to knows more about Armand then he finds comfortable with. She is also wounded but by the dealing of her own family and by the man she is betrothed to marry.

Neither one of these two will know, at first, that their pasts may cause a problem neither seems capable of solving.

To say anymore would give you, the reader, too much information that i may ruin your read. I will say that Ms. Galen will take you on an adventure which will make you cry, laugh, feel pain, and totally mesmerize you. Ms. Galen's is writing style is smooth and descriptive.

Take a few hours, days, or whatever you need to fall into this story.",3,"[-1.3306060797175148, -0.9549008429874897, -1.1219057951368452, -1.0305365647687876, -1.1654839959543968]",-0.9549008429874897
2024,"The Homecoming is book 6 of the Thunder Bay Series by Robyn Carr.  It is an excellent book just like her other books.  The characters are realistic and well developed and the plot is exciting and clear.  The book is easy to read and easy to keep up with the characters and the different elements of the plot.
Seth Sileski and Iris McKinley had been best friends since they were six years old.  They lived next door to each other and Iris felt she was just one of the boys of Seths family.  That is for a while, until she began to see Seth in a different light.  Seth, however, continued to see her as his best friend.  Their friendship broke under the stress over prom.  Seth was never sure what happened and Iris never told him.  What could have happened to create this breakup of a longtime friendship?
Seth had left town for college and then the NFL with the Seahawks.  The money went to his head a little and he bought himself a silver Ferrari.  One evening he was racing along the mountain roads, luckily slowing somewhat when he came to a crossroads.  He had the right of way but was speeding when he hit the truck that missed the stop sign.  Seth hurt his leg and one ended up being shorter than the other.  The other man was paralyzed and remained a quadriplegic.  Though it technically it wasn't his fault, Setj went to Oscars house to apologize.  They became very good friends.  How was this possible?
Seth returns to Thunder Point as Deputy to repair the damage his accident had created between him and his father and to reacquaint himself with Iris if she would let him.  He wanted to be her friend again since she had been his best friend and he missed her.  Can Iris who is the high school counselor allow herself to become friends with Seth when she really wants more?
Iris is confused by her feelings towards Seth.  His return did show her that she had no business dating Fellow teacher Troy Headly when she only wants to be his friend.  She just has to convince him of it.  They work together when a case of bullying comes up in the high school.  What must they do to protect the kids involved?

Gracie and Noah were both very easy to like.  Starting with their childhoods, it tells of their journey through the years from friendship to love and how their different backgrounds and family differences destroyed this with a shattering secret resulting in Gracie jilting Noah. Moving on 8 years, Gracie returns home to attend her fathers wedding and encounters Noah again, discovers he has a 5 year old daughter and both realise their feelings never went away...

It has great secondary characters who all bring valuable content, particularly Noah's daughter Sophie; she was a feisty little girl flitting between sweet and innocent to being a little monster and her cheeky and innocent comments lifted the story and made me smile.

This story was great, I had my suspicions of what caused Mark to leave after he and Chris had a instant chemistry from their personalities. I enjoyed the constant run-ins between Mark and Chris, the universes way of telling them they need to be together. I liked to see how Chris was able to socialize and connect with Mark's daughter. I was slightly pissed when Lucas came in the picture with the history he has with both men, and I did not like Mark's reaction to it. I was glad that an event occurred that forced Chris and Mark to talk it out.

When a second body has the same wounds, he knows he has a pair of serial killers on his beat. But knowing about serial killers and finding them are two different things. Especially when the killers seem to plan their strikes carefully and their escapes even more carefully. Jesse's small-town police department becomes even busier when a high school girl is gang-raped by three schoolmates. Jesse has no evidence and the rapists threaten to ruin the girl's life if she tells, but Jesse intends to bring whatever justice is possible.
Jesse's professional life is busy, but his social life is packed. He can't get over his ex-wife and she certainly won't let him. And every other woman he meets, with the possible exception of one of his fellow cops, is ready to fall directly into bed with him. Jesse is willing to do the bed thing, but he makes it clear that he's waiting to resolve things with the ex-wife--and the resolution he wants is a return to their marriage. Since their relationship seems completely sick (as confirmed by their psychologists), that isn't an especially desirable thing for the reader but it is what Jesse wants.
Robert B. Parker is an excellent writer. His characterization of Jesse Stone is strong and rings true. Jesse tries to live his life by a sharply defined set of rules--love is forever, justice is important, revenge is worth having, physical violence can solve problems or at least make things feel better, and talking too much is a big mistake. Jesse's treatment of the young rape victim is sympathetic and nicely handled.
Fans of Robert B. Parker won't be surprised by the difficult relationship Jesse maintains with his ex-wife--this is a recurring theme in Parker's fiction. Jesse knows he would be better off if he could just get over Jenn but he can't. From a reader's perspective, I certainly wish he would. The woman simply isn't good for him. Rules and ethics or not, I find Jesse less sympathetic and more pathetic because of his hopeless love affair. STONE COLD is a short novel with plenty of white space. I wish that more had been devoted to the mystery and less to Jesse's miserable love life--especially since all sorts of attractive, friendly, and relatively healthy women are lining up to spend time with him.",2,"[-1.3247655818517705, -1.0766195305721893, -0.9573887967768914, -1.0126312753489564, -1.2175718614054802]",-0.9573887967768914

""Hands"" is a truly great story and demonstrates Anderson's uncluttered prose and ability to pierce to the heart of a character.  His style influenced Hemingway and others, though Hemingway later saw the need to lampoon Anderson.

The story that struck me on this reading is the opening vignette about the ""grotesques.""  It does set the tone for the book, and perhaps demonstrates that all writing is really about the grotesque in our selves and our conduct that somehow reveals, at once, our individuality as well as our universality.  On the latter, the grotesque is attractive precisley because the freak resembles us and we see ourselves in him.  The stories tend to be about sadness and disappointment, but I suppose that's what makes them true stories.

After he saves her from trouble a connection is made, but what will her father Liam Callahan think?

Kelly Callahan works with her family at Callahan's Bar in Boston and they are setting up for their busiest time of the year St Patrick's Day. Whilst she is arranging the bar the delivery arrives and with it a dimpled, cocky man who leaves a lasting impression on her and a possibility of a date.

Ben Affleck's latest film is a memorable dramatisation of the CIA's rescue of six diplomats from Iran and does a great job at providing tense dramatic action with some dark humor thrown in. Although there a few mistakes from the era that aren't totally accurate, I think Affleck does a good job at recreating the situation in the late 70's with Iran. Some with say that there is some dramatization of the CIA's role and I won't argue that, but for the most part I think it provides a good feel of the situation at that time.

3186,"The title and the description of this book is misleading. Everything that is described in the synopsis takes place in the first few chapters of the book. With the title, I thought the story was going to be about a building romance between Amber and Liam, but I was completely wrong.

Amber and Jake are siblings, and Liam is Jake's best friend who lives next door. Jake and Liam are the same age, Amber is 2 years younger. Amber and Jake grow up in a home with an abusive father who sexually abuses and attempts to rape Amber when she's 13 years old. Jake and Liam catch Jake's father in the attempt and end up beating him up and threatening him to never come back.

Meanwhile, since Amber was 8, Liam has been sleeping in her bedroom every night to help fight off her tears and nightmares from the abuse. They do this practically every night for the next 8 years to the present time when Amber is 16 and Jake and Liam are 18. Jake and Liam are the hot guys in the class attracting the attention of all the girls. Amber is annoyed by ""day Liam"" who she considers annoying and self centered, but adores ""night Liam"" who comforts her. Then practically in 24 hours there's a bet on which girl at the school will be the next to lay Liam. Amber starts changing into this confident girl for Liam tempting him more sexually and he's got her on his side and within a week, they're boyfriend/girlfriend sleeping with each other. Woah. That was very sudden. Amber starts off very much disliking the girls that hit on Liam, but sure enough she's changing her wardrobe to impress him. Amber's mom and Liam's parents find out that they've slept together and spend every night together. They're okay with this. Really?

Then, there's news that Jake and Amber's father has decided to move back to their town to reconnect. He has since remarried to a woman who has a 17 year old son and they have a baby together. The 17 year old son attends the same school as Amber and Jake.

After this point, I actually liked the rest of the story because there was an actual story line and Amber came back as a strong heroine. Liam was a strong character throughout.

600,"SUM: FORTY TALES FROM THE AFTERLIVES BY DAVID EAGLEMAN: There is one absolute certainty in this life and that is that we are all going to die, at some time.  Battles, wars, and crusades have been waged and fought for days, years, and even centuries over what exactly happens when we shuffle off this mortal coil and . . .

From David Eagleman, who heads the Laboratory of Perception and Action at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas and is the founder of the Initiative on Neuroscience and Law, comes a unique and unusual book called SUM: Forty Tales From the Afterlives.  With a strong cover quote from Philip Pullman, SUM presets forty ""What ifs?"" as Eagleman ponders the many possibilities of what might exist in the next life, if there is one.  For some it would be a fantasy come true, for others a nightmare; a personal heaven, or a feared hell.

Eagleman approaches the book from a scientific point of view, analyzing each possible afterlife in an empirical way and weighing its validity:  some entries are short, some are long; some have a lesson to teach, others propose a moral at the victim's expense.  And what can the reader take from SUM?  Don't expect to be convinced one way or another from Eagleman on whether there really is an afterlife.  It is a collection of entertaining stories that at the very least will stimulate the intellect into dreaming of another world.",2,"[-1.0499693097112026, -1.4578779144676557, -0.9593197191027412, -0.9990447576157894, -1.3141447096579784]",-0.9593197191027412

5761,"I like this series of books. They are totally different from the suspense/mystery novels I read. This series is set in the 1300's, which requires methods of detecting and investigating than what we have today.

The main character is Hugh de Singleton, who is both a surgeon and bailiff. As I commented on an earlier book in this series, I find the methods of surgery and doctoring in that day fascinating.

This book, Trail of Ink, starts off a bit slowly, but then picked up and grabbed my interest. The story involves stolen books, and I figured it wasn't going to be a story involving murder and mayhem, but I was wrong. Thought it may have been slower getting to the suspenseful moments than the two books that preceded this one, it has a lot of suspense in it also, and even some romance thrown in - although that is also a lot different than modern day romances.

The author has studied medieval surgery and medieval English, and that comes across in the book. Reading his books are like stepping into medieval times. He paints a great picture of what life was like in that day, and adds mystery and suspense to make it even more enjoyable.

I have one complaint about the book. There is a glossary in the front of the book to define some of the unfamiliar words in the book, but there are still several used that are not in the glossary. I would have liked a definition of those also.

I highly recommend this series.

The Wayward Saints are back at it again!  This time around it's Casey (Anslie's best friend) and Gunner (Brantley's cousin and WS member) who are hooking up.  Told in multiple POV, this second installment in the Wayward Saints series tells the on-again, off-again story of Casey and Gunner.  Not quite as much action in this one as in Wayward Angel.  However, that can be chalked up to Casey's hesitancy in hooking up with a biker.  That being said, there is still plenty of action and LOTS of hotness!  Casey and Gunner are definitely NOT shy in the bedroom.  Most of the characters introduced in the first installment, come back for an appearance in this one.  Plus there are new additions as well.

GRIT by Author J. C. Valentine is book one of a Spartan Riders Novel, a new MC series.

""I had a craving for a teacher.""

Predictability and routine are necessities in Gabby Morgan's life. She is in her first year of teaching kindergarten, and she wants to get everything right. So, when Blake Mahone and his son, Ash, enter into her life, they threaten to derail her manicured picture of perfection.  Blake Mahone is the hot-as-sin president of the Spartans. He is a newly single dad, trying to learn the ropes of fatherhood, when he has a run-in with an angel. Things heat up as Blake and Gabby learn more about each other and how they fit in these seemingly different worlds.

""I love the way you look at me. I like the way you feel in my arms. You make me want things I shouldn't, but I can't help myself. Every time I touch you, I need more.""

Told in third person point of view, GRIT was a sweet and fun read, with some twists.  The synopsis of the story was what initially drew my interest, MC romance with a taboo twist. This theme remained throughout the story, but also deviated slightly from the typical MC read, giving its own unique take.  The main characters were easy to come to know, but still had depth. The fabulous mix of adult and child dialogue was my favorite part of GRIT.  Little Ash stole the show, bringing a childlike quality to an adult-themed book.

The divorce was tough on Eva and I admired her pluck. She heads to Key Largo and a brand new beginning, buying a worn down little motel and fixing it up.

The author kept the romance real. With Eva just divorced it wasn't an instant love thing with her contractor, Mike. In fact, the fun thing about it was Eva didn't like him at first. Those kind of romances are always a delight to read about. The clashes. The first sparks. It makes finding out if they get together or not that much more fun. Especially after Evas ex shows up with divorce remorse.

As the motel took shape, it was fun to learn of Evas ideas for it and how she puts her own signature on things.

A sweet, fun beginning to the romance series. If you like them light and humorous, this is one for you. Perfect for reading by the pool or a cold winters day when you wish for summer to come.

3286,"""Within These Walls"" is a paranormal thriller/horror story in the style of Stephen King and Dean Koontz. If you like reading books by those authors, you will definitely enjoy this novel. The plot is not necessarily unique in this genre (a writer and his family in a haunted house), but Ms. Ahlborn puts her own spin on this often used scenario by throwing in a charismatic cult leader and convicted murderer as the main antagonist. And, did I also mention that the murderer is imprisoned throughout the story and bad things still happen outside the prison walls? Well, you'll just have to read the book to find out how all of that unfolds...

I enjoyed the way the novel was organized; switching between the present day and the past to tell the back story made the book more interesting.  The protagonist is a true-crime writer, so the author playfully used a few police incident reports, paranormal investigators' findings, and news stories as a bridge between past events and the present. Besides being fun, these helped the story move along, which was definitely needed at times. (The author mentions that this is the longest novel she has written, and, I personally believe the story could have benefited from a little less unimportant and mundane detail in some areas.)

With half of the story set in the 1980's, I definitely appreciated the (sometimes humorous) references and homage to that time period. All in all, this is a decent ghost story with a ""twist"" by a gifted writer.

When all 3 return broken and battered, Pax seems to be the key to healing. When Keller is hired as Rick's live-in aide, will other issues arise which could tear the 3 apart again?

My rating: 3.5 Stars

My opinion: While I enjoyed this book, particularly the WWII aspect of it, I must admit that this wasn't my favorite of the author. I found the telling it from multiple perspectives (4) was highly confusing and broken up. As a result, while I loved the overall storyline, I found it was a bit more difficult to get attached to.

1489,"I was a little hesitant going into The Dominant, as I am with any book that provides an alternate perspective. So many times I just end up bored and feel like I am reading the same story all over again with nothing new. That is not what happened at all with The Dominant. It was definitely the same story, but it was also a lot more.

With the story we get to see the other side of the coin, see how Nathaniel felt throughout the whole ordeal, and see how much he cared about Abby, even from the very beginning. The whole situation was as hard on Nathaniel as it was on Abby. He struggled with wanting to give everything he had to Abby and solely being her Dom. He had no idea how much she loved him, he thought she was simply looking for a Dominant.

I personally have never read from a perspective like this. I have always been in the head of the submissive. So for me, this was a new experience and that kept me interested. I also feel like I got a lot more from the story with this perspective. Any questions I had after finishing The Submissive were answered after reading The Dominant. Any time I wondered why Nathaniel did something, well now I know why he did it. Whether it is because I have a complete picture of the story now or what, but I enjoyed The Dominant more than I did The Submissive.

Of course the book is friggin hot. I mean, you knew it would be, but dayumm it's really hot. Probably shouldn't have been reading it on my bus ride home, but oh well. I'm just glad the guy next to me went to sleep and didn't try to read over my shoulder (which has happened before). So yeah, be prepared for some delicious reading.

All in all, The Dominant was an incredibly addictive and hot read. The perspective is original and engaging. This is a read I recommend to fans of the genre.",3,"[-2.217434557731499, -0.9842811531898628, -1.0291615896678334, -1.0178981646446261, -0.9618031575647761]",-0.9618031575647761

804,"As a native of San Antonio, Texas, I have always been fascinated by the history of my hometown, and the surrounding areas. As a young child, I had the opportunity to visit the Alamo and the surrounding missions. I'm not sure about other states, but Texans are extremely proud of their history, so I have read and studied about the Battle of the Alamo in school and on my own for many years. Every once in a while, new details emerge, inspiring new versions of the story of the Battle that took place all those years ago.

In The Blood of Heroes, author James Donovan presents a well-researched and gripping recollection of the events surrounding the Battle of the Alamo and the people who have become notable for it. Drawing on recently uncovered primary sources, Donavan introduces people at both ends of the war in the most life like portrayal I have ever encountered. Using both the spoken and written words of the men, Donovan provides a unique insight into the character of the men and their subsequent motivations for fighting, or not, in the war for Texas independence.

Despite being a work of nonfiction, the story feels like a well-written novel, always describing interesting details while never sacrificing the pace of the action.  I found the descriptions of the weaponry used to be a fascinating insight into the tools that were used during combat of the time period (1836). The 200 Texans, severely under-armed and extremely outnumbered (the Mexican army had thousands), fought valiantly for 13 days. All Texans are familiar with the tragic fate met by the 200 men, but the details brought to light in this book allow fresh insights into the familiar story. Donovan has crafted what is sure to become one of the definitive collections on the Battle of the Alamo.",3,"[-2.8850059649764006, -1.7161490477539143, -1.3093810473839793, -0.9869155020073271, -0.9622260448261268]",-0.9622260448261268

This is a scary book. Don't read this if you are alone at home at night. Especially if you live in an older house. It gave me chills even when I read it during the day with my family around. The author really hit a home run on the scare factor.

The older brother's best-friend trope is one that forms a staple in my reading diet but the thirteen-year age gap between Cooper and Lacey made this a little different.

Lacey was frustrating with her snap, immature decisions, and I confess she took a little warming to, but she's young, flighty and has three protective older brothers to contend with so she can be forgiven.

Storm is one of the twins and him and Wes are the last to be paired off. Storm never thought it would happen with his best friend's widow.

Everly has been on her own since the death of her husband. She only had Tabby and Storm, on occasion, though it was getting harder and harder for her to rely on him. Things have changed, had shifted between them. And none of them knew how to deal with it.

Storm had secrets. Everly would get a huge smack from the past.

While things were pretty predictable, the story line was okay and things were easily solved.

I can't say this was my favorite, I think Luc & Meghan's will always be - along with Decker and Miranda - but I am looking forward to the next book, with Wes.

We don't see all of them by a long shot--it's a very short novella--but what we do see does a nice job of showing the development of their relationship. In between we see Katie spending time with her BFF (mostly while they're talking about Mark/their letters while Katie bakes goodies to send to Mark) and Mark spending time with...well, with Katie's letters.

Then we fast forward several months, until Mark gets out of the military...and finally, Mark and Katie meet in the flesh. (And there's a lot of meeting of the flesh, if you know what I mean ;)) Then fast forward again, and we get a snippet of Katie and Mark's future. Adorableness all around.

This definitely could have been turned into a lengthier book with less of the fast forwarding and more of what happened in the in-between, but as is it's a short and sweet (and steamy!) read about two somewhat relationship-challenged people who meet as pen pals and become something much more. It definitely brightened my morning!

I've read scores of these types of books, and ""The Purpose Driven Life"" is different in several ways. First, it offers you a step-by-step plan for creating a sense of meaning in your life. Second, it's based in scripture. Third, it advocates making the church the center of your life.

These differences can also be the book's drawbacks. I always sensed that the author had a bit of an agenda -- being a pastor of a huge church, of course he believes in the importance and sanctity of organized religion. But what if you aren't a member of a church? What if your church is dysfunctional? What if you feel called to do things outside your church?

I for one believe that God has given us different talents and different strengths and different passions. SOME of us are called to serve in the church. And some of us are called elsewhere. Warren seems to ignore those of us who are pulled to serve others and use our talents outside of our church. After reading this book twice (once on my own and once through a small-group study through my church), I was still left with many, many questions -- and a deep-seated feeling that there was more to life than what Warren had presented.",2,"[-1.1979673098074637, -1.2587505195552655, -0.9644758706900773, -1.0403370832517664, -1.1115060563133539]",-0.9644758706900773

Harper is a young woman who is the sole caretaker for her disabled brother.  She has put him first for so long, ensuring he never gets hurt again, and neither does she.  After wildness and speed have taken everything from her they are the last thing she should want.
Will is a self made billionaire with a super shady past.  As soon as he meets Jeremy and Harper he knows his life is about to change in a big way.
Between Wills violent and shady past and Harpers complete unwillingness to bend this match never should have worked. But it really does.  There are definitely some parts of the story that dragged and had me wondering if either one of them deserved the other, but in the end this was a great story and definitely sets the scene for the rest of the Maverick books.

Pax goes from being a family dog to a member of the WWII Army K-9 Corps, then back to a family dog. The author writes the dog's point of view with significant insight (well, as much as human can, I guess!).

Pax is loyal to all his masters but conflicted as to how respond to them living in the same house. Understandable as they are also unsure as to how respond. His first master returns from the war paralyzed from the waist down and quite depressed.  His second master loves her husband but can't persuade him of that.  His third master doesn't want to leave Pac and agrees to stay.  How will they all adjust to this new and precarious living situation?

In Fuzzy Mud, Louis Sachar explores the dangers of messing with nature.  A lab-created organism has the potential to revolutionize energy production, offering an answer to the world's fuel shortage.  With their rapid reproduction, mutations inevitably occur, sickening people who come into contact with the resulting ""fuzzy mud"" with a fatal rash.

As he did with Holes, Sachar captures the culture and attitudes of teens and preteens beautifully.  As the characters make their choices, good and bad, Sachar opens a window to their minds.  He doesn't settle for simple, type-cast kids, but thoughtful, believable young people.  This isn't a funny book, and deals with rather serious subject matter, but it was fun to read.  His target audience is older elementary school kids and teens, but even a middle-aged guy likes me can enjoy Sachar's delightful writing.

6194,"As with any A.L. Jackson book, WAIT was emotional, gripping, heart wrenching, all consuming and filled with a lot of passion.  When A.L. writes a book, her readers can feel everything she pours into it through the words on the pages.

I didn't know what to really expect from Wait.  I just knew that I loved the first three books and had to read this book as well.  This book took me slightly by surprise because I didn't realize just how broken the characters were going to be.  Austin and Edie truly carried a lot of guilt.  Both put up walls that were hard to break through, but these two were exactly what each other needed.

WAIT is the 4th book in the Bleeding Stars series.  Each book follows the member of the rock group Sunder. (Books 1&2 are both about Sebastian)  These books can be read as a standalone.  There are interconnected characters but the storylines are totally separate.  In WAIT we follow the path of Austin, Sebastians younger brother.  Austin is a young man who is filled with demons from a tragic event that occurred when he was younger.  Carrying around all the guilt has lead him down some bad roads and forced him to make some bad decisions.  That is until he is 17 and meets Edie (Ashs younger sister)  Edie provided the light into Austins dark world.  But Edie is not one without demons of her own.  She went through a tragic event at the age of 14 and has also carried around the guilt and blame for many years.  When these two meet they are like each others balm to their souls.  They finally start to break down their walls and let each other in, until Austin betrays Edie, forcing her to runaway.  Now 4 years later they are reunited. Can Edie and Austin find their way back to each other??  Will their souls finally be able to heal??  Read WAIT to get those answers.

As with all of these books in this series, WAIT will linger in your head well after you finish this book.  I would recommend this book and this series to everyone who loves a book about a HOT rockstar and the women who know how to break down their walls.  If you are a fan of A.L.

He wakes up between seven thirty seven and seven forty in the morning having gone to sleep exactly at midnight.  He watches one episode of Dragnet each evening at the same time.  But only the episodes broadcast in colour.  He sees his psychologist once a week at the same time each week and then he does his grocery shopping - buying the same items every week.

At first sight Edward might seem to be an unlikely hero but the author makes him come alive and I felt a great deal of sympathy for him.

When Donna and her nine year old son, Kyle, move into a house across the road Edward's life is about to change.  I really enjoyed this book and read it in a day.  I loved the writing style and the different view of life which Edward presents.  I liked Dr Buckley too and thought her relationship with Edward was well realised.

The book is amusing and poignant and I thought Edward's relationship with his irascible father was convincing.  The letters of complaint which Edward writes every day - but never posts - add an extra dimension to the story and show a human being trying to make sense of a world which doesn't operate in the same way as he does.

Add to the fact that Gillian, her sister, is also a cop and is assigned the case with her. Mary knows that she will have to let bygones be bygones and bury the past. That's fine till she hears that her best friends killer is still living in the town. The whole reason she left to become an FBI profiler was because her best friend was murdered by Gavin Hitchcock, who Gillian stood beside and believes to be innocent, even though the evidence was overwhelming. Mary say it as a betrayal, hence the tension between both. Now though, with bodies fitting her dead best friend piling up, Mary has her sights on Gavin, but is he truly capable of the heinous way the girls are found?

This was quite long yet I ended up listening to it over 2 days (despite certain issues with the narration, which I'll get to in a bit). I found the character development to be amazing and loved both Mary and Gillian. Every family has their spats and I'm glad to see the girl working out their issues properly. Also the killer was super creepy and being inside hi head was even worse. This author sure knows how to write a disturbingly warped villain!

The plot was relatively fast paced and kept my attention the whole time. I thought that there were certain parts that were kind of disjointed and unnecessary, and the whole sub plot with Marys best friends bit was rushed and seemed to be added as an after thought. Saying that though, I still thoroughly enjoyed this and will definitely try something else by this author.

Now, onto the narration! Hollis McCarthy took a while to grab me. She had such an annoying sing song tone at the start, that totally isn't suitable for such a serious book, that it nearly made me not finish! Also the background noises were so distracting at times. If this had a proper production edit then maybe the tone wouldn't have annoyed me as much. Also, her voices were very similar and it became hard to distinguish who was taking at any given time.

The story of Noah and Callie did not go the way I expected.  I was really glad that it wasn't a case of Callie having a crush on Noah her whole life with him not even noticing her until he was single.  Instead it was a mutual discovery of feelings.  A mutual realization of how well they mesh and all of the sudden seeing each other as something as more than friends.

Noah is definitely a man of action.  Once he makes a decision there is no stopping him!  Another surprise in this story is that he was the worker-bee in the relationship.  Callie and Noah may have had their realizations at the same time, but Noah is the one that accepted that realization first.  I like that he guides Callie more than putting pressure on her.

Callie is a girl after my own heart.  She hates messing with her hair, doesnt wear make-up, is not a fan of shoppingyet she worries these things about her personality are the things holding men back from committing to her.  Like shes somehow less of a woman because she isn't interested in the traditional girly things.

There were some pop culture references that weren't very current.  I had to look at the publication date while reading because it confused me.  There were references to some of my favorite shows from the 80sMoonlighting, Mork and Mindy, Cheers.  I don't think a lot of readers who are younger than 40 will get these references so it seemed like an odd choice for a book that was published in 2008.  But thats really neither here nor there.

As with the first story in this series, I was missing that warm-fuzzy feeling.  And just like in the previous book, I like the characters and I believe they belong together.

Ender was easily likable as well. Not just because hes hot and he can play tennis really well, but the way he treats Adelaide is simply endearing. He doesnt treat her like theres something wrong with her. He likes her for her.

The characters are complex, and not just the usual people you meet on a daily basis. I enjoyed the story  it was fun, sweet, amusing, steamy and romantic.

386,"Nowhere in these plans had he foreseen the weight and shock of reality.

Do you like relentlessly depressing books? Okay, cool, me too. Let me introduce you to Frank and April Wheeler, the married couple at the center of Revolutionary Road.

Set in the 1950s, Revolutionary Road takes place in a time when people clung tightly to traditional gender roles and believed deeply in the American dream. And on the surface, Frank and April have it all. Theyve built a life together in an affluent suburban community. They have a two beautiful children and a nice group of friends. Frank is even eying a promotion at his dull New York City office job.

The only problem, of course, is that the Wheelers don't actually want what April at one point refers to as the enormous, obscene delusion of suburban family life. The Wheelers  April in particular  feel trapped in the hopeless emptiness of their mundane existence, and their mutual dissatisfaction gradually destroys not only their marriage, but their sense of self.

Revolutionary Road is full of heavy, brutal, heart-wrenching dialogue between Frank and April, but the character who really stands out is John Givings, the mentally ill adult son of one of their friends. John serves as the unexpected voice of reason, outwardly condemning that same hopeless emptiness against which Frank and April quietly struggle, yet at the same time exposing the weaknesses and vulnerabilities at the heart of their inevitable downfall.",4,"[-2.5539474490103427, -0.9717106396882962, -1.2182577153350014, -1.0544976428193795, -0.9671604162150953]",-0.9671604162150953

8668,"PURSUED BY THE ROGUE is the first in a four book, multi-author series called Fairytales of New York. The stories are connected by four heroines who have been friends since boarding school. Each story is based off of a different fairy tale. This one is inspired by Hans Christian Andersens, The Ugly Duckling.

I don't know where to begin to review PURSUED BY THE ROUGUE by Kelly Hunter. There are so many layers to the main characters. The story is almost a life lesson in what to do right and what to do wrong - and the impact that parental actions have on their children. It is also a love story between two mismatched souls and how their differences combine to make them perfect soul mates.  They both filled needs for the other that no one else could. It wasn't without problems however, and not without a few bumps and bruises. These two each have a complicated and emotionally twisted past. This book captivated my interest from the first page all the way to the end.

Dawn suggests a no-strings attached relationship with Finn. Finn wants more. Can he convince Dawn that she is more than what she perceives herself to be? Can she overcome her insecurities and believe herself worthy of a happily ever after?

The chemistry between Finbar Sullivan (dont you just love that name?) and Dawn Turner is potent, and unfolds with the perfect amount of tension. Kelly Hunter weaved an intricate and interesting plot. It deals with real-life issues. These two have a lot of issues to work through.  I love how the author dealt with them honestly and realistically. It made me glad that I spent the time reading it. It is not just romance, although there are some very steamy moments between Finn and Dawn. You cannot finish this book without falling in love with Finbar Sullivan!

This was a fantastic beginning to the Fairytales of New York series and another great book from Kelly Hunter! I highly recommend! This story has a little of it all... action, romance, mystery and great characters that leave you wanting more by the end. Yep, I'm a fan and can't wait for the next book in the series.

However, it also has a very contemporary feel to it. So it reads like a good contemporary, but has just enough paranormal flair to make it fun.

Rachel and Charles made a good pair. They complemented each other well and just worked well together. I liked how they just felt drawn to each other despite neither one ever wanting a relationship previously. It was very cute to watch them fall for one another.

I liked how their relationship began because of a mutual dislike and need to get back at the same person but grew into more. It was an arrangement that worked out better than either one could have hoped for. I loved how their relationship was relatively easy and low on the angst. The drama didn't drag on too long and really we just got to watch them fall for each other, which I really enjoyed. They had some great banter and were fun to watch.

I also really loved seeing Noah and Alice again. One of my biggest complaints with Dont Bite The Bridesmaid was that I felt like the story was still a bit open, it concluded but I wanted just a bit more. Well, this one closed everything up pretty well. I liked getting to see them further into their relationship and see where it is headed.

Vampires will forever be my favorite paranormal creature and I will never tire of them, so this was right up my alley. I highly recommend this one to paranormal lovers like myself.

1967,"This series is different from the usual suspense/mystery books that I read, but I have enjoyed reading it. The series is set in the 1930's, and is a bit reminiscent of Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie books in style and setting.

 This is book #4 in the Drew Farthering Mystery Series, and is the best so far in my humble opinion. It was different from the others in that it took place away from Drew's home, who is the main character. This is also the first book that has Drew being married, so that also added a new dimension to the story and his crime-solving.

 There were a lot of new characters in this story along with some of the regulars, and the author did a great job of keeping me guessing as to who the murderer was, and who all was involved in the other criminal activities in the book. She has created a great character in Drew, the detective wanna be who keeps having crimes happen around him that he gets involved in solving. You can't help but like him, even when he gets the police irritated because of his unwanted help.

 The book was a great read, and I enjoyed every minute of it. It was difficult to put down, and the author really outdid herself on this one. The setting and plot was a great one, it was clean and Christian, and very suspenseful. I highly recommend.

Anyway, glad we got that out of the way.  So one of the most famous writers in the Western World turns her direction towards a detective novel.  The oddly named Cormoran Strike is a disabled war veteran asked to investigate the apparent suicide of a famous model. Aided by his new and keen temporary secretary, Strike starts following the trail of those involved to see if it was murder or suicide.

Out of a bad relationship and in debt, Strike is an almost stereotypical private detective.  The author does try to bring London to life and to give depth to the characters.  In fact I found it was balanced between character study and the actual investigation.  Strikes personality and background is gradually exposed as we go through the book.

Sadly I never found this compelling over just interesting and was never drawn back into it to just read one more chapter.  As I have not read the Potter books I am unable to compare styles but it I had to sum this up in one word I would probably select plodding, although it very much speeds up in the last 25% as Strike stops investigating and starts doing.

He then became very reclusive and schedule orientated with little contact with others including contact his two grown children.  The story takes place in England and the characters contain many of the idiosyncrasies of the area.
After his wife's death, Arthur brought himself to finally start to do something with his wife's clothing on the year anniversary of her death.

Without giving away the very enjoyable story of his coming adventures, There were clues on these charms to his wife's life before they met and were married,
Arthur is extremely likable and I feel very appealing to those of us who would fit into his older age group. The book moves along at a gentle and yet interesting pace. This is not a wild, action packed adventure novel. It is more thoughtful with well developed characters and with an air of discovery. It is very well written and flows like a stream over round pebbles. Though I think that any age adult might enjoy this book, it definitely is a book for the mature reader.

Determined to confront her fears, Clare begins to create art from images that come from her memory (she may have observed a satanic ritual) or from her nightmares. As a child, she saw her father go from a loving and caring gardener/real estate mogul, to a man that turned to the bottle because of shame (apparently the big land deal he brokered wasn't on the up-and-up) and regret (mistakes that he has made). While she has never felt comfortable with the events surrounding her father's death, she cannot think anything more sinister was afoot in this small idyllic town. Or could it?

Hoping for a new beginning, ex-DC cop Cameron Rafferty has returned to Emmitsboro following the death of his partner, and accepted the job of Sheriff. He doesn't expect to see anything more serious than a bar fight, which would probably initiated by his mean step-father. And he definitely didn't expect to find love (with the feisty Clare) or have to deal with murdered runaways, slaughtered cattle, satanic rituals or a murdered step-father.

In my opinion, Roberts has created the perfect story of betrayal, romance and sinister happenings. There were several things that made this story exciting and suspenseful ......like missing corpses; people wearing black robes & animal masks while performing sex fueled rituals; troubled teens; animal sacrifices; and a sense of impending doom.

 After the gang makes up with Buffy, they're back to fighting evil together again. They are soon joined by a sexy new Slayer named Faith (Eliza Dusku). She's a loose cannon who both Buffy and Giles have trouble controlling. Soon Angel is some how brought back from the hell dimension. Buffy has to fight off her feelings for him because one moment of true happiness with her would make him evil again.
 The main villain of the season is the Mayor of Sunydale. The Mayor has a big plan to turn into giant snake like creature on Graduation day and have a big feast on students. He also takes Faith under his wing which leads to Faith turning bad and having a big feud with Buffy.
 Anyway this is a must have season for Buffy fans, it has a lot of action, drama and the best writing of any of the seasons.",4,"[-2.527975089878918, -1.6186451879223698, -1.2362032616476901, -1.01921944756804, -0.9688460930296146]",-0.9688460930296146

6028,"Broken Things to Mend is another delightful contemporary romance from Karey White! The books I've read by her so far celebrate the adventure and fun of very real settings, while sharing the blossoming of romance between very relatable and lovable characters. This series starter is no exception.

The story begins with two broken souls being brought together by a Chinese matchmaker. It was interesting to get a bit of (heartbreaking) back story for the hero, Silas, and to meet him as he's trying to indulge a kind older lady in her odd requests (yes, plural) for transportation to the bus stop in Bend, Oregon.

Then there's the heroine, Celia, who's running from a past and present that haunt her, hoping to find a better future in the small town of Sisters, Oregon. One can't help but root for her in her quest to find a place to truly belong.

Perspectives switch quite a bit at the beginning of the story, which could potentially be disorienting, although it does help give a sense of a larger destiny at play and provide an inside look at the converging of multiple lives.

I really enjoyed all of the characters: the way they slowly open up like new blooms; the way the seasons change from wariness to tender trust; the way they find joy and understanding together. Silas is a quiet, gentle, and loyal soul. Celia is reserved but dedicated and caring. And Silas's aunt, while not without fault, is the perfect friend and nurturing figure for them both.

While there's not a whole lot of suspense and danger in this story, there's a good deal of tension and plenty of questions to keep the story moving along at a steady pace. And, as a girl who calls Oregon home now, I found particular pleasure in following the characters through Sisters and beyond, recognizing some town and landmark names while experiencing some new things.

Broken Things to Mend is touching and heartwarming, while being a little more serious in nature than The Husband Maker series (which I also highly recommend for sweet contemporary romance fans). I felt the ending was resolved a little too quickly, but otherwise I was quite pleased with this story of learning to trust those you love, discovering the perils of judging others, and taking a chance on something wonderful.

5519,"As we'd expect from established mystery authors, A Dangerous Talent is a polished, page-turning novel. The heroine is a likeable young woman, Alix, who fell on hard times when her father went to prison for art forgery. Now she's the classic mystery protagonist, struggling in a new career, making friends and stumbling across potential romance.

I'd give the book just 4 stars because it doesn't have that extra edge that some mysteries have - the depth of character of the earlier Nevada Barr or the perfect pitch of Lisa Scottoline. The heroine's story was plausible, although I can't see why she'd drop out of Harvard in her senior year with the misguided goal of helping her father. I also think she could use a good business coach; it's hard to believe she doesn't know what to charge and how to set up her dealings with a client, such as collecting half her fee up front. If she's been hanging around the art world she would know some ins and outs of art consulting.

Alix's talents are almost too formidable: she can drive a Lamborghini with speed and flair, shoot a gun, detect dangerous gas by smell, sense when something is amiss with a work of art, and of course restore paintings to their fullest glory. She's also attractive and smart.

The best parts of the book were Alix's forays into the art world and the glimpses of Seattle and Santa Fe.  I loved the description of the entry to the Seattle Art Museum, which is very accurate (although I never found the cars scary - they're very high up on the ceiling and probably hollowed out).

The authors handled Alix's relationship with her father extremely well: she was clearly ambivalent while trying to maintain a connection. I liked the moment when Alix realized she understood why someone might be motivated to substitute a forgery for the real thing, although of course she isn't seriously tempted.

Although the authors follow the mystery code of allowing the heroine to get herself out of her own problems, she doesn't really solve a puzzle. We know who and why almost immediately; the suspense comes from watching the protagonist put the pieces together, partly by chance. The romance element was a little thin, adding more humor than love interest.

Bottom line: If you're looking for a well-crafted mystery for escape, this one's above average.",3,"[-1.9570191602165445, -1.642437191346032, -1.1840619404037465, -1.0339917143357265, -0.9694680504629062]",-0.9694680504629062
271,"A wonderfully engaging story of friendship, heartache and second chances.  Sweetest Mistake by Candis Terry is a fun and sexy read and everything I wanted from the Sweet, Texas series!

When Abby Morgan strolls back into town intent on fixing up her parents old house and then moving on with her life, she knows shes going to run into Jackson Wilder, shes just hoping she can keep her distance from her old best friend.  The last thing she wants is for her feelings to show through and for her to get her heart crushedagain.  Easier said than done though.  Jacksons still hot as ever and determined to be in her way.

Jackson has always had a thing for Abby, but has just never been able to admit it.  Hes too afraid of losing his best friend when she rejects him.  But shes back in town and he just cant seem to keep his lips to himself.  Abbys had a rough go of it since she left Sweet and Jackson is trying to help her rediscover herself and forget her jerk-of-an-ex-husband.  The only problem is that he is still very attracted to her and scared to death to let her know it.

While the whole town of Sweet sees that Jackson and Abby belong together, Jackson and Abby just cant seem to get together.  Is their friendship going to stand in the way of a once-in-a-lifetime kind of love?  Maybe a little help from the rest of the Wilder family will help steer them in the right direction

Loved this book!  The Abby and Jacksons story was simply amazing.  Their back story and chemistry made this story such a wonderful and enjoyable read. The setting of Sweet, Texas was delightful, with all the supporting characters that makes this series so much fun to read.  But don't worry, even though its part of a series, this is a great stand-alone read also!  I loved the way that Jacksons ex-wife was portrayed in such a wonderful light and the relationship that developed between Jacksons daughter Izzy and Abby was heartwarming.  Jacksons mom, Jana, and brothers also helped to add a bit of humor to the story.  And of course, I simply couldn't wait for Jackson and Abby to finally find their happy ending!  I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series, Something Sweeter.  Well done Ms. Terry!

With US intelligence ""ad-hocing"" and ""ad libbing"" along the way, Robie and Reel experience the brunt of their adversaries' reactions. With an attempted hit on foreign soil, concentration camp liberation, and presidential level security detail, the action is non-stop and arcs to a wild crescendo.

Baldacci also creates an adversary worthy of both Robie and Reel with more than sufficient back-story to understand the character.

1358,"M. Leighton never disappoints. I've read several novels by her and this is one of her finest examples. It's about social opposites who are attracted like magnets.

Weatherly and Tag, fairly original names. As soon as the story starts, they cross their paths in a paradoxical way as they should have never been fated at all. I love the effect that duty has on Weatherly as it pushes her to try and get free from it in daring to mix with a man supposedly beneath her but oh so bewitching in all other ways. Tag is there to provide an escape that blinds and sears her with glorious, rebellious pleasure.

One of the best things about the way the story develops is that these characters are two strangers to the reader, so their burdens and goals take shape to us at the same time as to each other to reveal secrets that will tear them apart, cruelly, which makes the plot grow in intensity very quickly.
A vineyard and winemaking are a scenery I truly enjoyed, and it's a beautiful stage for all kinds of passion. I found beauty in that, despite their misgivings, Weatherly and Tag cannot resist their feelings for each other. There is an undercurrent of trust and betrayal that turns their misfit relationship into a sharper focus. I really wanted their bond to succeed against social expectations, family pressure and killing secrets. And there's a sensuality on every page that's soft as a petal and as voracious as hunger.

I seem to dread and anticipate the moment when the drama is bound to rear its painful head. And this author knows how to deliver the fatal blows to the heart. When the truth, not all of it easy to foresee, comes out, it has a devastating influence on Tag and Weatherly. I suffered with them, devoured the emotional narrative full of profound pain and loss. So the ending was powerful and restorative for my aching emotions. Even though Strong Enough remains my favourite novel of the series, this is a poignant tale of second chance, the meaning of true love and its conquering strength. No romance reader should miss it.

I think he really does think if Star Firce as family, esp. Riggs. This is my one bone of contention... The author tells us nothing of Marvin at the end. Now... There's no way he's going to go off in one direction and leave that robot to his own intentions. No way! So this was baffling, uncharacteristic, and laid a semblance of falsehood to the story.

191,"An amazingly frank, funny and inspirational autobiography blending humor, confession and inspiration in a charmingly written package.

I was familiar with Craig Ferguson mostly through his late night TV show (and then realized I knew him from Drew Carey). I'd heard his self-deprecating references to his drinking and drug use, and knew he was in recovery, and was aware of his strong patriotic streak after choosing American citizenship. I regularly Tivo his shows, and then watch the monologues over the weekend.

The laughs come early in this book (including in the captions of the obligatory photos). His descriptions of being introduced to Dick Cheney and George Bush at the White House correspondents' dinner are wickedly funny. But this book is more than gags; interspersed with the laughs are places of pathos and sadness that put a lump in my throat as he filled in the pre-Drew Carey blanks with careers as a rock and roll drummer, a electrical parts assembler, an illegal-alien sheetrock hanger, stand-up comedian and actor. He pulls no punches in describing the worst of his drinking and drug use, and avoids sanctimony in discussing his eventual recovery; he is respectful to a fault of the traditions of the original 12-step recovery program...which he doesn't name --so I won't guess- but assures us it can be found near the front of most phone books...

This is eldest sibling and firefighter Luke Almeida, and PR representative Kinsey Taylors storyline.

Told from several third person perspectives, the storyline focuses on saving Lukes public persona.  His most recent antics have landed him on YouTube and in hot water with the Mayors office.  Enter Kinsey Taylor-the woman hired to change the Chicago Fire Departments image and in doing so, tame Luke Almeida. What ensues is a building relationship between two people whose recent histories in the love department has resulted in heartbreak and betrayal. As Kinsey works her magic with both Luke and the CFD, the truth about Lukes volatile blow up goes beyond a simple bar room brawl.

Kinsey is a smart, independent woman who followed the wrong man to Chicago and now finds herself alone without family and friends. Luke, is an alpha male, who puts family first and in this finds himself in the position to defend and protect the people that he loves. As Luke begins to fall for Kinsey, our heroine will pull away when her time in Chicago comes to an end.

We are introduced to all of the Dempsey foster siblings: Beck and his new wife Darcy, the quiet and secretive Wyatt, model-gorgeous Gage and the only female Alexandra. There are a number of  future storylines developing and Kate Meader seamlessly blends the introductions throughout the main premise.  Several secondary and colorful supporting players include the misogynistic Mayor Eli Cooper, who may or may not be interested in the lovely Alex; Chef Brady Smith whose military PTSD has left him scarred both inside and out; as well as several fellow firefighters, city hall employees, and the patrons and regulars at the family owned bar. The Dempsey family has a rocky history with the political elite of Chicago both in the Mayors office and the police department-and the stories are revealing a little bit at a time.

FLIRTING WITH FIRE is a brilliant and captivating introductory storyline. The Dempsey family dynamics prove that one does not need to be related by blood to feel the love and support.  There are moments of intimacy between Luke and Kinsey; as well as shared family secrets, history and memories between Luck, Beck, Gage, Wyatt and Alex.

Set in San Francisco in the mid-1970's, the lives of his characters cross each other and intertwine.  Originally written as a serial in the San Francisco _Chronicle_, it is reminiscent of Dickens: short vignettes with sharply drawn characters, plenty of drama and tension (sexual and otherwise) that frequently leave the reader with  a cliff-hanger at the end of the chapter leaving you hungering for more.

The writing is witty (every few pages I was laughing out loud - much to the chagrin of those sitting around me at the coffee shop where I was reading most of the book), a bit irreverant (sexuality, gender, race and class are all targets of Maupin's pen), and utterly entertaining.

8751,"Once Upon a Power Play is a great addition to Jennifer Bonds Risky Businessseries. Character-driven, the story very much focusses on Chloe and Ryan and considering I haven't been overly impressed with many of the Brazen titles of late, this was a welcome discovery. And whilst the storyline was fairly predictable, this couple had an amazing chemistry, didn't bring a huge amount of drama and created some very sexy heated moments. I couldn't have asked for much more.

""Happily ever after is a fairy tale that's not meant for me.""

The authors writing style works perfect for me. She pulls her reader in from the start and has brought characters with superb personalities. There was nothing I didn't love about Chloe and Ryan, individually or together, and whilst both have their vulnerabilities and insecurities its perfectly balanced with verbal sparring, fun and dirty-talk that actually doesnt leave you cringing.

""Everywhere this ice cube goes, my mouth follows.""

All in all this was a thoroughly enjoyable read that I wouldnt hesitate to recommend if you're looking for a feel-good sexy sports-romance which is low on angst. Heres hoping that Jennifer Bonds has a story in the making for Ryans teammate, Bash as he was a wonderful secondary character who definitely has mileage in him.

2053,"In the first novel Abbott wrote about Sam Capra we learned that he had been set up as the owner of bars in different cities around the world as a front to travel  solving problems for the group that paid for the bars.  In ""Downfall"" a beautiful woman walks into his bar in San Francisco and asks for help from two gunmen pursuing her.  Sam is ex CIA and using his skills helps her but finds that he has dived into the midst of a shadowy group using influence and money to change things around to promote their own interests at the expense of anyone else.  Sam, himself is a member of the group that set him up as a bar owner and finds himself caught between the interests of both groups.
  A super villain named Belias is leader of group one, and decides that he is interested in getting Sam to work for him.  Belias is very well fleshed out and comes across as an individual that through his own intelligence and work has created a world wide organization dedicated to creating opportunities for certain people.  Once availing themselves of Belias' ""gifts"" they then become indebted to him.  Sam runs up against Belias' machinations throughout the book and does pretend to be interested in working with him at a certain point.
  Abbott brings more members of Sam's group into the picture and conflicts between them are introduced.  There is also a brief interlude where the possibility of another group watching proceedings and thinking of acting is brought up certainly for future reference.
  All Jeff Abbott's books provide excellent plot, fast action and characters that grab the reader's interests.

They decided that Sunny needed a man so they each set her up on a blind date. The dates went from bad to worse until Sunny took matters into her own hands.

When Edna sees Jake break into Sunny's neighbor's house and he's got a gun, it gets more serious. But it's still funny with Edna talking about what else he's got in his pants besides the gun. Edna's 90-something so her comments are pretty funny. When the neighbor is missing, Edna is sure Jake killed him (after all, he did have a gun).

165,"The Redbreast is the American debut of Norwegian policeman Harry Hole - there are two earlier volumes which were published in Norway. Harry is the quintessential fictional detective - a loner, problem drinker, jaded, cynical, dogged, persistent and with his own standard of justice - which most of the time coincides with the law. Although this borders on caricature, that doesn't happen in this book. Harry comes across as believable - although at times predictable - although one wonders if this will hold true in the later volumes of the series.

In this book Detective Hole finds himself embroiled in a case of seemingly random but brutal murders which eventually tie back to World War II and Norwegian soldiers fighting for the Nazis on the Eastern Front. Harry also battles current day politics, neo-Nazis, the aftermath of an accidental shooting and his own personal demons while mentoring subordinates, falling in love and taking on a new job. The story-line also jumps back and forth between the present and World War II.

If this sounds confusing - well at times it is - which is a fault of this book. There is a very compelling plot - murder, revenge and betrayal - with a fairly well developed cast of characters, which all gets lost at times among the numerous sub-plots and time frames. That being said, The Redbreast is still an engaging and enjoyable read - just a bit unnecessarily complicated.",3,"[-2.374252562590831, -1.2990854406706078, -0.9738452411970289, -0.9717569311485812, -1.1949827530186705]",-0.9717569311485812

The most exciting sections of this book deal with the new historical knowledge we are gaining from DNA research.  This is particularly interesting when Wade examines the growth of language families and how their development seems to correspond closely with the growth, expansion, and migrations of human societies.

1994,"*I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.

The story grabbed my attention right away in the first few sentences. Its a fast-paced read that blends sexual tension, mystery, the real-life disaster of Katrina, and fantasy elements like wizardry and voodoo gods.

I don't know if Suzanne Johnson had firsthand experience with the devastation caused by Katrina, but it seemed like she did. I thought she did an excellent job of showing the psychological and social factors that contributed to people staying instead of evacuating. The descriptions of the damage done by the levee breaches was excellent. I also appreciated how she showed that it wasn't just people affected by Katrina. Animals were displaced, too.

I thought it was really creative to extend the idea of breaches to the supernatural world. Katrina caused tears in the veil between the Mundane (our) world and what Johnson calls the Beyond. I also enjoyed how Johnson took the time to describe the rituals D.J. performs to make potions, transports, etc. It makes it seem more real.

Royal Street is such an entertaining book. There is a little humor and silliness mixed in, which is helpful given the depressing setting and circumstances. The mysteries about the ritual murders and Gerrys disappearance also kept me glued to the pages. When it all came together, it made sense. There weren't any loose ends. The story was wrapped up very well.

I only have two minor complaints, both of which have to do with overused tropes. One is that D.J. gives her staff a name. The other is that the book has an Alice in Wonderland reference, which is so overused that it is starting to become one of my biggest pet peeves.

I don't think either of those things are worth taking off stars for, because I loved this book as a whole. I thought it was very well written and creative. I give it 5 stars.

The case that Leary and Reeve have to deal with is pretty big and I liked that Bennett was able to draw focus to it when needed, and not bore the reader in the process, yet also pull focus away just as seamlessly so the reader could connect with the characters and watch their budding romance blossom. I think I enjoyed this particular case a bit more because its a medical malpractice case, which, of course, isn't fun, but its nice when you know whats going on and can connect to the subject more.

I think I might just have a favorite in this series after reading this book. Cal and Matt both have their merits, but Reeve is just so amazing through and through, he really won me over in this book. I appreciated his level of maturity and how he handled his relationship with Leary. He is such a good guy overall and he has all the qualities that would make me fall head over heels for him, thats for sure. Leary was also a great character and I admired her tenacity and passion. Shes one of those lawyers who fight for the little person and she does it well. While she did let her emotions get the best of her at times during the story, she shined overall.

With each book I read of Bennetts, I fall more and more in love with her writing and her imagination. She never fails to create such amazing, entertaining, and often times, sinful stories.

I have to say I really enjoyed this book! I love books about single dads and their children and this one was no different.

Simon was the single parent to an absolutely adorable little girl Hayden who hung the moon for him, he hired Abby as her nanny 7 months ago and has felt an undeniable attraction to her from the very beginning. I have to say how much I loved Simon, he wasn't this bada$$ alpha who treated women like they are disposable. He values his daughter too much to that women with anything less than respect.

Simon was a complete sweetheart, he was charming, sweet,  caring, an amazing father who had the body and looks of a greek god. I really liked the fact that he wasn't arrogant, selfish or self absorbed.

Abby was a great leading lady for me, she was a great nanny to Hayden and just a completely likeable character. She didn't cause unnecessary drama and didn't try to make trouble for Simon. Abbys feelings for Simon have been steadily developing since she first started working for him, she tries her best to fight it since she doesnt want to jeprodise her job.

While I really did enjoy this story I felt there were parts of it that were slightly rushed. There was next to no drama at all and everything just kind of skated along.

This book is a bit of a slow build up but you can feel the sexual tension between the characters from the beginning of the book and it keeps getting hotter the further in you get..

Samuel Lake is a Methodist preacher who gets moved around a lot.  So, his daughter, Swan is used to being a preacher's kid and being the new kid in town.  When Samuel is not assigned a new position, the family is forced to move back home to Arkansas with Samuel's mother.

I totally fell into this book and was faced with the dilemma of wanting to reading it quickly and wanting to savor it.  I thought that the characters were well drawn, possibly a smidgen stereotypical, but that only added to the charm.  I had trouble reading parts of it...the cruel treatment of people and animals by one of the characters.  But I've known someone almost exactly like him, and I know people like that exist.

The writing was perfect:

""Add this to the fact that he preached with what some considered undue fervor, frequently thumping the pulpit for emphasis and saying things like ""If you believe that, say 'Amen!'"" when he knew full well that Methodists were trying to give up that sort of thing,""

""Her parents certainly loved God.  Swan did, too, she was sure, even though she ben His rules with some degree of regularity, and prayed only When It Was Important.  She'd never been one to wear God out with small talk.""

I tended to skim over these words in the end. I liked Siena as a character, she grows into a tough young woman and defies her father and the Law that dictates her place in society.

I liked how strong this started but then it slowed a bit and left me a little unsure. I don't normally read stories about older relationships but Im glad I did because I ended up really enjoying it.

I really loved Adrian and Abbeys relationship. She was extremely smart for her age and her attitude was just so infectious. Kat wasn't bad at all. I really liked her friends and the way they interacted whenever they were together.

My only complaint was Kat holding back for as long as she did. I liked how it was eventually laid out but it was concerning leading up to it. I loved the bit of drama we got.

Oh, My Dragon is the third book in the I like Big Dragons series by Lani Lynn Vale and it tells the story of Ian and Wink. I believe to fully understand and appreciate this story, you should read the series in order.

Oh, My Dragon begins with Wink heading home after her long day of work. As she walks into her apartment building, she finds Ian leaning over a dead body near her apartments front door. Wink freaks out and runs, but Ian quickly catches up to her. He puts his hand around her neck to quiet her, since the real killer was still in the building. Wink and Ian soon discover their matching tattoos after their touch and Ian begins to explain that they are fated mates.

Their love story has many twists and turns and is more emotional and less violent than the first two books. I was really looking forward to reading Ians story, as the first two books really built up the fear of Ian. Both Keifer and Nikolai warned their mates to not get too closed to Ian. I couldn't wait to learn more about the dangerous alpha male dragon rider, named Ian. I was a little disappointed as I built him up from what I read, but Ian was so complex and different than I expected. He made me feel emotional and I think that Wink helped Ian in many ways!
Im looking forward to the next in the series!

I absolutely loved this story and the characters that were within this story. I loved that characters from the authors other book The Thing About Love and we got to see what was happening with the main characters from that story.  I loved the suspenseful element of this story and the way that the story kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through the story. There were many twists and turns throughout the story that I did not see coming. The storyline of this story was a definite page turner and I absolutely loved every page of this story.

Sadie Banks has had a string of bad luck in her life and her past is currently coming back to haunt her. Its obvious that Sadie tries to the right thing in life, but circumstances cause her to sometimes do things that she doesnt like. This causes her to feel like she is a bad person despite trying to the right thing.

Jaxson was introduced to readers in the authors other book The Thing About Love and in this book we got to learn more about him. We learnt about the devastation he felt about his engagement to Jules ending and her marrying someone else. We also got to see the hot dominant alpha male that created some incredible hot moments in the story. Jaxson I absoltuly loved reading about and found him to be not only incredible sexy character but also a good guy.

Come a little closer is about Sadie Banks whose life completely change due to circumstances out of her control. This sees her meeting Jaxson who was at the top of his career and sees the good in her. But Sadie thinks she is a bad girl that doesnt deserve love, can the good guy turn her around.

Kim Karr has written an incredible story that flowed all the way through. This story had everything I love in a story, angst, drama, suspense, romance and steamy moments to create an engaging storyline. These two characters are amazing together that had an intense connection between them that resulted in many hot moments.

8183,"Commodore Catherine Kimbridge goes undercover to discover why spaceships of citizens are being captured and stop the culprits. Her nanobot enhancements and loyal mates accompany her through a maze of aliens and into the unknown vastness of space. It is her exceptional skills and wits that stand between death and success.

The strange race of aliens who are responsible for abducting the thousands of humans are not what they seem. They are slavers, but not all of them believe in the ancient ways. When they are faced with their own daemons, it is Catherine who must save not only her own people, but her enemies too.

Catherine rises quickly to a trusted position on the alien ship, almost too quickly. It may be hard for the listener to hold his or her disbelief at the incompetence and simplistic nature of the alien enemies. They don't feel all that scary or threatening. The plot runs along at a fast and linear pace as Catherine continues to save the day. Any suspense that may have developed, seems to be sucked away at her inevitable successes.

There are interesting worlds and universes that they discover along the way. The moral dilemma of the slaver aliens is also interesting along with their evolutionary source. It is a generally entertaining story with several battles and explorations.

The story is performed by L. C. Kane, who does an adequate job. Her voice is easy to listen to and her character voices are fine.

Exploration is a space opera novel, the third in an ongoing series about the adventures of Catherine Kimbridge. It is a discrete novel that doesnt appear to need its predecessor to work; nor does it leave much unresolved that you are looking to read the next for conclusion. It is a straightforward novel that is generally entertaining, without much suspense.

809,"No reader of Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch novels ever doubts that they are well written police procedurals with plenty of peripheral trips into Bosch's life outside the squad room. THE DROP is no exception to Connelly's tried and true formula of mixing generous portions of Harry's day job as a homicide investigator with his personal life as single parent and unattached male.  Although Harry is never consciously looking for love, he seems to have an uncanny knack for stumbling across it in the most unlikely places.

With THE DROP Harry and his partner David Chu become enmeshed in some ""high jingo"", the double-dealing political games that have been making serious inroads in the police department, when they are called upon to investigate both a 20 year old cold case as well as the current death of a city councilman's son.  Questions abound concerning both cases. Did the police mishandle evidence on the cold case?  If not, then why does the blood evidence found at the scene of the crime belong to an eight year old boy? Also, did the councilman's sonny-boy accidentally fall, was he pushed or did he jump to his death?  Never fear, all will be revealed.

Meanwhile, back at the ranch, an aging Bosch maintains his disdain for the LAPD's bureaucracy.  This ultimate rebel, with his lone wolf attitude, is making life difficult for his partner, David Chu, who feels more and more resentful of his position on the ""team"" as he perceives that Bosch is attempting to exclude him from significant parts of the investigation.
While tension builds between the major players, clues for the two cases are gathered and sorted slowly, allowing the narrative to gain momentum in a measured manner while succeeding in keeping the reader mentally and emotionally engaged.

This is a breathlessly riveting read - so much so that after starting it during my morning coffee, I ignored the opening time of my business to finish this in just one sitting!

The touch of paranormal was great (I am so sick of vampires and werewolves) with the inexplicable precognition and the slightly hazy telepathy the main protaganists started to share, perfect for the story though the later complete-sentence communications were a little too precise.

The characters, their behaviour and their motivations are all so believable. The alpha males are all wonderfully alpha and their women strong enough to stand up for themselves and their loved ones. Beth and Zane are great! It's refreshingly realistic to find a secondary character who spends quite a bit of time being very unpleasant but is nevertheless one of the good guys. I had to suspend my disbelief at how  quickly and calmly an important character bounced back from a brutal gang rape without trauma, but the violence is very necessary to the story and the tension and suspense are perfectly balanced by the romance.

While I didn't love this as much as Rachel Ames - I did still enjoy it! It was definitely a very good mystery that, at times, kept you on-the-edge-of-your-seat. It was a little slow for me in spots and there were a lot of characters to keep track of so I didn't get a feel for Allison's character as well as I would have liked.
* Also - this is book 2 and I didn't read book 1 :-( so that may have had something to do with it. I did start liking Allison more and got into the story more during the second half of the book.

All that being said - This was still a very good, action packed suspense. It was certainly enough to keep me reading and wanting to know what was going to happen.

1097,"If you like epic historical novels then this one may well be your thing. It is set in seventh century Britain and brings the so-called 'Dark Ages' vividly to life. It follows Hild (St Hilda of Whitby) as she grows up and develops her gifts as a seer. She is related to King Edwin and he quickly recognises her unique gifts which enable her to predict events and to read the signs in the natural world to assess what is going to happen.

Hild is a girl in an era when the roles of women were circumscribed and she defies convention but learning to fight and kill as well as to heal which scandalises many about her. Her insatiable curiously about everything means she soaks up knowledge from all sources like a sponge and asks questions where others might fear to do so. She is also not afraid of straight talking to the highest in the land.

The book is very well written and the thorough research the author has clearly undertaken doesn't overwhelm the storyline. I found it absorbing reading though I did struggle with some of the names. It is helpful that there is a glossary at the end of the book for unfamiliar words though their meaning is often clear from the context in which they are used.

If you enjoy historical novels that you can really sink into then you will probably enjoy this one as it takes you to a completely unfamiliar era in which Roman Christianity is taking over from Celtic Christianity and worship of nature and earth spirits. This is a long, and at times, quite difficult read but one which it is worthwhile to spend time and effort reading.",3,"[-2.7977752407568652, -1.1336875554324999, -0.9775218942819898, -0.9982673432015672, -1.1607753368644937]",-0.9775218942819898

Kendall Ryan is one of my go to authors. I have read every book she has written. Bait & Switch is unlike any of her other books. It is  way more suspenseful and even a little more darker than we are used to.

Nolan is former military who is now in security. He doesn't do hearts and flowers or relationships. In fact, he is kind of a Dom. He has a roommate that he is in a weird sex only relationship. She is more of a sub, but it is not a strict Master type relationship. To me, they are more just friends who have sex.

Lacey comes into Nolan's life like a hurricane. She is sweet and caring and not sure what to make of Nolan and how he loves his life. She is not trying to judge, but figure out where she fits in and her place in Nolan's life.

There is a HUGE secret that Lacey is hiding. Let me tell you, I didn't see that one coming from a mile away.

Finally, my wrists don't ache every time I make roasted vegetables! The pepper just comes raining out of this grinder. The crank on the top is just perfect -- smooth motion, pleasant sensations, and overall lovely to use.

The pepper looks like it's a little on the coarse side when you first start using it (even when you set it to ""fine"" on the little dial), but closer inspection just reveals that there's a LOT of pepper that gets ground up on every turn. It makes me wonder whether I'm cranking more than I need to because I'm used to using up so much more effort when I grind pepper! But honestly, one full rotation of the crank probably puts out a quarter teaspoon of ground pepper -- maybe a little less, but this baby really cranks out the pepper!

The only thing I'm nervous about is the mechanism for loading it with peppercorns. I'm worried that the little drawer will pop open and spill peppercorns everywhere. It hasn't happened, but I just don't feel secure with its fastening mechanism.

Beware that this is book 2 in a series, so it might do you some good to listen to the first book first. Even thought I believe that Alone No More can stand by itself if need be.

At first I was taken aback, because this book started in the past. With things that we did not know about from book one. I had to double check that I was listening to the correct audiobook. After this initial shock I found myself getting wrapped up in the added story lines.

If you thought that Dark Recollections was missing the back story of Adrian, you will be pleased to know that Alone No More will quench some of that thirst. Not only with Adrians story but the story of several other interesting characters.

I did find it quite oxymoronic that the title is Alone no More and Adrian was alone for the majority of this story. However when people started showing up in his life again the crap hits the fan. As we all know the most dangerous things in the zombie apocalypse are the other survivors.

Philbrook ended the book at the perfect point to make you need to listen to the next in the series, something that I will be doing soon.

James Foster is simply amazing in this series. There is something magical that happens with his performance when he is Adrian talking, I mean writing, in his journal. True chemistry, he creates a real conventionality, a sincere joviality at times and disparity at others.

Now I am not sure how these two got connected, more than likely random fate or coincidence. I will choose fate because an author needs a stellar narrator to bring his vision to light. Even though Foster is a relative newcomer to the narration world, I can not think of another that would give the listener the same experience.

Drummond performs the duties of family liason and encounters a sister who's also a lawyer and won't let the matter rest.  As other victims  turn up via the serial killer, Drummond tries to determine if the killings are random, or might they be connected somehow via the firm where he now finds himself working.  If there is a connection, then what is the motivation?

 This is the fourth book in the Drummond series, and I hope Haig is putting out more, because I'm going to run out sometime soon.  Haig's plots are all nice and tight without too many loose ends that don't seem to fit in the story.  Yet everything that is there seems to belong, nothing overly contrived or too obvious  that you scream ""look behind you"".  Haig's sense of pace is excellent.  He'll keep you turning the page, without making you feel its done too soon, or that  you spent lost time in some detailed explanation that really doesn't pertain to what's going on.  His story lines are not incredibly transparent, yet you  know where you're going (more or less), its just a question of who is actually the bad guy and how many of them are there.  Mostly though, I like the wise  cracking Drummond character.  He has those thought bubbles that probably should remain silent, yet pop into reality at some inopertune moments.  If you  want a good comparison, Nelson DeMille's character John Cory is alot like Sean Drummond.

 Its IS necessary to read the first Drummond book (Secret Sanction) before reading this book.  I won't say any more to avoid spoiling one surprise.

But if they do, they will miss a wonderful storyteller at work. Michael Perry tells the story of a year in his life, one in which his blended family tries to raise chickens and pigs.

Author Michael Perry was new to me with this book, and discovering him reminded me of my first exposure to Thomas Lynch and his book ""The Undertaking."" Both are gifted writers and fantastic storytellers, and both took me from my life and dropped me into theirs. There is a lot of death, both animal and human in ""Coop,"" and yet there is something undeniably life-affirming about the book. ""Coop"" really is a remarkable read, one that I highly recommend. What I recommend more, though, is listening to the audiobook, which is read by the author (and contains a touching song at the end of the book dedicated to the child whose death occurs during the year that makes up the book).",4,"[-1.559537608318804, -1.0905162473070775, -0.9942052619127888, -0.9785279037041472, -0.9796062623696468]",-0.9785279037041472

Mackenzie starts the story with a broken soul, one thats been crushed by the senseless and unbelievable suicide of her sister Willow. That in itself was bad enough, but Mackenzie was the one who found the body of her dead twin.
Through a convoluted series of events, Mackenzie and her young brother are left with strangers whom theyd only met hours earlier after her family had attended a welcoming picnic at her fathers new bosses home.
Mackenzie finds herself in Ryans bed, but not for the reason you think. She got lost and ends up there instead of the room she was supposed to share with Ryans sister.
Both Ryan and Mackenzie are inextricably drawn together. Ryan feels the need to comfort and protect Mac as he calls her. They slowly grow closer and more of Mackenzies past comes to light.
She bears the brunt of the loss of her sibling, everyone around her shuts down, her parents are absent and pay little attention to her. Ryan becomes her entire world.
Their connection and chemistry is a beautiful thing to behold.
Ryan has a piece of himself that is tortured and broken too. They fill in the blanks in each other. There is no angst between these two, but there are outside influences that try to drive them apart. It was heartbreaking to see how horrible girls can be to each other, even in a story.
This was an often sad, poignant tale, filled with desperate loss and a longing to fit in. Mackenzie had to find the strength to stand up for herself in the midst of unrelenting hatred. She channeled her inner twin to do so. Willows words kept her going, even when at times she despaired of her capacity to go on.

Jesse is Retired, but he looks for clues to the murder of a young college woman. Irritating the powers in Paradise, he pursues a predator.

I won't take your time by providing a description of the plot, as you can get this from the Booklist review and from other reader reviews. Rather, to help you decide if Night Heron is a book you'd be interested in reading, I'd like to provide you with what I consider to be its strengths and a few areas that, while not bad, could have been better.

Regarding Night Heron's strengths, Brookes clearly makes modern day China come alive for the reader by creating a strong cinematic sense of  what life in China, and particularly, Beijing is like. I felt that I was right there alongside the book's characters taking in the all various sights, smells and sounds the city and country has to offer. Further, although the detailed plot takes its time to develop, the book ultimately provides the reader with a sufficient amount of twists and turns to make staying with it worthwhile. In addition, Brookes does a credible job in introducing the reader to an interesting cast of primary and secondary characters.

Based on these strengths I enjoyed Night Heron...but I didn't love it.

My enjoyment could have been enhanced had Brookes done the following: moved the plot along at a faster pace; developed his characters so that the reader could have formed more of an emotional attachment to them in order to care more about what happens to them, rather than just getting an understanding of who they are and what they are trying to accomplish; and, while the book had its share of twists and turns, I would have liked to have been made to feel more excited about the outcome of these events.

Overall, while not pefect (but how many books are?), Night Heron is a worthwhile read and Brookes is a writer that deserves spy thriller readers' attention.",3,"[-2.067888491870856, -2.100976565959298, -1.3496112805368368, -0.9787895442260549, -0.9824251160569399]",-0.9787895442260549

This was an interesting read. Definitely complex and lots of details. I will say at the very beginning, I couldn't quite suspend my disbelief that the two agents who were friends with the family and wife who initially was a murder suspect would be working the case.  However, once the novel got going, Tori, Cole, and Max all were great characters, and loved how the case unfolded.  Definitely suspenseful, and lots of intense moments.  All the side characters contributed nicely to the story and how the mystery unfolded in unusual ways.  Lots of moments that made me want to keep turning pages.  That being said, I also had one other qualm (sorry, a bit nit picky here), Cole and Tori seemed to bounce back a little too quickly from one hospital incident.  Seemed at the end that the aches and pains were gone a little too soon??
With all of that, it was also fun to see how they gradually fell for each other and some of the moments that opened their hearts in the stress of their jobs, brought them together.  They were great characters, with some good redeeming qualities that made for a great read.  Perhaps more of a 3.5 because of the doubts and suspending the disbelief, but definitely rounding up for the quality of the mystery and the strength of the main characters thoughts, actions and interactions on the written page.  You definitely could see their thought, and know where they were heading, wondering, and could 'see'/read the story really unfold.

My opinion: A bit dry in places but making me love Lincoln even more. Shows his strengths as a statesman coming from a lack of education and grooming.

Has aspects of it that feel as a fictional read which I loved. Very inviting for the most part. I loved the deeper learning of key people in Lincoln's life, such as Herndon and his cabinet. I think one of the things I found most interesting was how much Mary Todd Lincoln had tried to interject herself into foreign relations. I knew of her ""feedback"" into national issues, but had not heard of foreign affairs.

May be good for someone who has done some basic studying of Lincoln to have a greater appreciation of this great man.

Well researched and documented.

I don't generally read romance novels but I was looking for some light reading after several heavier novels.

The characters are cute and Emma goes through her own typically-Jane Austen inspired bout of pride and prejudice. The novel is a quick read and I had to skim some sections because I could only read so much inner dialogue about how Emma just can't date Lucas because he's Blake's brother. With any romance novel, you need chemistry between the main love interests and it's there but it culminates in a rather sloppy kiss that didn't make me weak in the knees.

Utilizing first person narrative we meet Addison who has been taught to think of himself as so hideous that if people see him they will become enraged and try to kill him.  His own mother keeps him hidden in an isolated area  but when he is eight makes him leave their home rather than tolerate him anymore.  He moves into an underground area in a large city coming out only at night to get food and necessary supplies.  In narrating events and feelings of his existence Addison is shown to be very literate, a keen observer of the things around him and tolerant to a degree beyond understanding of the antipathy shown towards him by anyone meeting him by chance.
  He is a frequent, after hours, visitor of the library and it is there one night that he encounters Gwyneth also a late night visitor who is fleeing from an enemy of hers.
She is the beauty in the story.  They connect and begin meeting and talking.  Addison makes sure that he is not seen and Gwyneth cannot be touched by anyone. Where events take them with their phobias leads to an ending of the book that is not expected but totally logical.

Celeste is trying to start a new life with her young son Spenser.  Her husband, Adam, is addicted to gambling and has become abusive.  While he is in rehab, she finds a new place to live.  When Adam finds out he becomes violent and that leads to the episode in the parking lot.

Little by little, Jake is drawn into Celeste's life.  And Adam is watching.  The suspense builds until things comes to an end on one explosive night.

Also, someone from Jake's life enters the picture with a great twist to the story.

The Rules for Disappearing features teenage Witness Protected ""Meg""who is trying to figure out exactly why her family needs protection, while attempting to navigate through the world of high school at her latest location. As the story unfolds we are slowly introduced to life in Witness Protection and how it affects Meg and her family. There is a mystery surrounding the reason behind their placement which causes frustration and tension between Meg, the ""suits"" (agents), and her parents. They are at their sixth location in less than a year and Meg vows to not get involved with anyone there. However, fellow student Ethan befriends her and soon inches his way into her life.

What I liked most about this book was how it concentrated on much more than just how this situation effected her social life. The multiple uprootings had many negative side effects to everyone in Meg's family and it is portrayed well throughout the novel. The mystery shrouding their relocation is revealed slowly and although the suspense level isn't high, it did keep your interest and make for an entertaining read.",2,"[-2.4504107511172024, -0.9869940742190979, -1.005939214042208, -0.9791521166093873, -1.1588433540549765]",-0.9791521166093873

Review: The Gravity of Us is the fourth book in the Elements series by Brittainy C. Cherry and a complete standalone.  It is not necessary to read the other books in this series, but I do recommend it as its a great series!

The Gravity of US had a different tone than the other three books in the series as it is a slow building romance between Graham Russell and Lucille (Lucy) Palmer. How they met and their connection is a little unconventional, although the storyline and characters drew me in quickly! The story was very emotional and I read late into the night and oh did I cry!

I enjoyed how Graham evolve throughout the story and loved the banter between him and Lucille.

1930,"Set in 1910, Sadie Sillsby is the assistant to the matron of Raystown Home for Orphan and Friendless Children where she herself had lived as a young child.  When she is promoted to Matron, her whole life changes.  Blaine, the man she thought she would marry, dumps her.  Her job is not what she anticipated and she quickly realizes she is in over her head.  Her heart is torn between caring for the orphanage and caring for the orphans.  She is grieving the loss of her relationship with Blaine while she is struggling to handle the financial struggles of the orphanage.

Sadie is only 21 when she is asked to take over as matron. But over the course of a year she matures into a young woman willing to admit her mistakes and make those decisions that will ultimately be the best for everyone.  The questions that remain are has she lost Blaine forever and will she ever find God's true plan for her life?

 A heart-warming story of a young girl's journey into adulthood, ""A Home For My Heart"" by Anne Mateer is a great story of how God works in our lives even when we think we know what we're doing better than He does.  Even though Sadie experiences setbacks, she never turns away from God and continues to seek His guidance.

4281,"THE TRAPPED GIRL by Robert Dugoni is a novel filled with ambiguity, not the least of which is the title itself.

This intriguing psychological thriller begins with a young man, recovering his illegally placed crab traps from Puget Sound, discovering the body of a woman in one of the traps.  Enter Seattle homicide detective Tracy Crosswhite to investigate and ascertain the womans identity and the circumstances of her demise.  The investigation takes Tracy out of her element as well as her jurisdiction and into a juggling act of trying to do her job while keeping the politicos happy.

Dugoni does an outstanding job in guiding as well as misdirecting the reader through this complex maze of a tale that contains as many layers as a head of lettuce.  Peppering the plot is a series of complex and edgy characters, a couple of which you will love to hate, as well as a resolution you will definitely not have anticipated.

While you may recognize a couple of characters from books you've previously read (like the controlling husband) be aware that Robert Dugoni has created a narrative that is nothing like the run of the mill suspense tales youve read before.  This one is an original and lovers of noir will definitely be hooked.",4,"[-2.367093570610444, -1.2806632677635386, -1.2200704049292224, -0.9795022048931654, -0.9974347920616732]",-0.9795022048931654
2068,"""Thirteen Ways of Looking"" by Colum McCann, contains a well-crafted novella followed by three excellent short stories. The titular story is structured in 13 chapters which alternate between the stream-of-consciousness narration of the 82-year old protagonist, Peter J. Quinn Mendelssohn, on the last day of his life, and homicide detectives who are viewing the closed-circuit TV films of that day.

Peter's inner voice is wonderfully rendered. Peter is a bit of a curmudgeon, a bit of a letch, a bit pompous, but always sympathetic, as he relates the aches and atrocities of the physical and mental life of an octogenarian.  McCann describes Mendelssohn as he navigates his morning and then steps out into a snow storm to meet his beloved, but disappointing, son, Elliot. The detectives, following along his day without his thoughts and feelings, must make assumptions and judgments about his actions and those around him.

Just the right number of questions are left unanswered in, ""Thirteen Ways of Looking"".  How DID Elliot turn out the way he did? And what is fated in the end?

""What Time is it Now, Where You Are?""  is perhaps insight into how McCann writes short stories. From the viewpoint of a writer on deadline, we are granted a fascinating gift: a peek into the creative process. Where do story  ideas come from? How are characters generated? What comes first - setting or plot? How much of any story is autobiographical? I enjoyed this revelatory story very much.

In ""Sh'khol"", we meet Rebecca and her deaf and mentally disabled son, Tomas. This taut and suspenseful story unfolds as Rebecca wakes to find Tomas gone, along with his wetsuit, near the sea. In the course of the story we are told the meaning of the word ""sh'khol"". The story is ultimately a mystery about what happens to Tomas, but also about the mystery that our children become to us as they grow up.

""Treaty"" is quite a disturbing story of aging nun, Beverly, who catches a glimpse of a man she calls her ""torturer, abuser, rapist"" being hailed on the TV news as a hero for peace. But Beverly's mind is fading...are her memories truth? What should she do?

4087,"I quickly became hooked on this series of plausible post-apocalyptic novels after reading the first in the series, Frontier Justice. Dr. Bradley has written an insightful series that provides valuable information for life in general as well as being prepared for a crisis. Having served 30 years as a field artilleryman with 13 years overseas including a combat tour in Vietnam, I could relate to the observations and experiences of Deputy Mason Raines who is a true American hero.  In fact, I thoroughly enjoy how well Dr. Bradley has developed each of the main and side characters. The author is extremely knowledgeable about weapons, equipment, and survival skills.  Dr. Bradleys reference to the Thirty Years War reflects a solid knowledge of history.
In this novel, Dr. Bradley begins with a quote by George S. Patton, All men are afraid in battle.  The coward is the one who lets his fear overcome his sense of duty.  He then has an insightful foreword on why soldiers fight and why derogatory nicknames are adopted to dehumanize the enemy.  I taught high school history after my time in the Army, and I always told my students that people join the military for any number of reasons but they fight for their buddy on either side of themselves.
The author presents a much higher degree of coherent governmental organization than could possibly have survived the plague, for example, the dispatch of a team of highly skilled special operators to find Lenny Bruce.
The author provides truisms for life concerning the importance of routine and habits that I could relate to.  For example, while in the field, I tried to wash my head everyday in the morning.
I do, however, have a few minor criticisms.  I was surprised that Leilas memory card had not been destroyed in the EMP blast during  the bombing of Lexington.  I was also surprised that the damage to Lexington had not been greater and that Lenny Bruce was still alive.  But, hey, it is a work of fiction.

Matthew McConaughey, Tye Sheridan, Jacob Lofland all did excellent acting jobs and were very believable in their roles. The movie gave the true feel of riverboat life. Although the action part of the movie happened mostly towards the end, it was worth waiting for the climax.

She was introduced as Griffin Shipley's unofficial ex (I'm calling her that since they were never in an actual relationship but she was his constant, umm, partner in bed for an extended period of time) in Bittersweet, was very much pregnant by Steadfast, and had already given birth by Keepsake. On the other hand, Dave was a constant in all three Brooklyn Bruisers novels--Rookie Move, Hard Hitter, and Pipe Dreams--proving himself a more than reliable teammate and friend to the main characters there. I think it was a stroke of genius to bring these two worlds together. I've been quite curious as to who the father of Zara's baby was and was gobsmacked to not just learn the guy's identity but also that he was an established character from another series.

One of my favorite things about this book had to do with the fact that while Zara and Dave already had the whole sexual chemistry going for them, neither one really knew much about the other. While they got to know one another better, so did we, which I liked because they've been around from the beginning of their respective series and this is the first opportunity I've had to actually know their personal histories. I loved how they built a relationship with each other and how Dave did the same with little Nicole. Can I also say that I adored the support system these two had? Their families and friends were fiercely protective but gave them breathing room as well.

Today, IVF and other similar methods to have a child are commonplace for couples with infertility.  Catriona and James find themselves in the throws of infertility while Diana and Liam are also struggling through infertility as well.  Postpartum depression turns into postpartum psychosis and Catriona and Sebastian are in danger of her own behaviors.  Diana has a baby using a donated egg, but the nightmare of all nightmares occurs when Noah is kidnapped in his stroller while grocery shopping with his mother.  Liam blames Diana for not watching Noah closely enough and allowing the kidnapping to take place.  The paths of the two couples begin to cross in ways neither of them ever dreamed possible.
  I don't want to spoil the book for readers and it would be easy to do if I continue describing the plot.  I really was enthralled with this book and just couldn't wait to get back to reading it.

305,"Positive is a wonderful thrill-ride,full of twists and surprises. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel. My attention was captured right at the beginning.

Finn believes his way of life is perfect; hes never known the world we know since he was born after the zombie outbreak, so he doesnt know what he is missing. Hes sheltered and naive, but that all changes.

The concept of Positive is unique because it focuses on a world twenty years after the outbreak. The world is no less scary or dangerous, just different. What makes it so great, though, is that Finn has no real clue of what the world is like outside of his walled city until he is forced to leave. This contrast makes what he experiences more chilling.

All of the characters in the book were very well developed. I felt like I got to know them well. Finn is likable and grows into a strong man. The villains were equally believable. The evil and depravity were not surprising, yet Wellington still managed to shock me because I was seeing it through Finns eyes.

Every scene in Positive played in my mind like a movie because the details were so clear. The descriptions were vivid without being overly wordy.

The story moves along at a steady pace. It never lulled or got bogged down by too much description or backstory.

I absolutely loved this book. I was moved emotionally by what Finn had to go through. Some parts were terrifying; other parts were heartwrenching.

The ending of the book is satisfying on all levels.

I strongly recommend reading Positive if you like stories about zombies, road pirates, or destroyed cities. I thought those elements were balanced nicely with the character growth the reader gets to see for Finn.

I give Positive 5 stars for intense action, an endearing main character, and a solid, unpredictable, plot that was executed skillfully. I have no complaints. Positive definitely goes on my top ten list of best sci-fi/fantasy books of 2015.

When Jordan left the Marines he got a job with Pierce Securities. But since he's a newbie, he's given the worst assignments.

She has a strong work ethic which is admirable and a sense of adventure I never had. Competing with a man for a job is not that unusual, nor is what happened. That the man was Sean, her secret crush in school adds to the drama.  I loved how Anna rose above the circumstances and carved a place for herself. Sean can be a jerk at times as he feels himself the better man for the job.  Melody stayed true to the age of the participants and characters, and made the job and location so enticing through her use of vivid imagery, the memory of sound and feel and taste,  that I want to go work for Denise and Vincent in their hotel. I certainly want to check it out when I go to New York!

5 stars ***** out of five
Romantic Suspense

I enjoyed this book as it was a different pace than the novels I usually read. This story is about a teenage girl. The actions, words, incidents she gets herself in, her tendency to jump feet first into a situation without thinking things through, seem in characters for her age and position. As such, I found it at times to be very humorous, and delightful. It is well written, with Jenny growing and maturing through time and experience in a reasonable time frame. Love, forgiveness and trust are all a part of life, and we all learn it at some point, some more and sooner than others. Jenny's venture into the farming business adds another dimension to an already full story. There is lots of action, and also lots of characters, but none of that takes away from a great novel.
This book would be a great read for teenage girls as well as those of us that are young at heart. This is the first book I have read of Ada's novels, but am already looking for some of her others. They also sound interesting.

That said, although there is clearly a massive back story to the position that Shanti and Cayan now find themselves in, I felt able to pick up sufficient cues so that my enjoyment as not marred.

And the story?  This was a fast paced, riot of a narrative.  Strong, independent characters with deep and complex relationship ties.  All handled with aplomb.  I found the City's women added a hint of humour to their desperate situation, and that, for me, lifted the story to allow more of a connection.

And the spice - that link between Cayan and Shanti - the strength of their tie?  Compelling and tender, and adds an extra dimension to the story.

And the end? That unexpectedly wrenched a tear or two.  I eagerly await the next instalment.

It is a story of how one small thing can change your life. They accidentally meet and develop strong feelings for each other as those interactions continue. It is not what either expected but before long it is what they want more than anything.

The story moves at a steady pace and you get involved as you hear both of their thoughts about the situation. I prefer stories where do get alternate points of view. It makes me feel closer to the characters.

9508,"Many fans of Perry Mason have watched for the release of each season expectantly, hoping that the momentum stayed with us and the entire series made it to DVD. At last, that is now the case with the last half of Season Nine in release.

I watched Perry Mason as a kid, but I became an entrenched fan during the years that TBS ran the series in the 80s. I saw them round and round, until to this day many of them are like old friends when I view them again on DVD. However, these old friends bring continued surprises, as the DVD sets have the entire show, something that has likely never been true in any syndication of the series.

I never felt that the quality of the acting, mysteries, or production dropped throughout Perry Mason's long run. The final few shows were as entertaining as the first.

As others have mentioned, this set contains the very entertaining dual role episode, with Raymond Burr playing both Mason and the alcoholic merchant marine hired to get Mason into hot water.

Not only have I always been entertained by Perry Mason and his mysteries, but I learned a few things along the way too. Mason was a great role model with his firm stands against those without ethics. I admired that backbone and made sure to grow it myself, and it has served me well over the decades.

We can't thank most of them in person anymore, but regardless my thanks go out to Erle Stanley Gardner, Raymond Burr, Barbara Hale, William Hopper, William Tallman, Ray Collins and the dozens of judges, hundreds of guest stars, and the outstanding writers who brought us so much entertainment for so long, and made these characters our friends.

Carl Morck returning from a fortnight's vacation is eager to get to work. His ex-partner, Hardy, a quadrapalegic since a shooting accident, lives with Carl. He requires round the clock care, but is now saying he had felt movement in his wrist. It might be by the end of this series, that Hardy could become much more functional, or not. It depends upon the author who is quick to provide many twists and turns.

A message in a bottle provides Detective Carl Morck and his team, Assad and Rose, a look into a bizarre case that moves them throughout Denmark trying to put clues in place. In this novel Assad steps up with several important pieces of the investigation that moves them forward. Assad is a Muslim from Syria and is fast becoming a star of Department Q. Rose goes into a snitch which is her won't and her twin sister, Ystra shows up in her place. Quite a crew that Department Q. They quickly earn respect even though Carl has had go-rounds with almost every member of the force. They do not live up to his expectations, and he lets them know that. The bottle has been sitting on a shelf for years, and the message inside has withered due to exposure to sunlight. What can be deciphered is the first word: Help. The rest is nothing but gibberish. Thus the mystery develops.

The novel also tells the story of Mia, a housewife and mother, who lives with her husband who is often missing on some important work. As the novel proceeds it is sometimes difficult to read at a sitting because of the sheer terror we find. A wonderfully written novel. According to Jussi Adler-Olsen's website his 4th and 5th novels have been released

This has been a series I have followed from the very beginning, I came across Chantal's work by accident but since finding her I have been addicted. This book was no different.

We first see Ranger in Arrow and Anna's story where he is a member of The Wild Men MC, an MC that is neither friend or foe of The Wind Dragons MC. I have to say I was on the fence about him before reading this story, I wasn't sure wether I could like him or if he had already set my opinion of him in stone. In saying that he really turned things around in this book.

Ranger struggled to fit into The Wind Dragons family, he always felt like he was standing on the outside looking in instead of being an integral part of the ever expanding family. My heart bled for Ranger at times, I wanted to be able to give him a hug but luckily enough Faye knew just what the broody man needed.

Jo is a cop and is searching for her missing cousin, she doesnt understand the need to involve bikers in the search but in the end realises Ranger is going to be a huge help. I felt a real connection with Jo, I loved her character for Ranger and thought the two played off each other really well!

There were times I couldn't believe how dense Ranger was being especially when it came to Elizabeth. The fact that he couldn't see he was hurting Jo p! ssed me off and I wanted to  give him a good shake.

The fact that we get to see how the other couples lives are going and follow in their relationships is a big plus for me in this series. I have fallen ion love with each character and I really enjoy being kept up to speed with them.

Chantal sure knows how to write about hot a$$ bikers but not every author would be brave enough to tackle a story about a biker and a cop falling in love, Chantal excels in writing stories that many wouldnt think to tackle and pairs couples that society would never think could be together. This is one of the reasons I love her writing, you never know what to expect or what you will get in the end.",3,"[-3.7503354143597734, -2.092953990233795, -1.0193970671371426, -0.9833095538799411, -1.2379716307671507]",-0.9833095538799411

Hawke is an MI-6 type (British Intelligence) who is in deep despair over some things that have practically ruined his life. This tough time is quickly done away with when Prince Charles summons him and asks for his help in solving a mystery involving Lord Mountbatten and a current threat against the Royal Family. H

The plot is non stop. The book has some interesting CIA type characters in the U.S. chasing Al Qaeda/Sword of Allah bad guys while Hawke and his crew chase the bad guys (Muslim terrorists) across a few continents while one main evil guy (Smith) pushes the world to the brink of all out war as he helps mastermind terrorists bombings all over the world.

2029,"3.5 stars---A BUCCANEER AT HEART is the second installment in Stephanie Laurenss THE ADVENTURERS QUARTET Regency-era historical romance series. This is Captain Robert Frobisher, and Aileen Hopkins story line. A BUCCANEER AT HEART is best read as part of the 4 book quartet series as each installment builds upon the information and premise of the previous story line(s).

Told from several third person perspectives A BUCCANEER AT HEART focuses on the search for a number of missing children, women and military officers in Freetown, South Africa presumed to have been kidnapped by a band of European slavers. Commissioned to locate the kidnappers camp Captain Robert Frobisher continues his brothers original mission in the hopes of locating the missing people and uncovering the who, what, and why of the people involved. Enter Aileen Hopkins, a twenty seven year old British citizen hoping to locate her missing brother Lieutenant William Hopkins. What ensues is the building relationship between Aileen and Robert, and the struggle to remain neutral in the face of more kidnappings and missing persons.

The relationship between Aileen and Robert is one of mutual concern but our heroine is determined to search for her missing brother regardless of Roberts warnings, and the potential threats from the slavers themselves.  The romance is slow to build as the first part of the story line follows Robert and Aileen on separate investigations into the missing officers, as the author continues to build up the story behind the slavers, the women and children involved. The $ex scenes are intimate without the use of over the top graphic language or text.

There is a large ensemble cast of secondary and supporting characters including a number of Roberts men, the children and citizens of Freetown, South Africa, the political officials in Britain and Freetown, and a cameo by Roberts brothers Captains Declan (The Ladys Command #1) and Caleb Frobisher  (The Daredevil Snared #3).

A BUCCANEER AT HEART has a little bit of everything: action, mystery, suspense, romance and love. Stephanie Laurenss heroine is strong willed and independent but a woman who is determined to find her brother at any and all costs. The premise is intriguing; the characters are animated and passionate; the romance is fated and heartwarming.",2,"[-1.2379925859331016, -1.5328486804821133, -0.9838369165766186, -1.0183036162405847, -1.2616531271678308]",-0.9838369165766186

Good versus evil, man versus woman, and the future versus the past. In 1974 the Atlanta Police Department is attempting to incorporate women into it's ranks. The good ole boy network which has driven this department for decades will have none of it. However, in the space of six months several police officers have been gunned down in cold blood. Maggie Lawson a somewhat new officer is charged with breaking in brand new rookie Kate Murphy. Maggie's brother Jimmy, and her uncle Terry both longtime cops are determined to get Maggie off the force. Shockingly one night shift Jimmy is wounded by ""The Shooter"", with partner Don being killed. The men of the Atlanta PD become enraged. The kid gloves are coming off, they will allow no rule or policy from stopping them from tracking down ""The Shooter"", and preforming immediate justice done. Maggie and the very raw rookie Kate are teamed up and working the case as if they are detectives. With non stop action, and some incredible twists and turns this story line is pure high octane. Author Karin Slaughter has done it again building a masterpiece by using some colorful and very hard nosed characters. Dialog in this book sizzles. The plot's foundation is set in stone and capable of sustaining a high quality mystery thriller. I really enjoyed every page as they flew by so quickly. I couldn't wait to get to the end to find out what would happened. Then again, I've never read a Karin Slaughter book that hasn't been spectacular. I'd highly rate, and recommend this thriller to anyone who is even just a casual mystery reader. Rest assured the hard core thriller readers will eat this one up quickly. Absolutely five stars out of possible five stars, ""Cop Town"", is a home run just as Henry Aaron hit home run number 715 in 1974. This is a must read.

125,"""The First Four Years"" has a distinctly different tone from the ""Little House"" books, which, despite the hardships of pioneer life, were suffused with the strength, comfort, and security of loving parents.  Pa would play his fiddle, and Ma would sit sewing in the evenings, and all was well.  This book describes the beginning years of Laura and Almanzo Wilder's life together, and it was a difficult period.
  Both Laura and Almanzo suffer from diptheria, a very serious illness at the time.  Laura later gave birth to the couple's second child, a son whose life was so brief that he apparently remained unnamed. After his death, during a period when Laura must have been distraught and inattentive (although this is not spelled out), there is a fire which destroys the house Almanzo has so lovingly and carefully built.
  Their troubles and losses eventually lead to a re-location to the Ozarks in Arkansas, far from Ma and Pa and the family circle of sisters, although that move is outside the scope of the book.

Book Review of Kindling the Moon, the first urban fantasy novel in the Arcadia Bell series.

Point of View: first person
Tense: past
Audience: adult, due to sexual content

In Kindling the Moon, Arcadia (Cady) must find the demon who killed three occultists or her parents, who are believed to have been the murderers, will be turned over to the occult group to which the victims belonged. Cady meets Lon, an Earthbound demon, who helps her track down the demon. The stakes are high for Cady.

Kindling the Moon is a great book for many reasons, mostly because it has something for everyone. For suspense lovers, its fast-paced with a lot of action and danger. For romance lovers, there is the story of Lon and Cadys blooming relationship. For fantasy lovers, it has a unique and complex system of magic. For drama lovers, there is Lons history with his ex-wife and Lons relationship with his son. For animal lovers, Cady has an adorable hedgehog for a pet, named Mr. Piggy.

One of the things I liked the best about this book was how Lon and Cady got to know one another before jumping into bed together. Cady even spent time with and accepted his son. This makes Cady a respectable character in my opinion.

This was my second time reading Kindling the Moon. Theres a big surprise toward the end of the book that wasn't as shocking to me the second time reading it. So, that particular enjoyment factor wasn't present. Still, I was entertained by the book. I don't have any complaints.

If you haven't read the Arcadia Bell series, and you like a mixture of magic, romance, and danger, I recommend giving it a try. Cady and Lon are great characters, mostly because they're good people who want to do the right thing. Yes, she thinks his horns are sexy, which some people might find strange, but I loved her willingness to accept him as a whole package, even horns and a teenage son.",4,"[-1.032291205607626, -1.4479992741225032, -1.2226736113577572, -0.9851437791772196, -1.1565872617425608]",-0.9851437791772196

As a writer, I sometimes want to convey a certain emotion. After all, it is more interesting to the reader to see something rather than being told that a character is happy or angry. The actions speak a lot louder. This book provides everything from what a person feeling a certain way might be thinking, what their body language is like, to what even the long term effects of certain emotions might be.

If this isn't a tool on your writer's shelf, it probably should be.

I should also add, that this could be a helpful book to have around in a writing class. Especially in a high school setting where students are being taught show vs. tell. When I was a long-term sub in a creative writing class and also a communications class, this would have been a helpful reference guide for students.",4,"[-1.082794930755852, -1.474388378193472, -1.3379097455103788, -0.9852790058599818, -1.29118521742857]",-0.9852790058599818

Really a weird way to start out a crime thriller novel. Author A.E. Howe's first book in his Larry Macklin series has an odd protagonist to say the least. The sheriff of Adams County is Ted Macklin. Ted is Larry's father. Along with his out of shape and unmotivated partner Pete Henley, the bored Larry seems to be just going through the motions day by day. Late one night on patrol the pair come across the body of Mark Kemper laying in a ditch the victim of a really gruesome murder. Kemper 51, seems to be an enigma to this small town. Larry runs into dead end after dead end researching Kemper's past. However Larry does seem to discover a pattern when he discovers Mark was gay and went to high school in Adams back in the 1970's. A recent 70's class reunion has also seemed to be a clue to Kemper's murder. Sheriff Ted also attended the reunion but doesn't see the pattern starting to arise from the late 70's in Adams County. At time I thought this was a pretty good read. Then at times it really frustrated me. The plot twists thrown in to confuse the reader just didn't work . Also I thought the characters needed more substance. The supporting characters didn't support very much. Ted's great dane ""Mauser"" and Larry's inept ability to chat up a girl he has a crush on do seem to get annoying in this tale. Overall I gave, ""November's Past"", three stars out of a possible five stars. Author A.E. Howe has several of these Larry Macklin mysteries.

Jess and Ike work with Jeremy and co. at Hard Ink's tattoo shop. This novella takes place during at the same time as HARD TO LET GO. Ike takes Jess to his cabin to keep her safe while everything else is happening back at Hard Ink. He's attracted to her, yes, but his only goal at the moment is to keep her safe. He has no desire for a relationship, having failed in the worst way possible with a previous one, but he certainly cares for Jess.

I loved how strong Jess was, but more than that, I loved that she wasn't one to put herself first. She weighs her options -- making her levelheaded -- but she certainly isn't selfish. She holds a good grudge though..!

Ike and Jess's chemistry was off the charts; perhaps one of my favorite relationships in this series. They both had their dark pasts and fought like heck to keep them covered -- but sometimes those things just have a way of coming out. They bicker and tease, and were just fun to read.

Often when I read novella length stories, I feel jilted in some way. The story isn't long enough, they fell for one another too quickly... but that's not the case with this one. While yes, all of HARD INK relationships have been quick-to-happen relationships, what I liked most about this one was that Ike and Jess had been playing this song and dance for the last couple of years. The looks, the flirting.. it had all been there. Her body wasn't a secret to Ike, either, as he's the one who did most of her ink. Their feelings had already started to grow, it just took them being thrown together, alone, for the flame to fully burn -- making this fall-in-love story not fall in that 'insta-love' category.

Also, I loved the introduction to the RAVEN RIDERS series. We only meet a few of the members, but already you can tell this is a tightly-knit club {under the watchful mama eye of Bunny (with her refurb-ed cabins for those down on their luck)}.

198,"Alex Dryden is apparently the pseudonym of a journalist with long experience covering Russia--15 years in the country--and security matters. Though it's not clear what the point of the pen name is since his picture is posted online and a set of cover blurbs from Steven Fry, Hugh Laurie and Emma Thompson--all of whom were in Footlights Theater at Cambridge--suggests a certain commonality of background. At any rate, Whoever he is in real life, the author must have felt his non-fiction dispatches were being ignored, because Red to Black is essentially an anti-Putin polemic cast in the guise of a novel. And a pretty good one at that.

Finn is an MI6 agent in Russia with a very useful mole in the government. Anna, the youngest female colonel in the KGB, is offered up as a honey trap. But the two fall in love and over a period of years work to expose The Plan, a long term effort by members of the Russian security services to achieve by more capitalistic and acquisitive means the subversion of Europe that the USSR so spectacularly failed at. Dryden portrays a Russia on the march, using its energy resources to triumph over a recumbent Western Europe. Anyone familiar with Russia's own demographic crisis will find it even harder to take the bear seriously now than we did twenty years ago, but the analysis of why the USSR fell and what Putin and company would like to achieve is lucid and compelling. It's a fair warning, if perhaps an overblown one.",3,"[-1.9813335030651564, -1.6663971421730506, -1.1333781681665396, -0.9867828390068949, -1.2984384702957295]",-0.9867828390068949
9358,"An excellent mini series, The Triangle, brings to the screen the story of an unlikely group of people brought together by a mysterious millionaire wishing to find out more about the Bermuda Triangle.
I started to watch this series with very low expectations and boy was I surprised! The series starts off with a bang, immediately catching the viewer's interest and attention and never letting go. The plot as a whole is excellent! It is so incredibly done that one feels that they have been transported away and are actually present among the characters, seeing what they see, feeling what they feel, sensing what they sense.
On the down side, initially I did not care much for Emily Paterson, the deep ocean resource engineer, though by the end of the series she had become quite likable.
Moreover, Bruce Geller, the Australian professor of meteorology seemed much more like a surfer than a university professor.
Additionally, for someone who just lost his son and daughter-in-law, and found out that his granddaughter is an old woman kidnapped by the Navy, grandpa is taking it pretty calmly (and so is grandma)!
Nevertheless, Lou Diamond Phillips, Sam Neil, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances. Very well written and very well presented, it combines drama, action, and adventure, making it a film guaranteed to provide more than just a few thrills.
The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the special effects, and the music are all wonderful!

581,"After reading numerous reviews of Half the Sky , having many friends who insisted that I read it and have it languish on my wish list, I decided it was past time when I should make the investment of time and money and read the book, which had been causing such a stir.  I chose my time fortuitously as, the documentary was airing on PBS as I was finishing the book.

Half the Sky  deals with many human rights issues which effect the health, life and welfare of women worldwide, from human trafficking to FGM, to fistulas, to rape, to education and neglect of female children's health.  While the truth of the situation presented by Kristof and WuDunn is beyond bleak, we are also presented with success stories and introduced to warriors for causes that cause us to hope that life doesn't have to be so precarious for women and change can be implemented in which women and girls can lift their lives out of despair.

I was impressed watching the PBS broadcast to see the way Nicholas Kristof works.  He asks difficult and pointed questions to gather the information he needs to get a picture of what is happening both in the lives of the individual women and the situation they find themselves in.  Kristof also takes careful notes and this adds authenticity to what is written in the book.

This is an important work which has brought to light the horror of the condition in which many women and children live throughout the world.  And as important it offers a message of hope which has galvanized people to act in ways which will impact their lives for the better.

I am glad that I read this an encourage others to do so as well .",4,"[-1.5676321038834373, -0.9870194919328934, -1.0505306275322013, -1.0188785371348588, -1.0428168117099141]",-0.9870194919328934

And having a novel start with the hero being followed is a sure way of creating suspense. Sarah Ladd's novel tugged at my emotions from the very first line and kept me turning pages until the very end.
While reading this novel, I felt I was in the school, enjoying the many antics, frustrations and exuberance of the young girls who had been placed in the school. The idea of sending young children to a resident school is very foreign to me, yet I relish the idea of the growing friendships that would result in this. The customs of the day, including the fact that a woman unmarried and over the age of 21 was considered a spinster seems unusually harsh in our day when a lot of women choose not to marry until they are older. Sarah, through her story, enlightened me while still entertaining, on what life in England in 1816 would have been like, and what I could have expected to encounter. The lessons that Patience learned, are still valid today.

When a new neighbor moves in, Charley notices strange things.  Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon) is suave and sophisticated and is never seen before sunset.  When some girls start missing, Charley starts to suspect that Jerry might be a vampire.  When he cannot convince anyone else of this, he goes to Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowell).  Peter, at first, is skeptical, like the rest.  But eventually Charley brings him around.

Charley, Amy and Vincent go against Dandridge.  Of course, you know how it has to end.  This film combines comedy with horror to make a fine hybrid.  Roddy McDowell was a great character actor in early days of MGM (best as Liz Taylor's sidekick.)  This was a comeback for McDowell.

Fright Night is a great Halloween film for the preteens up.  It's scary, but with a sense of humor.

2195,"I found this book helpful but it wasn't quite what I was expecting.  There was one paragraph that resonated with me so strongly I'm going to post it on my cupboard so I can read it regularly.  In that paragraph, the author shares her theory about our earthly form:  ""How we view ourselves determines how far we believe we can progress on this spiritual journey.  If we see ourselves as ""less than"" every other woman around, we will hold back and not fully live the life that Christ died to give us.  If we understand that on the outside we express in various ways the brokenness of a fallen world but internally we are being redeemed every single day, it could change everything.""  Isn't that a marvelous thought?  That alone was worth reading the book.

A couple things to note.  First, the book is obviously aimed at women.  Men could get some valuable insight from it, but the target audience is women.  Second, the theology is definitely Christ-focused.  Third, there are no easy answers but the author is very forthright in sharing the struggles she has been through.

The chapters cover topics such as grace, issues of judgment, condemnation & legalism, issues from our past that we still deal with, (moving on from the past with Christ), unforgiveness, forgiveness, temptation, turning your will to God`s will, getting past shame, Christ's sacrifice for us, who we are to God, trusting God when things don't go well, God's love, negative things we believe about ourselves or God, and God's hope.  Each chapter has questions at the end to ask yourself and a prayer.

From the descriptions -- live free of the burdens all women know -- I thought it might be more targeted to things like anxiety, self-image, stress, so it wasn't quite what I was expecting.

5526,"The locale for this book is Seattle. I worked for Boeing and lived in the area for 25 years. Did this color my perception of the book ? Probably. Would I have liked it as much otherwise? probably not. When the author wrote about Pike place market, Aurora bridge, Harborview hospital  it brought back memories of the waterfront, the sights and sounds of the city and of course the low-hanging clouds and what seemed like eternal drizzle. If you didn't know the area would you really care if Blake Sanders drove down Madison or went to volunteer park? I really don't know.

A short synopsis of the story: When Blake Sanders is accused of embezzlement he loses his job and his wife. His son commits suicide . He works at a job delivering papers while dealing with grief and depression. After he is framed for a murder on his paper route he races to clear his name before he is arrested. Throw in a century old mystery, a foreign spy and lost treasure.

The characters are well developed and the story is intriguing  with a good amount of local history added in. I think you will enjoy it even more if you know Seattle.

I don't know why anyone would compare this author to Baldacci. I've read my share of Baldacci and most of his characters don't go beyond knowing how to throw a few punches and round house kicks and aim a bullet between the eyes.  I always got the distinct impression that each chapter ended with ""He said nothing"" or ""He did not answer""  which, I suppose, was to convince you the character was the strong, silent type.

Harley is the daughter of the band's manager Floyd; this fact is not initially known by Dex when he is hostile and makes a very crude remark to her when she meets him for an interview for her entertainment blog.

I won't summarize the story except to say that it takes place over the long life of the narrator who is one of the main characters.  Its a story about family and what family is capable of perpetrating on each other.
Her characters are unique, interesting, and multi-demensional.  The story is complex but logical in its flow.  For the most part, it holds your interest.  My one complaint is the length.  I believe Atwood would have served the story a service by moving it along at a bit of a faster pace.

140,"In his sixth novel, Lehane departs from his popular, edgy, noir PI series featuring the hardboiled Dorchester duo Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro. ""Mystic River"" takes place around the murder of a promising, beautiful Dorchester girl and centers on three men, friends as boys, whose lives intersect again over the murder.
In the 1970's Sean Devine (the more affluent), Jimmy Marcus (the hellion) and Dave Boyle (the hanger-on) spend their Saturdays in the streets together until one day a car stops and two men intimidate Dave into going with them. His abduction and escape change everything.
Twenty-five years later Sean is a Boston homicide cop, Jimmy is a reformed ex-con who owns a neighborhood store and Dave Boyle is still a sad sack, haunted by the shame of his old trauma. The night Jimmy's 19-year-old daughter is murdered Dave commits a bloody crime and the subsequent news of the girl's murder leaves his wife in an increasing state of dread and suspicion. Did her husband murder Jimmy's daughter? Assigned to the murder, Sean finds himself mired in the intimate details of his old friends' lives and dwelling on the past they share.
The murder's aftermath frames the portrait of a close-knit (outsiders unwelcome) community in the throes of anguish. Driven by the expectations of family and friends and his own anger and grief, Jimmy seeks the murderer to mete out his own form of justice while Sean, under the auspices of the state, invades his friend's grief and his family's private moments and Dave, exulting in his cathartic act, tries to maintain a shell of normalcy.
Harsh, tender and painful, beautifully written, ""Mystic River"" explores the psyche of a neighborhood and how the individual is shaped by belonging, exclusion and class. Building to a dark, explosive, fateful climax, it's also an intense, insightful portrait of three men and the inner forces that drive them.",4,"[-3.0554735945224447, -2.3357432870612835, -1.1556243818891685, -0.9896886473452486, -1.0948924282832144]",-0.9896886473452486

This novel comes after Indivisible, and even now, thinking about a novel I read months ago, my adrenaline starts pumping. Since I read the first one first, I can not say if it would have been different if I had not. Although it probably adds depth to the story, I don't think it is necessary to read one before the other. The topics Kristen chooses to write about are not the normal, humdrum everyday life type of topics, and yet they are there.
The main characters, Trevor MacDaniel, and Natalie Reeve are strong people. Trevor is search and rescue and the first page has him fighting a cougar to save a child. But Trevor is vulnerable, and has a hard time when faced with a child's pain. Natalie has a rare mental condition called eidetic memory which causes her to remember more than is good for anyone, and struggles with it and with relationships. I am definitely a pushover for heroes, and since Kristen writes about heroes, she is one of my favorite authors.
The story flows well, though fast, and the only thing I regret is that of turning the last page, reading the last word.

A Yorkshire Christmas is part of the Christmas Around the World series and I enjoyed reading it.

I love reading books about characters that aren't perfect and in A Yorkshire Christmas both the hero and heroine are not perfect and they are trying to forget past mistakes and learn from them.

I loved reading about Christmas in a Yorkshire village, especially since  the heroine Claire is a city girl and the hero Noah lived in the same family sheep farm all his life- it sounds like they have nothing in common but the longer they spend time together the more they are attracted to one another and also discover that they have things in common.

I enjoyed reading about  Claire and Noah and also about Noah's daughter Dani.

8659,I think I liked this one the most.  It was more put together than the other two of this series.  Normally I love Ms. Bolryder's work and hardly ever have issues.  This time it seems to be a bit rushed through the series.  Some things don't have closure.  Some things are touched on but I believe should have been developed more.  Liked Asher from Alpha Contender series.  I had to go back and read it again since I sorta forgot what he was like a little.  LOL.  I really felt for him because he's the full alpha out of them and everything was sorta dropped on him all at once.  His half brothers resented him for a little bit but they came back but he questions their motives because it seems someone always wants or needs something from him.  Being responsible for Laurel all these years gave him something for himself.  He's been in love with her the whole time but thinks he's not capable to be with her or give her what she needs that and the pack promise he made.  Which lets just say that was a cluster of misconceptions.  I thought when that came to light Lucas was very in the right to kick his butt.  Laurel's an alpha female and he finds himself lacking.  She loves him with all her heart but he refuses to think he can be loved for himself or that she really loves him....stupid male.  He's got a low self-esteem if you can believe that.  Just to where she is concerned and anyone else like his brothers.  He just feels unworthy.  Of course he gets a bit of a taste of her and he just can't let her go but he tries really hard.  Of course once Lucas gets a hold of him all bets are off and then someone has the gall to take her from him.  Its on....his alpha power is still cool!  LOL.  Sweet story and I enjoyed it.

The hero was just as nice and devoted to her, but if either of them said, "" we're just friends "", one more time,  I wasn't going to be able to finish the book. The author doesn't play up the paranormal too much,  just enough to make it interesting.  There's no sex scenes or profanity.

This book features her trademark knowledge of these confused years, and for that reason, it is worth reading. The story itself, however, about an epidemic that begins with one girl's seizure and extended hospital stay and continues with accusations about vaccines, a local lake, and everyday pressures is disappointing.

Sarah is afraid of Reid- he's something that she's never experienced before but she finds herself attracted to him against her better judgement.

The standout feature for me is that the remote does not require direct line-of-sight which is great for me as my console is placed in a slightly out of the way position that required me to point my former Xbox remote in an awkward manner to get a response. The other nice feature is the backlit illumination of the buttons that activates for a second when the remote detects motion - just enough time to identify the button you need to press in a darkened room. The remote also earns some style points for its good looking, sleek looks and its rubberized texture provides good grip and feels great in the hands. What I don't care for is the stiff and slow physical response on the d-pad. It takes about a second to trigger a response when you press a directional button which makes fast scrolling in certain situations an excrutiating proposition. Once PDP gets the response and feel of the d-pad sorted out this product becomes a no-brainer recommend.",3,"[-1.6558266955473269, -1.000623327264606, -0.992631657094398, -1.015129584639858, -1.215664906523292]",-0.992631657094398

408,"I feel about Salman Rushdie's first big book roughly the same way I feel about Indian food.  The food features a fascinating melange of spices, smells and textures, but I have no desire to consume it.  Nor do I particularly comprehend the attraction of the cuisine of a dirt poor Third World country with more dietary taboos than you can shake a sitar at and, while heavy spicing is a perfectly logical substitute for substance, at the end of the meal one longs to ask: ""Where's the beef?"".  Similarly,  in his novel, Rushdie combines his signature Magical Realist style and the actual historical background of India since Independence with the family history of the Sinai's to create a bewildering mess of a novel that is heavy on Bombay slang.  The language is pungent but indecipherable and the story is ambitious but confusing.  The linguistic pyrotechnics and luxuriant prose have displaced the meat of the story.
I actually believe that India offers  a unique opportunity to the author of today.  With the end of the Cold War and peace in the Middle East, South Africa and Northern Ireland, many of the settings that offered built in tension have disappeared.  India, however, remains a corrupt political state, is rife with ethnic tension and is nearly at war with both Pakistan and China.  There are so many latent plot lines that it would seem an irresistible setting and I very much enjoyed books like Rohinton Mistry's  Such a Long Journey and Vikram Seth's A Suitable Boy (1993).  But, both are much more traditional, Western-style novels.  As is usually the case, the injection of magical realism into Rushdie's story ends up detracting from his tale rather than enhancing it.  The effort to create an Indian, or postcolonial, style did not work for me; a straightforward narrative, stripped of hocus pocus gimmickry, would have been much more enjoyable.

How can you not be popular with ""The Hands"" for a nickname? A well-deserved nickname--on and off the field.

Jillian, PR point person for the Renegades, is the object of Jones' flirty behavior.  Jillian knows all too well not to get caught up in the flash of the players and all their antics.  She's the consummate professional when it comes to her job.  One she takes seriously, and isn't going to mess it up getting involved w/the ladies man that is Jones.  But after a few financial mishaps, Jones is all about rehabbing his image, and Jillian is just the right person to help him succeed.

While Lorelei tries to figure that one out, she also realizes that a fellow classmate is stalking her. But that's just the beginning.

Lorelei and her friends are fantastic characters. In fact, all of the characters are convincing and real. The teens act like teens -- with a little more freedom than I recall at that age, but given what you learn about them later that actually becomes understandable.

Leigh Weston is such a likable character. She is a nurse who has moved back to her home town and into the old family home on the lake. She has had a harrowing experience with a former patient and needs the comfort of home and family to heal.

The mystery starts when, during a routine diving exercise by the local homicide detectives, they find a body in the bottom of the lake that happens to be the one Leigh lives on. It's a strange murder and they have no idea who this victim is or how he ended up in the lake. Through a series of chance situations, Leigh finds herself back in danger from someone unknown and it brings all the horror of her past to the forefront again.

Ryan Parker is one of the detectives and he has known Leigh her whole life. He was friends with Leigh's brother and was warned off of Leigh from a very young age never to try to date her. He did the same with all his friends as he was protective of his sister. So despite his serious feelings for her, he never let her know. Being put together during this investigation and, having to protect Leigh from an unknown assailant, brings the feelings for both of them to the surface.

I really liked the story because I was never sure who the guilty party was until it was revealed. That's the sign of a great mystery, in my opinion. I don't want to figure it out too quickly on my own. I loved the characters, the story, and how it all came together. I'm looking forward to the next book in this series and highly recommend you read this book! I give this book 5 out of 5 stars.

8596,"Although Cal is totally sexy, with a rockin' body, he knows what he wants in bed and out of it, but he's just not as ""alpha"" as I expect him to be. He needs to be a little bit...more. His relationship with Macy is sex only and he wants more. He wants a monogamous dating relationship. Being monogamous is pushing it for Macy. Her life is full of one night stands only. She can do monogamous but she doesn't date. Her issues make her think she doesn't deserve or isn't worthy of that kind of relationship but the closer she gets with Cal, the more she wants to give it a try. Awesome cliffhanger ending! I'm waiting on pins and needles to find out exactly what is in Macy's past that has affected her entire life so harshly. Can't wait for book three!

2104,"What a lovely read! Perfect for your beach or summer reading list.

Anna is stuck in a dead-end job in her little home town managing the Value Lodge despite her excellent credentials and degree in hospitality. She has returned home to be with her grandmother after her grandfather's death. Her grandparents raised her, after her own parents went down a sad road of drug addiction and alcoholism.  She wants to make sure her grandmother is settled, but she feels so stuck in her job.

After making a stand for the betterment of the lodge, she is let go. Suddenly, the decision to do something else is made for her. Through a series of situations, she finds out about a wonderful new hotel that is opening in New York City. She is able to get an interview for the manager's position and is very hopeful.

While in New York, she runs into a childhood friend, Sean. He was older than her growing up but she always liked him and they hit it off doing touristy things in the city.  Unfortunately, circumstances make it impossible for them to take their friendship any farther.

I really liked the concept of this book. I found the hospitality information so fun and learned there's a lot that goes into making our stay at a hotel pleasant. I also loved the story line and the characters were so likeable. My favorite part was the huge surprise and twist at the end of the story. Don't you love when that happens? Melody Carlson has done it again and given us a wonderful story full of people we care about and a story we want to read. I give this book 5 out of 5 stars.

8897,"Though part of a legacy of time-traveling sisters, Lilia Sinclair is planted firmly in twenty-first-century Edinburgh. Her grannys matchmaking with thirteenth-century Highlanders isn't about to lure her into the past, especially as ancient Scotland enters troubled times. After all, Lilia is blessedor cursedwith dire prophetic visions. To protect herself, shes put up an icy emotional wall no man could crossuntil a pair of gorgeous, rippling arms breaks right through.

Graham MacTavish is pure trouble. Once the dragon bound to Loch Ness, hes transformed into a philanderer of the first order. In fact, because of his dalliances with other mens wives, a rival clan wants his head on a pike. Before he provokes an all-out war, Graham is banished to the twenty-first century, where he must win Lilias handor return to die. But after meeting a lass as fierce as any Highland warrior, Graham knows one thing: life with Lilia, in any century, is a fate to embrace.

Review:

In this final installment of this series we get to know the final Sinclair sister Lilia.  She is paired with our favorite dragon transformed back into man, Graham.

Graham is quite the philanderer and he has finally pushed it too far and is banished.  Lilia's grandmother and sister send Graham to the twenty-first century to help Lilia since her guardian is dying and they have a premonition that Graham and Lilia are meant to be together.

The story that ensues is an exciting and entertaining time-travel romance.  I liked that the story was written in a style that grabbed my attention and kept me reading.  I loved the witty dialogue, that had me laughing at times.  The inclusion of LARP-ing and the intro to twenty-first century sex toys was fun to read. The gamut of emotions running through the story, I was sad when Lilia's guardian dies but the ending leaves you happy and was very satisfying in it's wrap up of the series.  Of course, the story has is spicy, sexy elements too.  Lilia and Graham are very sexy together and the chemistry is off the charts.  I am sad to see this series go, but like I said the wrap up at the end is well-done and will leave you happy.

While reading this, one does feel as if ""You are there"". The writing is that good. My only fault is that at times, especially in the middle of the book, the first person sources/narratives became, (at least to me), somewhat repetitive. On the other hand, and what I felt is one of the major strengths of this book, is the author's fearlessness in crtiquing/second guessing military, political and strategic decisions made by some of the ""giants"" of the 20th Century and which today we make take for granted as have being the ""right"" ones. Other reviews have listed many of these including Market Garden, not winning the war in 1944, Stalin's motives, culture and casualties and how J.C.H. Lee kept his job.

2244,"Heather Blanton is a new author to me, and a very good one at that. Reading A Lady in Defiance was like going back in time to the days when I watched ""Westerns"" on black and white television with my family. Those were good old days! During that era people watched those programs without concern for the outlaws, drunks, gunfights and loose women with low-cut gowns and heavy makeup. They were just good old television shows that we all knew were not indicative of our lives. They were entertainment! We didn't take them seriously. At the same time, reading Heather's book left me with those same feelings of past Westerns.

Varied characters created a depth of humanity and acceptance of the differences in individuals. All types of characters were represented in honest and down-to-earth techniques. This novel is very descriptive and incited many emotions as the story moved along, at a fast pace with no room for boredom.

I enjoyed all aspects of this novel. There is an earthy, authentic, coarseness to the community of Defiance. This is definitely a good versus evil kind of book that kept my attention right through to the end. I highly recommend A Lady in Defiance, and look forward to the sequel!

647,"So now I finally know why Jack Reacher is a loner. Out there in the world with a toothbrush, a military pension and some cash to buy new clothes that he wears for a short time. This book explains how the famous Jack Reacher got there and it's a wild ride of a plot.

Jack Reacher is sent to a small town where a woman has been killed in a gruesome manner. Did someone on the local Army base commit the crime? Who is trying to cover up the crime? Reacher has to deal with the Pentagon and its bureaucracy and deal with a good looking sheriff (surprise, surprise, huh?) in the town that Reacher is not sure he can trust at first, but later? Well.....let's just say they trust each other a lot and when that midnight train goes through town? Well, I'll let you read the steamy scenes (and there is more than one midnight train going through town).

The plot is solid for most of the book. Additional people are found dead and previous cases now appear to link with current cases, but can he trust the sheriff who was a Marine herself? What is she hiding? There were moments that I loved this book, but then there were moments that I thought the book went awry (i.e. the local country bums who carried guns and acted like soldiers was a bit silly in my opinion) and the reasons for Reacher finally leaving the military are still not quite clicking with me.

This is a standalone novel.

Jake Sharp is ex-military and his latest assignment is to shadow Camille Logan.

Camille is the daughter of a business tycoon who has made as many enemies as he has cash. And now there is a mark on Camille's head. At first Jake is put off by his latest assignment and is convinced that he'll be nothing more then a glorified babysitter for a spoiled rich kid. What he finds, is that he could not be more wrong.

Camille is fierce, independent and head strong. And she's just as thrilled as Jake to have someone watching over her every move. So thrilled that she tries to run out on him more than once. The more time they spend together, the more they both realize that their 'relationship' is slowly turning into so much more. When Jake goes digging to try and find the threat that wants Camille dead, her father pulls him off the case. But Jake's instincts tell him to stay close, he vows to himself that he will not let harm come her way.

Can he really keep his promise? Jake has a past of his own too that threatens to rip them apart. Will his love ever be enough for someone like Camille?

Since both of them have troubled pasts, it seems to be the better route f they are just friends. They become fast friends who spend all of their free time together.

She has a limited support system and is used to taking care of things on her own. She is selfless and goes out of her way to help others.

Finn O'Riley is a busy bar owner just trying to keep it going. He is handsome and charismatic, but he works all the time at the expense of a real social life or fun. He does have a brother and a quirky group of friends that support him. It was easy to tell he is one of those closed off hotties that was just waiting for inspiration to show off his passion and heart. He was hot, sweet, thoughtful, and charming.

They develop a mutual attraction and flirty banter. Pru just wants Finn to be happy, but she has a big secret. And that secret could have a negative effect on Finn.

I liked all of the crazy side characters: his friends, Archer, Spencer, Elle, Willa, Haley, and his brother, Sean. I was also drawn to her protective boss, Jake, with his own issues and intense personality. And Thor is her mighty little dog that really came alive in the pages and took over all of his scenes.

I liked Finn and Pru together. They were compatible and had good chemistry. She brings Finn some balance, fun, and gets him to live a little. She finds that she wants to really belong somewhere. But the more attached he gets, the more her secret weighs on her and makes her hold back. She's always been alone and this could be a way to not only lose a man that  has come to mean more to her, but also her new group of wacky and supportive friends. She does not hold out much hope that Finn would forgive her lie of omission.

This is the first of the new Heartbreaker Bay series with a whole cast of quirky, fun, and interesting, single characters.

She did not feel like she missed out on anything in her childhood, but still, when she receives a picture frame from her brother with the inscription Best of Times it hits her that she has not experienced anything like he has in her life and she decides to spend the last summer before university with her newly re-married father, his wife Heidi and their newborn baby Thisbe, who live in Colby, a small town right by the beach. She hopes this will give her an opportunity to bond with her father but hes constantly working on writing his book and she even starts to feel for Heidi who has to deal with a very loud and colicky baby all by herself. She finds herself suddenly willing to help Heidi out by accepting a job in her boutique, and there she meets Maggie, Leah and Esther. Slowly friendships begin to form, something she does not have a lot of experience with. After finishing her job in the boutique and spending time with her new friends, she usually wanders the rest of the night around town, being an insomniac and all. At night she meets up with another insomniac, a great guy named Eli. When they realise Eli did a lot of things Auden missed out on while growing up, they set out on different quests, allowing her a second chance at experiencing a normal childhood. I really, really loved the book, every single one of the characters, the setting, and the messages hidden inside.. about the debate whether people can change, about balance in life, about experiencing new things and especially, not giving up.

2476,"Catherine Gayle surprised me with DELAY OF GAME.  She put two characters together, two that I would never imagine together, and made the romance real, honest and, quite frankly, not very easy most of the time.  But what Cam and Sara had worked together, despite what he may not say or how Sara acts, what they have with each other proves that opposites do attract (and attract they do).

Sara and Cam may be an unlikely couple, but with each and every page these two are together, readers get the pleasure of following them as they ""fit"" together.  Their relationship is not about sex.  Cam makes that pretty clear early on in their relationship.  These two truly understand the other and their very different personalities tone down (in Cam's case with Sara) the other.

There is a lot of emotional drama that surrounds Cam and Sara, but that drama generally is really about the two of them, but the things happening around them.  But what that drama provides is the perfect backdrop for Sara and Cam to develop their relationship.  There's a lot of sass, a lot of dirty talk about women's shoes, but there is also a lot of one big, strong man revealing his soft squishy center to the woman he wants for the rest of his life.  It's hard not to love these two together, even when Sara fights what's happening.

For those that follow the series....a little Katie and Babs update.  We see both characters, but not together.  HOWEVER, there is a fabulous scene with Babs in the locker room that gives us a glimpse of the man he is growing into.  Makes me want to beg Catherine to give us their story sooner rather than later.

Another fabulous entry into the series.  If you love sports romances (especially hockey) you definitely need to acquaint yourself with the members of the Portland Storm.  They are the perfect mix of hot ass men, sexual chemistry and emotion to have you begging for the next book.",3,"[-2.625918354121776, -1.8103471690640491, -1.0230955258140129, -0.9962218177202081, -1.3458561584841053]",-0.9962218177202081

Shane Develen is from a blue-collar family in New Jersey. He is a sergeant in the Army. Brooke Ellstein is a politicians daughter and is heading up the governors Support Our Troops pen-pal initiative. She meets Shane via mail when she chooses him to be her pen-pal and he responds. Brooke is a middle school teacher and LOVES her job. Shane loves his job, too. He is stationed in Afghanistan and they exchange letters for a year. Shane is coming home for a break between tours, so Brooke decides to surprise him by being at the airport when he arrives. He is definitely surprised and pleased that she is there. There is definitely instant physical attraction between the two, which is enhanced by an already existing friendship that has developed during their correspondence.

The romance between Shane and Brooke is full of angst for many reasons. The difference in social background is a huge hurdle for Shane. Brooke has serious trust issues  especially after pictures that she sent to Shane (by his request) found their way to Facebook. Shane had said from the beginning that he did not want a relationship. Brooke tried to function in the friend-zone for a long time, but her feelings for Shane made that near impossible. Add a few war injuries and PTSD to the mix and its a wonder that there can be a romance at all. Brooke was very persistent and patient when dealing with Shane and his insecurities. She never gave up. I loved that about her.

I found this book to be very enlightening, and I appreciated the fact that it addressed the issue of cyber-bullying and really showed how wide-spread and destructive it can be. It pointed out the dangers of social media when used irresponsibly. It definitely gives you something to think about.

Wendy S. Marcus has written an interesting, page-turning romance with a different twist. I enjoyed it very much, and definitely recommend!

I loved Belle Aurora's Friend-Zone series so I expected good things from this book. While I can't say I loved it like I did her others it was definitely a good book and worth the read.

Mia is a socially awkward, inexperienced woman who hires her brothers best friend as an escort. I really enjoyed Mia's character, even though she was conscious about her weight and was awkward around men I felt like she never really whined about anything. I loved the fact that she stood up for herself and even though it broke her heart that Matt was an escort she still didn't rhyme at him to give it up.

Matt was a different kettle of fish, I really did like him but at some points he was a real pain in the butt, to me he was a bit selfish at times. Matt was great at his job but a little slow on the relationship front.

I really enjoyed the dynamic of Mia and Matt's relationship, I loved their banter and the way they were so completely enamoured with each other.

This book had some really good humour and gave me a few giggles. I wasn't so fond on Matt's pov at times since it went into details that I felt took away from the story.

She was ravaged, beaten and left for dead by the two lords when at the age of 14, her father, Lord Devon had given her to Lord Clayton in a barter to redeem his chits and keep his prized possessions. And she had the nerve to escape.
Her grandmother took her away from the area and Cara became a resourceful and independent woman who was not only a survivor, but a force to be reckoned with as she could easily take care of herself. Seven years later. Upon her father's (accidental) death. An Egyptian Asp had managed to get into his third-floor bedroom in London.

Her search becomes expedient in nature when several of the young debutante's, (of which Cara herself would have been before she was damaged), start being murdered, and is tied to the lore of immortality tied to a rare diamond in her father's collection.

To be sure, much of the info in this book will be standard fare for anyone who's familiar with the life coaching industry. However, it's packaged in a way that appeals even to left-brained skeptics like me. The author cites research studies to back up each point. Some of the suggestions were totally new to me, and I thought I was deeply familiar with the field.

Just a few highlights that I enjoyed:

p. 55 - Work with a signature strength. This recommendation makes lots of sense to me. The book includes a link to a long online survey; I took the survey and found it surprisingly accurate. I'm a  little baffled by the authors suggestion to ""use it in a new way each day for a week.""

p. 67: I loved the discussion of Ellen Langer's research with ""senior"" men. Langer asked them to imagine themselves as they'd been 20 years earlier. They improved on physical as well as mental measures.

pp 72-73 - Great discussion of leisure. I really resonated to the notion that we tend to think any non-work activity is worthless. This belief becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

p. 121 - A startling experiment asks people to estimate how ""fortunate"" they would be if they were wounded in a bank robbery.  Great comment about interpretations of Wall Streeters!

p. 139 - Solving small problems can lead to big wins.

p. 163: Add 20 seconds to your day and gain several hours.

So many series place character drama over plot development, and some of this series has done just that, but not so in this installment. Those of you looking for soul mate angst and Quinn drama will be sorely disappointed. Those of you, like me, who love a good plot, an exciting storyline, and a detailed mystery, will love this. The series, and this book, do have one shortcoming though. Riley seems to bounce back and forth from wanting to be only committed to Quinn to wanted to jump any good looking male in the vicinity. While I was a tad irritated with this at first, I'm used to it now, and I don't expect anything less from her. I think Riley is one of the most unique heroines that I've read in any genre. She cares about what goes on around her, she thinks about the consequences before doing anything, and feels very guilty when she messes up. It would be one thing for her to blame her wolf and not be concerned with her infidelity, but that's not the case. She is complex, and she is not perfect. Her raging hormones were once a source of irritation, but now I feel they just add to her depth. I can't wait for the ninth installment in this series, even if it is mostly character based. I've grown to love every character in this series, and I applaud Keri Arthur's ability to create such an engrossing mystery with such fully realized characters. Bound to Shadows will definitely get your blood pumping. It's full of action, mystery, suspense, and of course a large dose of steaminess.

The relationship between Tessa and Marcus is well described, and his confusion about his feelings is both humorous and somewhat sweet.  Of course, the path to true love is never smooth, and this story is no exception.  The question is whether they find their way back.

8649,"One King's Way is a novella (#6.5) in Samantha Young's contemporary romance series titled: On Dublin Street. I didn't know Ms. Young would be adding to this series beyond the sixth and final installment so I was so happy to see this title pop up!

One King's Way is Craig's story (remember him? the bartender Joss kissed at the bar way back when she was trying to make Braden jealous?). In this book, Craig is a one-night-stand kind of guy who surprisingly feels an instant connection with the heroine: Rain. He's literally sex on a stick and she's the same with the addition of a sweet vulnerability. These two both have strong bonds with their family members, which is admirable but also annoying (let me clarify: Rain is annoying!) as their single-minded protectiveness clearly interferes with any long-term plans. Craig and Rain's attraction is smokin' hot but the relationship is complicated, and I just could not get on board with Rain's seemingly obsession when it came to protecting her sister. Regardless, Ms. Young managed to keep me entertained and engaged in a surprise post-series novella and I love her for that!

If you're a fan of the series then add this novella to your list. If you're a newbie, start at the beginning! Hint: books #1 and #3 are my absolute favorites. Enjoy!

5060,"I'm starting to get a feel for Ms. Reisz's writing and how, well, odd it can be sometimes.

I don't think you can label it simply as erotica. This book, I mean. It is erotica, don't get me wrong, but it's more than that. It's sort of... paranormal? Supernatural?

Anyway, it's not really for the faint of heart. My curiosity beat everything, so I read it but I'm not sure I'd reread this one. I liked it, it just had certain things I wasn't okay with.

So Mona has to save her mom's precious art gallery, The Red. Up to here in debts, she doesn't know what to do. Her mom made her promise to do anything. So when a handsome stranger shows up, telling Mona he will save her gallery from ruin if she does his bidding for an entire year, she says yes.

Their agreement is a strange one. I'm pretty sure I would have said no. I'm just that type. But with Mona having said yes, we embark on a crazy, what-the-eff, LSD-induced ride that we, unlike Mona, haven't signed up for.

Are certain things hot? Yes. Are certain scenes uncomfortable? Oh yeah. Are the reader's limits/boundaries being pushed? You bet. There's actually one scene that was a major nope for me and I hated Malcolm in it and just couldn't wrap my mind around Mona accepting it.

Moving along.

Along the way, you can feel there's maybe a tiny bit of something between the characters, but it has a deadline so yeah, no. Plus, I don't even think the author was banking on giving the reader that many feels. Heartache, joy and such. But of course you're riveted and drawn and so pulled into the story, you just keep on reading, even while widening your eyes, shaking your head or mouthing WTF to yourself.

It's decadent. It's hedonistic. It's pretty intense too. It's a book that erotica readers should definitely give a try. But make sure you're 100% ready for the wild ride because what Mona feels, you feel.

5376,"If there is ever a lesson about judging a book by its cover, this is it.  Both Eric and Corey have been judged on their size and assumptions made about them.  But there is more to them than their size.

Both use food as a defense mechanism but in different ways, which leads them to the same nutrition group and an unlikely friendship starts.  There is more to Eric than his weight but few people actually take the time to look beyond it and see the kind, generous and amazing man.  Eric, though, holds many misconceptions about others as well.  Carey's uneasy relationship with food is impacting on his ability to paint.  Together Eric and Corey balance each other out and support each other through their life changes and understand how powerful their minds actually are.

This thoughtful and thought provoking read reminds us to never judge anyone even when we have walked in their shoes as each of us is unique.  This was a very sweet read.

983,"Jonasson is one of my new favorite authors. His story-telling style is one of a kind. His humor is impeccable. His collage of characters are unusual, dodgy, odd, weird, utterly unpredictable and yet somewhat endearing. The story of 100-year-old man who climbed out the window and disappeared, which could have used a punchier title between us, sticks with you. It's not a feel-good novel so much as it's a funny satire of key parts of world history retold through the eyes of Alan Karlsson, who happens to get involved in it all rather innocently. The book is told in flashbacks - the present time where we follow Alan out of that window and into his new series of adventures, one funnier than the other - and the past starting with Alan's childhood and building up to the present time.
I loved this book. I loved Alan's accounts of having met up and worked for Stalin, Churchill, Truman, General Franco (whoever he was!?!), and so many other notables the funniest of which is Herbert Einstein, the half-brother of Albert Einstein, and Albert's happy-go-lucky approach to all things in life. It really is something of a shock when you meet Alan at 99 years of age and this may be a spoiler but I have to say it, so consider that your warning, when the fox kills the cat and he gets angry for the first time in his life, at 99 years of age did I mention? And soon, within a few hours, realizing that while his mood is driven by revenge until the fox (and much else) gets properly blown up, that revenge isn't really all that great a thing to live for.

I really enjoyed the evolution of Darius and Taylor's relationship. They had so many ups and downs and struggles. I thought they had good character development even though it wasn't super in depth, and I enjoyed learning their history together and their back stories. Darius is such a complicated man and I didn't get all of his choices or motivations behind them right away, but by the end, I totally understood and was a well of emotion when he finally opens up. I really liked Taylor and her strength. She was going through such a hard time and had a lot to work through but I liked her perseverance.

I liked Darius and Taylors chemistry and heat and hotness, and the draw they had to one another, it made their reconnecting pretty instant. More than that though, there was a level of caring there that was super sweet. I liked them but they both frustrated me as they were fighting their feelings, some making me a bit crazy with their back and forth but I love how they got there in the end giving me a great HEA.

The writing is really good, interesting characters and a great storyline. I thought this was a fast paced story, not super in depth but enough to really pull you in. There is a nice added element of intrigue and mystery thats happening as well with Darius and his friends that is continuing throughout the overall story line keeping me guessing. I'm excited to see where that will go. The front half felt slightly drawn out to me but the second half had a great pace.

6687,"Lifes Second Chances is my first read by this writer. It seems to be the first book in The Show Me series. It was a sweet story about two people brought together by friendship that becomes more through the life events.
This story is about Angelina and Alejandro, it is about loss, friendship, adoption, faith, love it is a heart-warming story giving us hope that there are second chances in life if you open up your heart and have faith. The main characters are complex and likable, secondary characters are also great and I can see many books to come in the series.
For me personally the book felt a bit too long and at times too wordy, I do believe the writer wanted to make sure that we follow the story and understand and hear both Angelina and Alejandros sides. At times I also felt that the arguments and disagreements got fixed too fast which I do not think really happens in real life. As it is the writers debut novel, I am sure she will polish her craft and these minor things I struggled with will be issues of the past.
I do think that it is a beautiful story of second chances and it was a nice change to read something clean, most books include profanity or sex so I can imagine the book appealing or being suitable to a wide range of audience.

In Welcome To Forever, Lawson provided for much comic relief and I had an yearning for more of this man. He embodies what I think of when someone says a tall drink of water, what with his rugged exterior and good looks. The bonus with Lawson is in his snarky humor and loyalty. When we catch up with him in Welcome Home Cowboy, hes a man going through something he doesnt know how to deal with and hes in a place of denial. Having suffered a loss, he finds himself cut off from his passion at work. When hes forced into attending a yoga class as a means to help him work through stress, he gets something he never expects.

Julie is just trying to get by. She doesnt have a steady job but in trying to take an initiative to create a means for herself, shes put right in Lawson's path. Or maybe hes put in hers...either way, these two make magic. Theres reluctance from both sides and yet they seem to be in fated. What she has, her calm and focus is what he needs. What he offers is exactly what will help Julie to move on from her own trauma.

They are a sweet couple, brought together by unusual circumstances. Both worthy of happiness.

1927,"Fluffy and fun, A Change of Fortune is a charming read about days gone by (with a hefty dose of imagination). Not especially deep and not especially believable - but still quite enjoyable. The romance is endearing, the heroines are sassy, the heroes are dashing (and occasionally ""wet blankets"" in the eyes of the heroines, although they can't hold out for long...), the children are cute and open in their observations, and the adventures are rather crazy and certainly interesting. Fans of the humor and romance found in works by Deeane Gist, Lorna Seilstad, Mary Connealy, and Kathleen Y'Barbo should find this debut story to be a memorable addition to Christian fiction.

There are some really fun twists of ""fate"" and ""fortune"" in this book. Hamilton's admiration for Eliza is quite adorable, and Eliza's (and Agatha's) penchant for trouble makes things quite entertaining. Some deeper thoughts try to make their way into the story, and matters of faith are occasionally squeezed in among the mixed-up feelings and outlandish situations, but they aren't really conveyed in a poignant and convincing way. So I see this as more of a clean, light read than an inspiring one.

Turano's style and character types aren't overly new, but fun stories like these with new plots and different circumstances are still in demand. A Change of Fortune, combined with the prequel novella Gentleman of Her Dreams, make a sweet first impression.

5977,"This was a great slow burn contemporary romance that I couldn't put down. I seriously devoured it in just hours and shunned all other activities until I was done. The characters come from totally different worlds but they both have drive and determination. This is a story about second chances and taking what you're dealt and making something from it.

Cole and Summer come from two different worlds. Cole has killer good looks, is an heir and businessman, a first time producer, and movie star. Hes jaded from his gold digger of a soon-to-be ex-wife which is threatening the timing of this project. Summer is from Quincy, Georgia (where the filming is taking place and shes helping with local logistics), has been an outcast all her life, and her good looks and feistiness tend to get her in trouble. It bounces back and forth between the two towns while they prepare for production and we get to see what has made these two the way they are. Once they actually meet in person theres an instant attraction and sexual tension spikes. I loved their banter and those two sure know how to needle each other. They were both fantastic characters (flaws and all) and I loved getting inside their heads.

Despite the gradual build, this book still does a great job of keeping the reader engaged. Its a great feel good book that has that little extra to spice it up. The hilarious dialogue just adds that levity in what could otherwise be a more serious story. Told in dual POVs, its an excellent chance to see what has happened in their pasts to make them who they are. It was great to be able to follow along in their journey of growing, learning, and loving.

Nice fast pace, good segue from one emotion to another--no book long moping here, thankfully. Light on intimacy, good action, silly ocasionally. Prose is okay, not polished. Don't expect erotica or keen personality building or beautiful vistas, but the building romance is tender.

But what Tyler found, instead of a conniving gold digger, was a sweet hard working lady who considered his grandmother, Bette, to be one of her best friends.

Amanda Wright was a beauty salon owner with big dreams. When a handsome guy comes in for a cut one day, she instantly becomes friends with him not knowing he is really Bette's son who plans to get her to move to Texas with him.  Amanda is devastated when she finds out the truth.

Bette had a plan of her own and she had already set it into motion.  She is thrilled when she finds out Amanda and Tyler finally started dating.  But, a secret from the past soon threatens their new relationship.  Now it's up to Bette and Amanda's family to get Amanda to realize Tyler is the perfect man for her.

This is a heartwarming story that will remind you of the power of love and family and that not all secrets are bad.  I really enjoyed this story.  The characters felt real with their goals, values and opinions.  If you like a sweet small town romance, I would recommend this book.

5961,"4.5 stars--THE HARD TRUTH ABOUT SUNSHINE by Sawyer Bennett is not a story of hearts and flowers; nor is it a story about billionaires and beautiful virgins, or temperamental hockey players and the women they love. THE HARD TRUTH ABOUT SUNSHINE focuses on four people who met in a support group for depressed individuals or those suffering with terminal illness. What ensues is a cross country journey where each of our story line characters will come face to face with the realities of life-their own and that of the friends they make along the way.

 Told from first person point of view ( Christopher Barlow ) our narrator is an angry US Marine veteran who lost a leg and part of his hand during a mission in the Middle East. Pissed-off at the world Christopher finds himself choosing a support group or face time in prison as his world continues to spiral out of control. Jillian Martel, the groups optimist and perpetually happy cheerleader is going blind, and suggests a cross country journey as a buffer between the highs and lows;  Barb Stiles hides behind a mask of indifference- an abuse victim who waivers between life and death; and Connor McCann, a seventeen year old boy with terminal cancer who uses the journey to complete his bucket list of things to do before he dies. THE HARD TRUTH ABOUT SUNSHINE is their story; their journey to discover the truth about friendship, love, laughter and loss; an honest look at life and death and everything in between.

Sawyer Bennett looks at the brutality of death, disease, abuse and war. All four of our characters must face the reality that is their lives. Some will lose the battle while others will find his or her happily ever after-for now. The journey opens up a new prospective for Christopher Barlow the potential for a future with new friends but also the possibility of more loss and heartbreak when death comes to call.

THE HARD TRUTH ABOUT SUNSHINE is a story of one mans introspection of his life; of his emotional and physical trauma; and of four peoples developing friendship throughout the miles, the tears, and the adventure of a lifetime.",4,"[-3.4419031635351263, -1.8378834427141557, -1.0895324729276132, -1.0003284921104973, -1.0685790503612163]",-1.0003284921104973
729,"OK, I was also fooled by the blurb - thinking it was a case where a father had been forced into an outrageous ""game"" by some madman.  So yes, I was surprised (and disappointed) when the true nature of the situation became known.  Where to start?

For one, the author freely admits that the main purpose of his writing was to excite, to stimulate, to capture the reader with non-stop action. Besides action, though, you need a coherent, somewhat logical storyline, not one that is rescued through the most impossible/improbable/moronic actions.  In this case, our hero - widowed empathetic loving father doctor - is transported from his kitchen with cute, smartass daughter into the New York Public Library for a galactic ""Contest"" held every 1,000 years. Why aliens from parts unknown choose to use Earth time is never explained (LOL) but let's get on with the show.

Our hero questions his mentor (bald headed, typical alien who speaks perfect English) and learns that sure enough, he must battle six aliens and the LAST GUY/CREATURE remaining wins. Of course he must also save darling daughter.  He is lucky in that (1) Several policemen have been trapped in the building which has been surrounded by a decidedly un-alien electronic barrier, (2) One of the creatures befriends our heros and (3) whenever one of the creatures moves in for the kill they stop, talk, meditate, whatever, giving our hero time to escape.  Oh, and for an added bonus, a huge monster has also been added to the game. Despite the inclusion of a schematic of the place, there is not a shred of coherence in the flow of the action - elevators everywhere, large rooms, big bookshelves, etc.

A side story - secret govt folks figure out that the electronic barrier is from aliens(!!) - interjects itself every now and then.  Of course our hero - who is mightier than Indiana Jones and Superman combined - wins (YEA!!) and escapes but alas, all the evidence is destroyed through bracelet explosions.

Janie had always believed in vampires following an unusual experience at college with her friend Sondra, and made it her ambition to collect as much evidence as she could.  Elias seemed to fit into her category of a vampire and so she set about exposing him.  The interview doesnt go quite to plan when it turns into a date, and her feelings get out of control.  Janie then has a crisis of conscience and cannot go through with the expose, even though her work was justification for Sondra.

2148,"What I Was Doing While You Were Breeding: A Memoir (293 pages) is a tongue-in-cheek travel-cum-dating memoir from Kristin Newman, someone I had never heard of myself, but apparently she is a veteran writer for many TV shows including That 70s Show and How I Met Your Mother. In the Prologue, Newman explains that when TV shows go on summer hiatus, she has lots of time on her hands, and her love for traveling lead her to explore many countries and cultures over the years, and oh yea, she finds herself less retrained (in exploring guys) when traveling overseas as compared to at home. The book covers her travel adventures from 2000 to 2011, when she was in her late twenties and thirties.

Couple of comments: Newman definitely has a knack for telling great stories. Here from her adventures in Moscow: Mishas room was pretty small for four people trying to do terrible things to each other, so Misha took Sasha for a twenty minute tour of the bathroom, leaving me and Aleg to his futon, ha! Even funnier is when Newman describes the security screening she and her friend Astrid have to endure to board an El-Al flight to Tel Aviv: Basically, single women in their thirties are a national security threat to Israel. Why? just read! Newman clearly doesnt take herself too seriously in all of this, and that serves the book well. The book comes across as a travelogue as much as it is a relationship observer (mostly of the foreign kind).

I found myself reading this book from start to finish in no time, as you turn the pages easily and quickly.

6070,"""When I stopped at the door to Nicoles room, I beheld the sort of scene that lit up my ovaries like a pinball machine.""

I think I spent a good part of this reading experience feeling all kinds of hormonal reactions. Ovaries exploding aside, this story really tugged at my heartstrings. I loved the evolution of characters and often felt a pin prick of tears as Zara and Dave interact and bonded. Over the course on two summers Zara and Dave lives are forever changed.

Zara has always been a spitfire and her strong personality always came through loud and clear. But time and motherhood has softened her. As Dave comes back into her life, she has to learn to take chances that go against the very grain of who she is, who she's become. David Beringer is a sexy and surprisingly sensitive man who elicits strong reactions from women (and girls), and Bowen knows exactly how to convey these characteristics. He's also convinced himself he's not at all a family man, but really his family is just small.

Zara and Dave have an electric connection. When they first meet it's very carnal and most definitely a summer fling. Two summers later, with Dave's Vermont vacation, they face the hard reality that they will be forever linked and that brings me to the true star of the story, Nicole. Zara is a great mother and Bowen channels that into this story. The bond Zara has with Nicole is enough to make me weepy, but my heart fluttered as Dave begins to build a relationship with his daughter and comes to realize what's important in life.

There's a reason why Sarina Bowen is one of my favorite authors and definitely #OneClick worthy  . Both her dialogue writing and storytelling is beautiful.

Kathy Reichs has a good reason as to why he Temperance Brennan is so believable as a forensic anthropologist.  It is a career she has practiced for years.  Although this is the latest in a series.  Speaking in Bones can easily be read as a stand-alone.  In this offering Temperance has a lot on her mind.  Hazel Strike, AKA Lucky is an amateur cyber detective who brings Temperance the audio recording of a young girl being terrorized.  Lucky believes the girl is case of Cora Teague, a girl that supposedly went missing three years previously.  But no one her missing to the police.  Temperance begins looking into it by going to the backwoods where the recording and the bones Hazel thinks are Coras were first found.  All she finds are more questions and more bones.  With rumors of Satanic cult and a fanatical Religious sect to deal with Temperance finds danger everywhere she looks. Not to mention the marriage proposal from Ryan, Temperance is having second and third thoughts over accepting.

As always Kathy Reichs Temperance is strong and confident when it comes to her work, but timid in her personal life.  the plot of the story flow smoothly and as a whole moves quickly.  There is one place towards the front of the book that is a bit lengthy with descriptive dialog that  has you working at keeping your eyes open, which is a rarity for Reichs books but I was glad to see the scene to end and move on to more interesting topics.

Sheriff Walt Longmire is about to be a grandfathervery soon.  He has promised his daughter, Cady, that he will be in Philadelphia for the babys birth.  His old friend and former boss, Lucian Connally, asks him for a favor of going with him to an adjacent county and visit a woman whose daughter is missing.  One missing woman leads to secrets, corruption and possible death.

Johnson is the epitome of a story teller.  You are not a viewer; you are a participant.  How does he do it?  He starts by hooking you into the story from the very beginning by his strong voice and the ability to create a very visual sense of place.  He makes you feel and see what he describes.  His inclusion of spiritualism adds to the sense of place, the strength of the character and the story.

Part of that voice is his humor.  Its not situational, but dry and natural.  His dialogue is among the best being written.  Most of it is his characters.  Walt is such an engaging character.  He is truly the long arm of the law and well-liked by his colleagues.  But hes not infallible nor is he superman.  The supporting characters of Henry Standing Bear and Undersheriff Vic Moretti, Lucian and Dog are significant to the story.  Best of all, even the secondary characters are well developed.  None of Johnsons characters are flat or stereotypes.  They all have a part to play in the effectiveness of the story.  Even the weather becomes a character within the story.

Any Other Name is an excellent book. Its filled with tension and breath-catching suspense, but the pacing is perfect with enough pauses in the action for balance.  Johnson is an author who both entertains you and educates you.  Theres not a single wrong step to be found.

2724,"Throughout the 1990s, as various terroristic threats from around the world came to the attention of the White House, at least one military advisor called for the use of drones for intelligence gathering and deployment of missiles.  Richard A. Clarke served under three administrations, and was constantly rebuffed in his efforts to get the use of drones approved.  Opportunities arose to strike known terrorists, including Bin Laden.  The White House, DOD, and CIA all opposed the use of drones--until September 12, 2001, when Predators were deployed against al Qaeda.  Within weeks, the use of drones to kill terrorist became common practice.

In Sting of the Drone, Clarke draws on his background in the military, intelligence, and government to paint a realistic picture of the use of drones, and tell the story of what might happen if the targets of drone warfare go on the offensive.  Told from the perspective of the pilots who remotely fly the drones, the bureaucratic decision makers who call the kills, and the terrorists on the receiving end of the attacks,  Sting of the Drone presents what may be the future of warfare.  Indeed it is already part of the present.

In this novel, Clarke's perspective can easily be read as fully pro-drone.  Through his characters, he points out the benefits of drone warfare, chiefly that the pilots are not in danger of being shot down.  In addition, using surveillance drones, a much clearer picture of the targets can be assembled before deciding on strike.  The drones are also more maneuverable and more cost effective, since they don't have to be designed to carry a pilot along for the ride.

Clarke's story-telling is similarly efficient, without a lot of dead weight.  The dialogue and action are crisp, moving along briskly, so that you don't want to put the book down.  At times, however, that crispness did lead to some choppiness as he shifted scenes or characters.  His descriptions of the drone program and the technology involved was very believable, and the interactions of the military, government, and intelligence communities have the feel of someone who has been there.

Sting of the Drone, while primarily a military action novel, does give a broad view of the use of drones, raising some of the ethical and technological difficulties of using drones.  Clarke informs and argues, but does so without veering of the direction of the story.  Sting of the Drone is a thrill ride of a book.

8878,"The Crepes of Wrath introduces us to the Flip Side Pancake House (isnt that a fun name for a restaurant?) and the small coastal town of Wildwood Cove, as well as a bevy of main and minor characters.  As this is the start of the series, I am curious to see how some of the more vivid characters will come into the spotlight in future books  particularly the gruff chef Ivan who I know has a good story in him. And, of course, you know I have my eye on the budding romance between Marley and Brett

The mystery is well-plotted and kept me guessing. Typical to cozies, the town is full of potential murderers and every time I thought I had it figured out someone else did something suspicious. While the plot was well-constructed, it did slow a bit in several places to allow for Marleys lengthy bouts of introspection. Which I guess shes allowed after her cousin died but sometimes it felt as though we were just rehashing the same emotions. And though I appreciated that she was a fairly realistic amateur sleuth, there were moments when I wanted to holler at the book, THAT WAS IMPORTANT! CALL THE SHERIFF!! Ok and also  the sheriff? Needs to answer his phone more when she does get around to calling. Im just sayin. I hollered at him too, in case you were wondering.

Bottom Line: The Crepes of Wrath by Sarah Fox is cute, action-packed, and engaging. While the main character is quite likable, her actions don't always make sense and her introspection gets a bit repetitive. Still, the town of Wildwood Cove contains a mix of characters who keep the interest level  and the suspect list high. The setting sounds absolutely gorgeous and the authors descriptions from scene to scene make me wish i had the time and money to plan a vacation in Puget Sound. I am looking forward to the next book which I believe comes out in March, and I especially want to know more about Ivan as the series progresses.

Hold Me Until Morning is the second novel in Christina Phillips, Grayson Brothers series.

Paris OConnell was ensconced in Hollywood and her mother intends to keep her there. She beautiful and talented. After ten years of playing a title role in a hit soap opera, Paris needs a break from her very public life, the paparazzi, and her overbearing mother who is also her manager. Shes also tired of being treated as just a pretty face. Needing time to plan her escape from her high profile life so that she can attend university, Paris hides out in her secret mountain cabin with her brothers childhood friend, Cooper Grayson, acting as her body guard.

Cooper works for the family business. Theyre in security, and when his childhood friend, Scott, asks him to act as body guard to his sister while shes on vacation, he promptly takes the job. Cooper is deeply affected by his horrific childhood. He looks like a bad-ass biker, but he is really a devoted family-man and a gentleman. He s a diamond in the rough.

Cooper and Paris have good chemistry, and given their past acquaintance, their rush into a relationship is a little more believable. Secondary characters, Scott and his mother, are marginally developed and used to create some relationship-hurdles for Cooper and Paris.

Although Paris and Cooper try to fight their attraction and maintain a professional relationship, their mutual childhood crush has been reignited, and they quickly succumb to their desires. I loved that Cooper and Paris appreciated each other for the real person and didn't judge each other based on the stereotype of their looks or what the other person did for a living. Based on their own selfish desires, outside forces push and pull on the love birds. Will the cabin hide-away tryst turn into a true love relationship?

This was a quick, fun read. It is part of a series in which each book is a stand-alone, contemporary-romance novella. I would have enjoyed the story more had it been developed further with the addition more plot tension and involvement of the key antagonist (Paris mother). While the plot is fairly predictable, it is still an enjoyable, fast read.",2,"[-2.1637763801309537, -1.0115521407130263, -1.1879656172487407, -1.00265010293676, -1.0963843921307739]",-1.00265010293676

Romance, clean.
Nell is a young woman who is just learning about love, and trying to fit in society.  Her parents meet an untimely death, and Nell goes to live with an Aunt who is very unkind and uncaring.
As she tries to fit into this new life, she finds herself wondering what life will hold for her.
Her cousin, who seems to be a friend to her, is engaged.  As Nell interacts with Matthew, her cousin's fianc, she seems to find hope in the discouraging and sad place she is living.  Pearl, the Matchmaker (although Nell doesn't realize that's who she is) gives Nell hope, and helps her, although she can't find her shop and it seems abandoned and unused, when she tries to find it with Matthew later.  Pearl gives her the hope she needs to be more confident, and start the journey she needs to make the decisions that will bring her to love and a better future.
Nell's character, as she undergoes a transformation in the sad place she has been sent to live, reflects her inner goodness and kindness.  Her HEA is subtle in coming, and the contrast between her, and her cousin in how they deal and interact with others, along with her aunt, was sad for Nell to experience, but clearly defined their outcomes.  Rooting, and hopeful for Nell was obvious, contrasting her with the cousin who showed immaturity and selfishness, although perhaps she was just a girl making mistakes, but definitely no moral compass, made for an interesting read. The HEA wasn't clear, although you could see it start to come.  Nell's kindness to Matthew's mother in her illness, and her inner turmoils as she struggles to stay true to her loyalties to her cousin were worth the read.

It begins with someone shooting an arrow that narrowly misses causing serious harm to Alafair, Dave's adopted daughter, and ramps up from there.

The personification of evil is a persistent theme in the Robicheaux series and few crime writers portray it as well as James Lee Burke. Asa Surrette, a Kansas serial killer, who has followed the Robicheaux party to Montana is at the top of the pack in this novel. But he's not alone. His acolytes--allies as well as foes--include the corrupt rich, crooked cops and a bevy of hirelings.

Though the venue has been moved to Montana, Louisiana and its influence on the primary characters suffuses the novel. A recovering alcoholic and Vietnam vet, Dave is haunted by ghosts of his past which influence his actions in the present. Clete, as good-hearted, vulnerable and prone to bad choices as ever, continues to have Dave's back. Gretchen, a new party to the cast, is a more developed and sympathetic character in this book while I found Alafair a bit more hard-edged than in previous novels.

While this is book four of an established mystery series, I found it easily readable as a standalone novel. It has Ms. Andrews trademark southern setting and strong southern women who have to deal with outlandishly funny predicaments.

The story starts out less than blissfully. BeBe gets bad news from her ex-husbands lawyer, and from there the drama and comedy take off. From runaway pets, goofy construction workers,overly enthusiastic wedding helpers toa fianc photographed with a gorgeous, touchy woman while out of town on business, there is no end of things for Weezie and BeBe to deal with.

Weezie and BeBeare great characters; they're strong, sassy, and charming. The plot is straight forward and well paced making Christmas Bliss a light-hearted read.

2843,"I was really impressed at how easily I slipped back into this world once starting THE OPERATOR. Many times, especially in a series that only has one book so far, and particularly when that first book was read a long time ago, I'll feel lost for good bit while starting the new book. And as I said, that wasn't the case here. There's something just so enjoyable about slipping back into this series and these characters. So kudos to Ms. Harrison.

Peri seemed much more settled this time around. Sure she's on the run, and so much happens in this book it's almost frenetic at times, but Peri seemed to have a much better sense of herself and who she is. Sure there's still a long road ahead and questions to be answered but I felt much more at ease with her this time, allowing me to better enjoy her character and further immerse myself into the story surrounding her. I especially enjoyed the glimpses into her past, the things she's forgotten and the dynamic between her and Silas. There's such a history there, but we're only scratching the surface as of yet, and I can't wait to see how things further develop between the two.

Speaking of scratching the surface, I feel like we're only just starting to see Peri's real skills, and the full depth of the world. Every time I think I have all the rules down and know exactly who the characters are, one of them throws a twist in the game and changes my perspectives. It definitely kept me on my toes!

""""Dark Matter"" delivers another scenario that involves a plot that sets the action in a different and certainly not ordinary setting.
  Jason Dessen is a physics professor at a local university very happily married to Daniela, a woman that he has been in love with since meeting her years ago.  They have a son named Charles who is an adolescent to be proud of.  That Jason turned down a career involved with making brilliant strides in the world of physics in order to marry Daniela when she became pregnant does not enter his mind.
  One evening while preparing for a family meal Jason is called out to have a drink with a long time friend of his.  He leaves the bar shortly after the drink but is stopped at gunpoint by a stranger, taken to a warehouse and put to sleep.  He awakens strapped to a gurney and told by a person he does not know ""welcome back my friend.  He learns that he seemingly is a different Jason Dessen, one who has achieved something so far beyond what he has ever known that he will become world famous.
  Mr Crouch develops a story that should be labeled Science Fiction for want of a better term but involves the reader in a rapid fire journey that is as absorbing as any adventure that has been my pleasure to read.

Hayden Oliver is very accustomed to getting what he wants, professionally and personally. As a very successful property developer, Hayden appears to have life made. He is the type of man all of our mothers warned us about, ladies! Can he really change his hit-it-and-quit-it ways? His best friend and business partner pulls the plug on Haydens frisky escapades with the tenants in his building but that won't stop him from taking a second look at the latest bombshell to move in. His playboy status is definitely not a secret though and could cause turbulence with the gorgeous brunette.

Emery Winters moved to the west coast to start her life over and she doesnt need any distractions. Her independent and feisty attitude is obvious from the start so I was able to connect with her character easily. Emery has learned hard lessons about dating the wrong guys one too many times so she takes the warnings she received about her handsome landlord very seriously.

Hayden isn't put off by Emerys evasive behavior in the slightest. He takes her early morning yoga sessions and vegetarian-diet curveballs with ease. They can be friends and no matter how hard Emery tries to push away, Hayden only pulls her closer. I appreciated that through this friendship, Emery and Hayden change for the better.

The positive impact they have on one another is fantastic, which leads to a lot of personal growth.

1923,"Thought-provoking. Intriguing. Riveting. Siri Mitchell has done it again!

Mitchell does first-person POV brilliantly (as also exemplified in Chateau of Echoes and She Walks in Beauty). But The Messenger has a unique twist - first-person POV for both the hero and the heroine. And it works beautifully!

The American Revolution shakes Hannah Sunderland to the core. A British officer takes over her childhood home. Her new life with extended family - rich, Loyalist slave-owners - challenges her simple way of life as a Quaker. And her twin brother, who had his own reasons for laying aside his pacifist upbringing to fight for the revolutionaries, is suffering in jail.

Enter Jeremiah Jones - a wounded soul with a missing hand who has troubles of his own. And Hannah seems to be the only one who can help him.

Hannah and Jeremiah are wonderful characters to befriend and to watch develop in their understanding and maturity, and their interactions with the complex secondary characters (and each other) provide poignant opportunities for such growth. The setting, centered around the jail, offers a harsh, authentic backdrop to the drama as both of these characters deal with issues of identity, beliefs, and love. The Messenger is a well-told story of a tumultuous time in American history, while still dealing with important, timeless topics.

2908,"Maybelle de Maitenon has a simple plan. She'll seduce a stranger. Once she's lost her virginity, she won't have to worry about any man wanting to hold her, compromise her independence. Then she'll head to Egypt to engage in archeological expeditions--assuming she can find a way to keep her grandmother from going completely nuts with her idea of a school for seduction for London's young bucks. Edmund, sexy Duke of Rutherford, looks like just the thing--and he's got a reputation, so she doesn't have to worry about entanglements. The plan seems perfect.

It seemed like a simple seduction in the garden, but when Edmund realizes he's just deflowered a virgin, everything changes. Things change even more when his mother demands that he do the right thing, marry the girl--even though she's the granddaughter of a famous courtesan and can hardly do his tarnished reputation any good. Still, Maybelle fascinates Edmund. Perhaps if he can enroll in her school, he'll have some great opportunities to explore the attraction without any emotional entanglements. It turns out the one thing he and Maybelle agree upon is that emotional entanglements are bound to destroy their dreams.

Author Delilah Marvelle creates a sparkling debut with MISTRESS OF PLEASURE. Maybelle is charmingly different from the standard Regency/Victorian heroine with her family background and French ancestory. Edmund has everything he needs to be the fantasy hero--wealth, looks, a deep injury that can only be healed by the right woman's love. Marvelle puts the two together, cementing the relationship with sizzling sex and clever scenes within the 'school for scandal.' If anything, a couple of the other 'students' in the school threaten to steal Edmund's thunder. I'll definitely be looking forward to learning how the others make out in their attempts to resolve their own issues.

896,"Katherine by Anya Seton was written in 1954 and is the archetypical medieval Historical Romance. Seton created a work of timeless historical fiction.

The writing style is clear and easy to read. The author uses language and words of the era which need to be looked up to be understood and which add authenticity. Her research is impeccable.

We follow the life of commoner, Katherine Swynford during the late 1300's from her girlhood, first marriage, motherhood and her adultery with, separation from, and eventual marriage with John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster.

The author seamlessly weaves together medieval life, fashions and history. Katherine and John's romance is set against the backdrop of the Courts of Edward III and Richard II, her brother in law Geoffrey Chaucer, Wat Tyler and the Peasant's Revolt and the Hundred Years War.

The characterizations are a bit shallow, especially for John who is fairly two dimensional. I initially found Katherine mature but with the start of her romance her behaviour changes and her moods and actions become erratic. After the destruction of the Savoy Palace, Katherine goes on Pilgrimage to atone for her sins and ends up coming under the influence of Julian of Norwich. I knew nothing of this English mystic and was interested to find she was an actual religious figure in history.

The pace and writing then barrelled on to its conclusion of the marriage of our two protagonists and the story ended quickly.

While I enjoyed Katherine and respect its status as a progenitor of its genre, it wasn't the best historical novel I've read. All in all, a good, not great read.",3,"[-1.6592526675211643, -1.1979155961807884, -1.0609789305005657, -1.0043466728386616, -1.1564136222106518]",-1.0043466728386616

Nineteen months ago, Ben, a Navy SEAL, was overseeing a mission with his best friend, Trent, and the rest of his team. Details were methodically planned, always leaving room for possible variables, but Ben could've never planned for what happened. Now he's the Director of Security at Albany Medical Center and his best friend is gone. As he's currently avoiding being his only company, he's enjoying a drink at the local bar when he intervenes, adding his help as the woman he had been admiring tries to shake an aggressively bold man.

Presley, a nurse, recognizes the sexy Ben right away, purposefully making movements to showcase her ""assets"" for his benefit. Unfortunately, he doesn't recognize her, though as she reminded her friend and fellow nurse, Lucy, a lot of people are employed by the hospital. Though Presley did get, and immensely enjoy, the good night kiss Ben gave her after politely offering to take her home.

Two weeks later, Ben is delighted to run into Presley on the Pediatric floor during his last walk through of the day. He may not have recognized her that night, but he hasn't stopped thinking about her, plus he may have driven by her house a few times in the hopes of being able to visit.

As time goes by, Ben and Presley get to know each other during dates and stolen moments together here and there as their schedules allow. While both are falling fast, they can also see that the other is holding something back, not giving of themselves fully to each other.

Will Ben and Presley be able to share their past hurts with each other, emotionally changing ones that have made them who they are today? Can Ben share the secret he's been carrying about what happened to Trent? Can Presley trust that Ben won't be yet another person to leave her? Will they get their HEA?

One-click now to follow these two people as they find some peace with their pasts and look forward to a future filled with love and happiness. While this book tends to go at a slower pace and doesn't feature any of the usual type of conflicts one expects from a romance story, it does feature deep emotional struggles for both main characters and their fight to overcome them and embrace the love they're meant to have.

Even though I probably would have never chosen this book if it hadn't been a daily deal, I usually don't read books taking place in the 1600's, I completely enjoyed it.

It is the story of Slecna Marketa Pichlerova a bathmaid and the bloodletter's daughter.  I didn't even know that there was such a thing as a bathmaid, which is basically a girl who helps others (mostly men, it seems) bathe.  She prepares their water and washes them, providing other *duties*.  But Marketa is not your everyday average bathmaid, she is the daughter of Zigmund Pichler the barber-surgeon.  She is fascinated by the bloodletting and the science of bloodletting.

When Don Julius, the King's mad bastard son is imprisoned in a castle that overlooks her baths, he falls madly in love with Marketa.

I totally fell into the story.  Loved all the characters, from Annabella, the witch healer, to Jakub Horicicky de Tenepec - the rosy chemist born and raised in Cesky Krumlov.

I enjoyed the story so much that I even read the author's note and found that her inspiration came from a true historical event - the scandalous butchery of the bathmaid Marketa Pichlerova in 1608.",3,"[-2.471274098908667, -1.3600655421323853, -1.0935876358856822, -1.0050344166221106, -1.0823665709076618]",-1.0050344166221106

This would have been a 4 star, maybe 4.5 star read for me had it not been for the PTSD trope...yes, Gideon suffered from it so he couldn't bring himself to fall in love.  Furthermore, that jazz went on way too long.  His angst eventually got on my nerves.  I empathized with him...up to a point and I've had personal experience with it so I DO understand the wretchedness and helplessness of the disorder.  But.  I'm seriously tired of it when it's presented as the reason for the hero being unable to fall in love and marry.  That makes this no different than those unpleasant novels in which the heroine can't bring herself to marry for various and sundry reasons.

Another thing that stuck in my craw was the introduction of a secondary romance that went nowhere.  The author offered a few tidbits and I really became interested in the romance but tidbits were all we got with a little hea tacked on near the end as an afterthought.

The only similarities are that the main characters exist as they do in the movie, but they don't live with the aunts and magic is not quite the focus as it was in the movie.
Now, that said ...
This is one of the best books I've had the opportunity to read. Written in the beautiful prose Alice Hoffman is so well known for, it follows the life of Gillian and Sally as they go on their diverse paths. Sally is the stable widow with two girls in tow. She leaves the aunts in New England, leaving her sad life behind, and moves to a Long Island suburb with her two girls where tries to live a normal life.  Meanwhile, Gillian is a bad girl who is in and out of relationships and in and out of trouble. She finds the awful, abusive Jimmy and eventually kills him accidentally while enroute to visit her sister. Unsure of what to do, she brings him to her sister's house dead in the passenger seat of the car - she thinks stable Sally would know what to do to keep her out of jail. Sally meets the situation with borderline hysteria at first, then the two decide to bury him in Sally's backyard. Gillian moves in with Sally and her girls and tries to forget the body in the back yard. Sally's boring, stable life changes dramatically while Gillian's naughty life changes to a more stable one.  Meanwhile they are haunted by the evil spirit of Jimmy, threatening to destroy the tenuous stability they try to build.
This book is not written in standard chapters - instead it is written in four large sections.  Fortunately there are enough scene breaks in each section that you can put it down and read it in separate sittings.  The thing is, once you're drawn into the story, you won't want to put it down.

Even though this is my first book by this author, I had to go and purchase When the Night Ends just so I could get Tess and Sebastian's story(who are intertwined in this story). Now, before you assume you have to read that book before this one, let me tell you now that you don't. I just did it because I enjoyed Ant and Bree's story so much, I just needed to consume another story by Melissa Toppen.
Even though this is Bree and Ant's story, they meet with Ant starts dating Courtney, one of Bree's BFFs. At the time, they formed a connection that they just shrugged off as friendship, but further into the story that connection would blossom into more. Years later, Bree is a single mother to 5 year old Jack and she is pretty much living for Jack and keeps herself closed off from all else. When Ant stumbles back into her life, she slowly entertains the thought of opening up her life to an old friend.
Anthony ""Ant"" is jobless, living with a friend, and trying to figure out what to do with his life. When he stumbles into Bree, he feels as though his down luck is turning up until outside obstacles start seeping in between them. Add in the fact that these two have had their trust betrayed by people who were meant to protect them and failed, they are both dealing with trust issues, reluctance to open up, and constant guilt on their shoulders.
While this story can be a real tearjerker, I found myself going through a myriad of emotions on Bree and Ant's story. I found that reading their journey was not only worth the trigger situations that they experienced, but worth me purchasing another book from Melissa Toppen. My only complaint is that I want to know what's to become of Courtney. :-)",4,"[-2.561393845590445, -1.73851229316166, -1.350238559742551, -1.0064928360321819, -1.378245704759034]",-1.0064928360321819

1595,"Joy Fielding has been writing for a long time and I became a huge fan after reading her deliciously suspenseful book SEE JANE RUN  That was an amazing literary psychological novel of true suspense.  Since then her books have been hit or miss.  I loved STILL LIFE and HEARTSTOPPER but really didn't like SHADOW CREEK or NOW YOU SEE HER.  I found her style to be turning more mainstream and many novels even took on a Mary Higgins Clark style with one dimensional characters and slight plot lines.

With this new one SOMEONE IS WATCHING Joy Fielding pretty much returns to her true form.  When it comes to the plot she is masterful here with believable twists and turns and suspense that truly will keep the reader breathless.  The characters are another story.,  The main character Bailey Carpenter is well developed and her psychological profile mixed with the great story are what make the novel work.  Other characters can tend to be pretty one dimensional and some conversations are pretty silly.  But from the first truly dramatic scene in the book Fielding turns into an A+ writer in regards to the strong plot.  Her writing there shows she still has the chops for an excellent psychological thriller.  Read till that scene and Fielding will pull you in with it and make you read till the end.  Her sometimes too detailed descriptions of clothing, furnishings and the like which are truly a la Higgins Clark need to be just overlooked.  The overall read here is excellent and to Ms. Fielding I say write a truly great novel like SEE JANE RUN to  remind your readers you still have it.  And I guarantee new readers will come running to read it too.  But this novel I can definitely recommend.  Give it a shot and really good suspense will come your way.

It wasn't just males in general but her family as well was treated with what bordered on indifference.  I suppose her response would be termed as 'survivor's remorse' in today's vernacular.  She lived and her brother didn't.

Ambrosia is having her fourth season and still hasn't found a man who she can bear to marry.  She was beautiful and had a hefty dowry. She meets the hero, Duncan, in a library while at a ball.  She had gone there to escape her mother.

Duncan had arrived late and had managed to get his attire wet.  He was waiting in the library for his clothes to dry.  He misunderstands her presence and her verbal responses, resulting in a heated kiss shared by the two.  He is a charming scoundrel who has recently inherited his title.

His estate is in need of a large shot of money, and his name needs a large dose of respectability.  A friend recommends he marry a woman of wealth and social prominence.  This was Ambrosia.  And the best way to go about it was to compromise her.

Of course this same friend is a lecherous fellow who has been trying to seduce her for years.  And there is more evil in him than simply that.

The book goes on to show the more or less involvement of Ambrosia and Duncan.  She is attracted to him and they share a couple of heated scenes.  For his part Duncan is attracted to her and discovers he admires her.

There is the usual misunderstanding between the couple and the underhanded dealings of the so-called friend to get through.

If Ambrosia had been written with a lighter touch I would have enjoyed the story more.  She came off as almost less than human and I had little sympathy for her.  The Duncan character was at least likeable though I wasn't all that crazy about him either.",2,"[-2.9980895694096397, -1.0070794424700396, -1.032520374039614, -1.0234144735166073, -1.2312868023151187]",-1.0070794424700396
356,"I was fascinated by Yuval Noah Harari's Sapiens when it was published in 2015: a history of humanity in 400 pages that rivals Jared Diamond at his most provocative and counter-intuitive.  Homo Deus has many fascinating elements as well, though of necessity since it's ""a brief history of tomorrow"" much of it is speculative. I found Homo Deus to be a darker work than Sapiens, but still intriguing and intelligent.

There are three sections in Homo Deus.  Part I recaps much of what Harari covered in Sapiens, with a particular focus on modern man's three victories over famine, disease, and war.  Anyone familiar with current affairs will gasp at the idea that these are ""victories,"" but Harari does explain convincingly that setbacks in these areas are only short term. I enjoyed Part I for the same reason I enjoyed Sapiens: Harari's ability to draw provocative and thought provoking conclusions and provide dazzling new insights, such as his connecting the Agricultural Revolution with the expulsion from Eden.

Part II, ""Homo Sapiens Gives Meaning to the World,"" is more of a mixed bag.  There are still plenty of perceptive insights which are challenging and often counter-intuitive, but they are intermixed with more confusing and less well developed ideas. I did enjoy his comparisons of liberal, socialist, and evolutionary humanism, but I think he was more than a little facile in his declaration that ""Gods are dead."" (He may have meant this ironically.)

Part III, ""Homo Sapiens Loses Control,"" is the most disturbing of the three sections.  Here Harari portrays a dystopian universe in which data becomes all encompassing to the point where humanity is no longer essential and is replaced by the gigantic, interconnected mind Harari calls the Internet-of-all-things. Dataism, as Harari calls it, is poised on the brink of a religious revolution more profound than any in our history. It's breathtaking and exciting, but frightening as well.

Homo Deus is one of those books that is so filled with exotic speculations and ideas that it really deserves to be read through two or three times before most readers can begin to comprehend it all.  It's definitely a book to which I intend to return, as I have with Sapiens, many times.",3,"[-2.0670756008665023, -1.9120307703812043, -1.2566922040654667, -1.007812849364393, -1.2002960169710013]",-1.007812849364393

7589,"The good:  Logitech is the first word out of my mouth. As a rule, they build solid, dependable products. We have two Logitech keyboards that we use and like. This is a Bluetooth keyboard, which means cordless. Having a keyboard on the Mini means that you have the full Mini screen to see what you are typing rather than the portion displayed above the Apple keyboard. The stand also makes a more comfortable viewing and typing position--like you are using a mini-laptop or netbook. You've got quick keys, which speed up the process--even quick keys especially for the Mini. The keyboard is fairly responsive--more so than the iPad keyboard for me.

The bad: As a touch typist, the keys feel a bit close together. If you use a standard keyboard, this might feel crabbed at first--particularly if you have big fingers. I personally think the Logitech keyboard is better than the iPad's, but you really are going to have to watch hand-cramping when you use it and make sure your wrist posture is correct. (I am particularly sensitive to this since I have Carpal Tunnel in both hands)

The heavy:  If, like me, you bought a Mini because the standard iPad was getting heavy, this keyboard will make your Mini top out at just a bit above a pound.  (Mini without WiFi is 10.8 ounces, the cover adds 7.2 for a total of 18 ounces) This may be better once I get done with carpal tunnel surgery, but right now--I am leaving the keyboard behind and using dictation unless I know I am going to need it.

Overall, I think the Logitech keyboard is going to be a useful addition to the iPad Mini. The weight it adds should be offset by its better efficacy as an input device.

2807,"I had never heard of Robert Whitlow before, but the man has written plenty of books.  The cover of this book drew me in - sort of resembled a John Grisham book or something - and it made me curious.  Another drawing factor to this book was the fact that it was a Christian suspense novel with a legal emphasis.  Having worked in the legal field for over 30 years, I'm always interested in that category.  Sprinkle it with a little suspense, and you've got me interested.

The Witnesses follows young lawyer, Parker House as he begins working in a small North Carolina law firm. His job doesn't pay as much as his friends but he finds satisfaction in what he is learning and achieving as he learns the ropes of a law office and of his town. At the same time, Parker realizes that he is somehow able to see the future.

While Parker uses his gift in the legal field, his grandfather, Frank (born Franz Haus), was forced to use the gift during World War II. This fact in itself results in the story going back and forth between these two time periods throughout the book.

Parker's gift is starting to become obvious to others, which begins to make him more interesting to a more prestigious law firm. As he struggles with his career decisions and decisions surrounding a new romance, his grandfather is experiencing deep regret for his actions in WWII.

The theme of The Witnesses seems to be how people can use (or misuse) God's gifts. While both Parker and his grandfather, Frank are good people, sometimes the use of their gift for evil is too tempting to hold back. Throughout the story, readers will see both of these men struggling with the use of their gift in a responsible manner and whether they will follow the Lord or not follow the Lord.

This book would inspire anyone who is wavering about seeking forgiveness and making life changing decisions.  If you have never read any of Robert Whitlow's other books, I'd suggest you start here like I did. The Witnesses is a book that seems to cross over those defined genre lines that include law, family, romance, friendship, mystery, suspense and even a little thriller.

Christmas-at-Harmony-Hill

 Ann H. Gabhart writes Shaker stories and this is her first Christmas one.  I enjoyed her mix of history (Civil War is going on), the romance (a young couple is separated by the war), and the family drama.

In this story a young woman who has been on the front lines of the war with her husband, decides to return home to deliver her baby.  Upon arriving home she must face terrible news and a unwelcome response from her family.  As a result she turns to an aunt she does not know, who lives in a Shaker community for help.

I found the Shaker story line very intriguing.  Their beliefs were completely new to me, and were more than fascinating.  As I read about their customs and why they do what they do, it made me think about why we do what we do.  I also pondered how their beliefs differed so much from biblical teaching and my own faith.

I enjoyed the story line of Gideon and Heather, their relationship was quite deep for such a young couple.  Their faith in their relationship and their closeness was very tender and sincere.

But not this time. The end of this book left me hungry for more. I am already anxiously awaiting 12th Grave to see where the story goes next.

But I suppose I should back up and talk about what happened before the last few pages. This series lost a little something for me in the installment where Charley had amnesia. The book after that was an improvement and this one has all of the Magic of my favorites in the series. Sometimes it takes me a minute to reacclimate to just how snarky and out there Charleys internal dialogue is. But as I sink back into it, I really do enjoy her silliness and irreverence. Thats especially true now in juxtaposition to the power she has turned out to be.

There is so much backstory and complicated world building to understand now. I am grateful the book begins with a bit of a recap in the form of Charlie talking to a therapist. Yeah, its kind of a device for sure, but it served its purpose well.

What I really liked about this story is that Charleys core mystery is tied directly to Reyes and the couple who kidnapped him and gave him to the monster who raised him. Usually there is an unrelated plot thread that Charley has to solve is a PI, but here its all relevant to her family and loved ones. I dig that.

I also dig Reyes. I mean really really really dig Reyes. He is so sexy and tortured and self-deprecating. He is also powerful and he loves Charley and their daughter so much. My ovaries could explode.

The secondary characters remain a strong dynamic as well. Like Uncle Bob. Great stuff happening there. Cookie's daughter Amber. Awesome. Oh and Osh, how I love thee. I cant wait until Beep grows up and we see your love story. He is one of my favorite characters and there is so much depth to mine there.

Theres lots of action. Big revelations. Sexy times. And laughs. It was everything I wanted from a Charley Davidson book. And I I am truly excited to see what happens in book 12. Bring it on Darynda.

Cats are creatures of habit and she has always preferred ground cat food (preferably poultry flavored). When you give her this type of canned food, with the gravy and the bits, all she does is lap up the gravy and leave the bits in the bowl. But I am sure there are other cats out there who will enjoy this food--to each cat, his/her own. It's always worth trying out a new healthy food alternative for your pet, but, ultimately, it is up to their own particular preferences on whether they will actually eat! That's a pretty small price to pay for all of the love they give us.

We start with Valerie, in the present, on the cusp of a life-changing reveal, and then are swept back into the past to travel with her on the road that led her there.  As a college freshman, Valerie is sheltered and inexperienced with the world at large.  She is struggling to find who she is and where she fits in.  Soon, she meets Ethan and he leads her to his band and starts her on her path of self-discovery and growth.

I felt her every pain and her every triumph.  I forgot she was a character and found myself wishing I could actually meet her.  Jamison had me hanging on to every word and rooting for Valerie at every turn.  The male characters where fully developed and each brought a unique relationship with Valerie to the table.  Jamisons knowledge of the indy rock band scene seems realistic and vast.  I especially enjoyed seeing glimpses of the past mixed with glimpses of the present.  I was sure I had the ending all figured out but was pleasantly surprised.

Jamisons writing style is fluid, witty, and captured my attention.  I had a hard time putting the book down and I cant wait to continue the story in the second book.  These are characters that Im happy to spend some time with.  I would definitely recommend this book!

1200,"Hood steps into the past with a two-pronged novel of women attempting to navigate difficult life choices in generations that have rigorously defined the parameters of female existence. Claire is a housewife in Virginia, thrilled by the imminent inauguration of John F Kennedy as president, personally inspired by his elegant, sophisticated wife. Living a version of the American dream in 1960, Claire has young daughter and lovely home, the relationship with her husband suffering from Peter's chronic indifference. Secreting longing for that which is never freely given from Peter, Claire is vulnerable despite the seeming perfection of her world. When a neighbor's son is kidnapped from their safe suburban town one afternoon, Claire finds herself unmoored, shaken by the tragedy and chafing at the choices she has made thus far. In a moment of recklessness, she puts everything at risk.

Vivien lives in a small bungalow in northern California in 1919, where she pens obituaries for loved ones overwhelmed with grief. Never married, Vivien harbors deep emotional damage from the devastating San Francisco earthquake in 1906, her married lover lost since that time. Unable to locate him in the ensuing chaos, Vivien still searches newspaper articles in her local library, still waiting for word of David, assuaging her unbearable grief by describing the lives of loved ones in intimate obituaries she writes for newspaper publication. Like Claire in 1960, she is bound by the strict limitations on female behavior in society, her passionate affair with David a breach of public morals, though impossible for the lovers to resist.

Hood's characters, each inhabiting her own unique circumstances, are defined by both limitations and courage, Vivien's scandalous and ties to the Victorian sentiments of earlier days, Claire's occurring on the cusp of a dramatic social revolution. Both are trapped in painful, emotional situations, Claire's struggle breaking to the surface in spite of her self-control and with far-reaching consequences. But it is Vivien's kindness and generosity that shines, despite the grief she bears and the sorrow that shadows her heart, a woman as extraordinary as she is wise. Hood captures the essence of each of these women beautifully in haunting images that ultimately reach across the years in a moment of perfect communion.

9753,"Frankly, in the past I have not been all that impressed with Science Diet/Hill's brand pet foods.  I am VERY impressed with their marketing, but when it comes down to ingredients and value, not so much.  Hill's has historically been the prescription-food side of Science Diet, for cats with special dietary needs, but the cats I've fed it to would rather die than eat it.

The Hill's Ideal Balance is changing my mind about all that.  The ingredients are good, whole foods such as chicken (that's right, chicken, not chicken by-products or chicken flavor, and it's right up front as the first ingredient), egg, peas, apples, and rice, and the cats eat it eagerly.  I'd probably dispute the need for cats to eat things like apples and rice, but Hill's goal was to create a food that offers 100% balanced nutrition, so these may have played a part in that (it's also full of supplements to achieve that balance, so I suspect not).

The price of this food is not as high as it first appears.  The nutrition is excellent and, again, is achieved with quality ingredients.  Moreover, the suggested feeding amounts are less than foods containing cheap, non-nutritious fillers.

One of the things I always have liked about the Hill's prescription diets is their money-back guarantee.  I was happy to see that this over-the-counter food continues that policy, so it's pretty risk-free for your cat to try this.  If you like the convenience of dry cat food, Hill's Ideal Balance is well worth taking a look at.",3,"[-2.8693722403996587, -1.0103197278365634, -1.0173494434109187, -1.0300827854143269, -1.054188032758429]",-1.0103197278365634

Kristin Newman is a comedy writer, who instead of settling down, chose instead to travel.  Not just travel, but travel to the fullest.

4 stars
M/F Shifter Romance
Warning: Unfinished ending - not quite a cliff hanger, but close
I was given this book for an honest review by Wicked Reads.

I would suggest reading book 1 as you will need to know who the characters are from that one because they are in this one as well.

OK, this book was kind of all over the place for me. While I really liked the story, I sometimes had a hard time following what was going on. We have the main couple, Devin and Marika. They are the couple that find each other in this story. However, we are still watching Charli and Barry too and their stories are intertwined.

Devin had kind of given up on finding his mate. However, when he comes to a crime scene, with his extra abilities, he knows that he'll have to get the help from the shifter unit and also knows that they will need the help of Fish and Wildlife since there was a mangled shifter body found at the scene.

The ""science"" in this story is funny, but developed. There are explanations as to how the shifters who aren't born that way develop and it's almost convincing. You are also introduced more to Klamin, the bad guy. He's interesting and intriguing.

Then you have the mystery of Charli's Barry. When he figures out what and who he was previously, before the amnesia, Barry goes running. It devastates Charli and we see their struggle to figure out whether or not they can overcome.

I really do like that this book left us wondering, but I think that more could have been resolved and revealed. It seems that either the next book will have to have so much information in it - right now, there are 2 different story lines that need to be resolved.

Riley was used to being the reasonable one, so she was a little freaked out when she wound up sleeping with her brother's best friend, Beck. It was so out of character for her.

What neither of them expected were the feelings that came out during this one night. They have a deep connection that goes way past the physical aspect of their relationship.

Edie Harker comes from a long line of vampire hunters, but never expects to have to take on the role as The Harker so soon. When her sister, Meghan, is killed by a vamp, Edie is thrust into the job. Add in the fact that Edie has been infected with a virus that will soon kill her and leave her 3 year old niece, Amelia, as The Harker, and you can see what Edie is out for revenge.

Throw in a vampire with amnesia who calls himself Jude because he hears ""Hey Jude"" on the radio when he first becomes aware of himself, the oldest Vamp ever and a few witches and you have a great book!

The book is full of action, angst, betrayal, pain and sorrow, but there is always a little hope mixed in. The author does an amazing job with character development and moves the story along at a quick pace.

Rough Around the Edges had the feel of the movie ""West Side Story"" about it, with gangs and intimidation in the impoverished Cuban community, not to mention the love affair between the rough and tough Alejandro (known as Alex)  and the beautiful, sophisticated, and educated Kristen. Alex is doing whatever it takes to keep the community centre open and Kristen is doing whatever it takes to gain acceptance from the people she wishes to serve.  Alex is deeply immersed in the lives of the boys he works with, even living on the property,  and Kristen goes home to her elegant condo at the end of the day.  Two worlds, different backgrounds, but a common purpose: to make a difference in the neighbourhood.  As so often happens, the people Alex and Kristen were trying to reach out to did not want their help, and they had to use methods of breaking through the barriers that did not impinge on their pride.

2318,"Parallax View: ""The apparent displacement of an object caused by a change in the position from which it is viewed"".

Who can you trust?? To me this is part of what this book is about, as in the story the protagonist, Tracie Tanner finds herself in this tenuous situation. She is only supposed to deliver a letter from Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to the U.S President Ronald Reagan, but what occurs along the way is very frightening. Why would Gorbachev be sending a letter that no one knows the content besides him. Tracie is ordered not to open the letter under any circumstance and as a CIA agent she does what she is assigned to do and protects that letter with her life.

The other part of the book to me is loyalty.
Loyalty
""Faithfulness or devotion to some person, cause or nation.""

Tracie is rescued by a young, air traffic controller, Shane Rowley. He pulls her out of the plane that crashed suspiciously as she was on her way to deliver the letter. Unbeknownst to Shane, he will be on the ride of his life. These two people are both very loyal to their country so they will do whatever it takes to see that the letter reaches President Reagan.

Parallax View takes the reader on the ride of your life. I was around of course in 1987 so I remember the Cold War mostly from movies and books. This finely researched and written fictional account of the CIA, KGB and higher up government officials in the year 1987 make for a fast paced page thriller that I could not put down. I love Mr. Leverone's style of writing as the story does not lag but keeps the reader wanting more. I can almost see a sequel to this story...

2137,"Theres a lot of interesting stuff going on in this book, though for some reason I found it to be a bit duller than I expected.

Euphoria the story of three anthropologists who wind up spending a brief period of time together while studying a tribe in New Guinea. Nell and Fen are married, but its clear right from the beginning that their relationship is volatile. Fen is brash, selfish and jealous of Nells success in the field of anthropology. Nell, on the other hand, is calm and thoughtful. She values freedom above all else, and would practice polygamy if she had it her way. As you can expect, when Bankson enters the scene, tensions quickly escalate.

The themes in Euphoria are fascinating and intellectually stimulating. It challenges us to wonder, for example, if its truly possible to observe or study anything without imposing our own subjectivity. It forces us to contemplate Nells hypocrisy: She doesnt want possession in her relationships, and yet she speaks about the tribe as if it is hers. It reminds us of the harmful effects of jealousy and power, both inside and outside of a relationship.

Still, in spite of all of this, there was just something missing for me. There were parts that felt anticlimactic, and there was quite a bit of buildup before it really picked up.

The POV aspect of the book also confused me from time to time.  In other books I've read, it was clearly defined whose POV was being described.  In Angel After Dark, the author switches between the two main characters' POV within paragraphs.  So she could be describing Angel's POV in one paragraph and in the very next, she switches to Alex's POV.  I love stories that have a dual POV, but just wish it was a little more defined in this one.

Angel and Alex are both very likeable and I found myself rooting for them to figure out what they wanted (and hoped that it was each other).  The secondary characters add a nice touch to the story as well.

Wright wrote extremely hard-hitting and truthful stories that we may find uncomfortable, depending on our racial background and political views, but certainly bring into focus why many in the early 1900's turned to communism as an answer to race and class struggles.
Understanding, first, I do not agree with communist propaganda, and only after reading this intriguing novel do I begin to understand the arduous struggle of people of color in the USA.

8397,"Cash is a badass biker. Rachel is as sweet as southern sweet tea. Together they are the odd couple but the Jamie writes their yin and yang very well.

This is the fifth (5) book in The Last Riders series and Jamie provides readers with enough background history to ensure that you can follow Cashs and Rachels story.

The story opens with Cash trying to get some pussy but he is cock blocked by the Porter brothers. Which is really funny. Cash decides he will ruffle some Porter Brother feathers by spending time with Rachel, their sister.

Cash is a member of The Last Riders motorcycle club. Prior to joining the MC, he has been a loner. The more I read about him, I realize that he has no emotional connection with anyone outside of the MC.

This changes when Cash sees Rachel again since he has returned.

Rachel is a novice and wholesome. She is patient and kind. She tolerates her brothers and their foolish but loves them so much.

Rachel has loved Cash since she was young. When Cash starts to pay attention to Rachel. The feelings that she begins to have deviously wet feelings for him (wagging my eyebrows) and this is unfamiliar to her. She is not use to that kind of attention from man. The love that Rachel has for family, passion and community is the same that wants to convey to Cash. Will Cash be receptive to her love, is he worthy of her? Can he be emotionally available to her?

I love MCs and this book was something new for me. The theme of book was not at all what I thought but how the author integrated this into the story line was fantastic.

My review has to be limited because; just the littlest of information will give this great story away. I can say the sex is good in the book. It is just enough to keep you wiggling in your seat.

This is the first book I read in the series but I was not lost at all. That is a great author. She gave me enough back-story of the previous books, to feel comfortable with the flow of Cashs book.

Happy Reading.

607,"What a quirky, sweet read! Part contemporary romance, part fantasy, part Christmas story, and part family drama, this book fits a lot into a novella. It's such a curious read that I got caught up in its enchantment and read it all in one day!

The main characters are well-developed, with real struggles and dilemmas. And the secondary characters are delightful. I just love the matchmakers on Sage Street, and Simon's family is so fun, especially his sister, Sandy! The characters are all so vastly different, but come together to make this one very entertaining read.

The only problem with this being a novella is that the story seems to end rather abruptly. It's wrapped well and offers satisfaction, but at the same time the ending develops quickly and leaves a lot unsaid. The issues between Cora and her family, while slightly addressed, are troubling. But in traditional fairytale fashion, there's a ""happily-ever-after"" that offers hope for the untold parts of the story.

If you're looking for a different holiday story--with romance, eventual reminders of the need for understanding and forgiveness, and a touch of magic--then this book is for you! And I simply have to add that this has an absolutely gorgeous cover: a hardcover with raised accents, a beautiful background scene, and great color coordination. Love it!

She now has a prestigious job and she's ready to start dating again. To practice at being more comfortable and sexy Emmaline calls herself Sarah. When she meets Parker she thinks he's the perfect candidate for her first one-night stand and she can be anyone she likes, because she will never see him again after that night. She's in for a big surprise when she finds out Parker is actually her new boss.

Parker is a young CEO. After his father's disastrous leadership of the Wentworth Group he's taking over the reins of his family's company.

He can't forget Emmaline though and wants to get to know her better, but they both have their careers to think of. Will it be a wise idea to keep seeing each other?

Taken by the CEO is a fun and sexy story. Emmaline has been hurt in the past and she's determined to make it on her own. She's shy and sweet, but she tries to be bolder and tougher, which was quite endearing to see. She's perfect for Parker. She treats him with kindness and respect, but also lets him know what she wants and what her boundaries are, which is exactly what he needs. Parker is a protective man and he's used to getting his way. Emmaline surprises him and I loved how she constantly challenges him and brings out his nice and forgiving side. They have plenty of chemistry and are a sparkling couple.

3445,"I can honestly say that Dev is one of my absolute favorite fictional private investigators. He's just your average, typical male with all the bells and whistles eternal bachelorhood brings. What I enjoy most about reading Dev Haskell novels, is that the author doesn't deviate from Dev's character, and his continuous pattern of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, so you know what to expect when you meet up with him in the next book. His behavior - which often invokes a good measure of eye-rolling in the reader - is predictable, yet strangely endearing. The only thing that differs in each novel is the kinds of trouble he get into. And you can bet your last dollar, there's always a woman involved. This, of course, makes for some laugh-out-loud, light reading. In par with the previous Dev Haskell novels, the author continues Dev's misadventures using a well-known cast of supporting characters familiar to readers of these novels. What makes these characters really memorable is their realistically relatable flaws.

The only disappointed here for me was that I could tell very early on who the culprit was going to be, and the motive behind it all. I was hoping to be wrong, but as it turns out, my guess was right all along - thus the four-star rating.

With all the hardships Sarah has faced, Sarah has a hard time believing that love can exist for her even if she longs for it. When Bill, a lonely cowboy, meets her for the first time he is knocked off his feet with her beauty and wants to get to know Sarah better. Even when Sarah fights the growing attraction she has for him, Bill falls for her more and is determined to break through her barriers that she puts up.

I have read this entire series now and I am in love with her Alpha male subjects and her strong female leads.  The way they all come together and just meld it is pretty awesome to read.
This series should be read by mature audiences only 18+ as there are some very steamy sexual occurances.  Some of the touchy subjects include murder and rape are the two toughest, then there is teen pregnancy, vandalism, adoption then finding biological family, and depression.
I really enjoy reading AJ Renee's books and hope that you do too!!

2763,"An enchanting and lovely start to a new Series by Amelia Grey.

The Duke of Griffin is a honorable and responsible Nobleman who looks after his twin sisters, his extended family and everyone and everything in his purview.  He was not always a responsible Duke.  When he was younger he caroused with his friends.  Wine, Woman, Gambling, reckless wagers and mischief. The wager that he and his friends made brought ruin and scandal to the young ladies that debuted that year.  He and his fellow Dukes have never been able to live down the wager.  Someone is spreading rumors that his twin sisters should suffer for what he did years ago.

Esmeralda Swift runs an employment agency for governesses.  She takes care of her younger sister and barely makes ends meet.  The Duke of Griffin walks into the agency and demands that she be his sisters chaperone for the coming season.  They are instantly attracted to each other. The sensual pull between them is intense. He has never been this obsessed with a woman before.  She is off limits because she is in his employ.

The connection that forms between Griffin and Esmeralda is wonderful and is the core of this story.  Amelia's writing is witty and charming.  I smiled throughout this book.  I loved Esmeralda's little sister Josephine and her dog Napoleon who will make you laugh out loud.  This is also a emotionally fulfilling love story that brought me to tears.  I enjoyed this story very much and will look forward to the next book in this Series.

2785,"Book Review of
Mending Her Heart by : J. Lee

I give this book four stars.
This book starts us off in a heated domestic dispute.  Elsy is in a horrible relationship and ends up needing medical attention.  Her only living relative Lyle is her cousin that lives 6 hours away.  Lyle takes Elsy back home to recover from her broken relationship and to hide out from his abusive tendencies.

This book follows along as Elsy mends mentally and physically with the help of her cousin Lyle and all of his close friends who have heard so much about Els that they feel they know her already.  Elsy meets Dino, Lyle's best friend, and the sexual tension throughout the book is noticable.  Dee gives Els as much time as she needs to mend before he suggests anything more than friendship.  Dee, also from a rocky background finds himself becoming more whole as a person after he meets and romances Els.  Elsy makes new friends and even faces her stage fright and gets up on stage to sing.  Dee and Elsy write a song together which everyone at the bar they sing at loves.  Dee and Lyle own an auto body shop where they learn later they inadvertantly hired a man who is helping Reed, Elsy's X fiance, learn Elsy's habits and how to trap her so that he can get revenge.

A truely serious subject of emotional and physical abuse including stalking and attempted murder.  This book explores many different senses in the reader.  Fear, longing, dread, guilt, sadness, joy and excitement.  Definately a book for mature readers with very explicit sexual content and violence.  Very well written and kept me engrossed from start to finish.
I give this book 4 stars and look forward to the next book that will follow 2 of the other characters in the story.",3,"[-2.86923382642692, -1.6012689733192889, -1.130749720637678, -1.0167921022672282, -1.2313778525351982]",-1.0167921022672282

3696,"I loved this fascinating Paranormal romance. It held all the usual aspects of a PN romance, but had that extra combined spark of intrigue and humor that had me in stitches a few times. I fell in love with Emma right away.  She's just an average, everyday girl working an average job in San Francisco.  She's genuine, spunky, sassy and somewhat quirky.  And when she literally run's into Teren Adams, spilling coffee all over him....she apologizes, quickly gives him info. to send his dry cleaning bill to her, and rushes off.  I love it...she has no ulterior motives...she's simply ""real"".  And when he call's her for a date, she's stunned that he wants to hook up with her.  She's modest and doesn't harbor false hope with relationships.

Teren Adams is part vampire.  He's more human than he is vampire.  For now.  His conversion to being completely undead will be happening soon.  His heart beating days are numbered and his human side will completely die.  He can exist on blood as well as human food.  His eyes glow in the dark and he has super hearing, speed and strength but he's warm to the touch.  He loves being in the sun.  And when he accidentally runs into Emma Taylor, she catches his attention.  He's intrigued.

I loved this story.  I love how genuine Emma is and how quickly she accepts exactly what Teren is.  She accepts his vampirism with utter fascination and falls for him in little time.  She's a bit disappointed that he doesn't exhibit MORE vampire traits.  To her, he's too normal!  I absolutely adored Teren...(who wouldn't?).  He's such a gentleman....so caring and so in love with Emma.  He would do anything for her.....just about.

 The plot to this story isn't very complex yet it's completely captivating and consuming - - and I was emotionally invested right from the beginning.

There were so many twists and turns it was hard to figure how who were the good guys and who were the bad. Enemies became frenemies as the situation that Riley and Naven were in became more complicated and changed frequently. The difference between the Queens and their worlds reminded me of the Light and Dark Fae with contrasting homes, architecture and way of life yet both Queens were ruthless and bloodthirsty and would stop at nothing to win the kingdom. Interesting how in the south one human turned heads yet in the north no one questioned a whole group of them appearing out of nowhere. It is kind of like the game of Chess - so many pawns in play all capable of taking out the Queen if given the right opportunity but will Riley and her friends be able to make the right move in time to save Earth and the people they care about.

Each day on the island brings about a new contest each lady must compete in in order to win a date with Hunter. Hunter and Liz rekindle the closeness they had when they were teenagers and as the story unfolds we get to see them explore their feelings. This story puts a funny spin on some of the reality shows on tv today. I don't think I've ever laughed so much than I did while reading this book.

Macy and Cal clash, fight, taunt, tease, and share a mutual disdain. Some is based on jealous for their shared best friend Mac's attention and some is based on the fact that they are completely different.

Cal thinks Macy is a rich, spoiled, opinionated, condescending Ice Princess. She does not do repeats or relationships. Only her best friend Mac knows what drives Macy to act the way she does.

She calls him ""Saint Cal"" for his holier-than-though attitude. He's a beer drinking, good guy, lawyer, who she considers a neanderthal. He is looking for love and stability, but so far it has eluded him even though his Ex would like to change that.

But their anger, taunts and insults make good, heated foreplay. And one challenge too far sends them spinning into hot, uncontrolled sexual bliss that they never saw coming. So good that Macy is willing to break her no seconds rule for him. But Cal knows going back for more is a very bad idea. Avoid avoid, deny, deny!

But when she needs professional help, he can't avoid her any longer and it only adds another layer of complication and ""Do not cross this line"" scenario. Their minds might know it, but their bodies aren't as smart.

Whoa! Who knew Cal and Macy could have such scorching, hot chemistry lurking under all that loathing? They are so different, but so very combustible. I loved their banter both angry and sexy. They play off each other so well both verbally and physically. We get Cal's point of view and little tidbits of Macy from her diary entries that hint at some things going on with her that I cannot wait to uncover.

Claire Hadley, 22, has had a crush on her older brothers best friend since she was sixteen when she took a chance on him and it left her heartbroken and pissed off.  Razer Bennington, 29, is a former marine trying his hardest to resist the girl who gets him hard and steals his heart.  His allegiance to her brothers and family is proving to be a real test the more determined Claire gets at finally having the man of her literal dreams.

Both characters were very likable. Claire is innocently cute, determined, and spunky. Razer is one dirty talking hottie whos being pulled in two directions by his love and attraction to the girl and his respect and loyalty to the people that were there for him growing up.

Told via Claire and Razers alternating first person POV, the story is upbeat, fun, and incredibly sexy (seriously hot) as the two negotiate their supposedly limited time back in their hometown.

It was refreshing that the romance focused on the light-hearted inner drama between Claire and Razer and her family with a few good twists and reveals as the story neared its close, and it wraps on a very sweet note.  Prick Tease is a stand-alone although the later parts certainly hint at future books for her family.

The manual says that the batteries for the red flashing LED typically last up to 3 months.  Some of my real security cameras have LED indicators that can be configured in the software to turn on during access/viewing, turn on continuously, or turn off.  None of them flash in a regular pattern so using the flashing LED feature might give it away (would have been better if the red LED could be turned on continuously).

Accompanied by his wife and a group of fellow history members of the Berry sponsored organization ""History Matters"" they search out little known aspects of the past that don't coincide with writings in history books.  For example, prior to publishing The 14th Colony Mr Berry wrote the ""Patriot Threat"" in which he indicated that the US Income Tax might be illegal.  This premise is utilized in the that book as part of the plot described.
  Similarly, in the current novel, the 14th colony is indicated as the present country of Canada.  It is indicated that at three distinct periods during the history of the US, plans were drawn up to invade and annex the country of Canada. These plans never came to fruition but were present and available if the US government decided they should be followed.
  Cotton Malone is the protagonist again utilized by Mr. Berry.  In addition, Malone's on again, off again girlfriend Cassiopeia  makes an appearance  with an eye towards reconciliation with Cotton.  Ordered to Siberia by his ex boss on a temporary assignment in order to meet with Alexandr Zorin Malone is forced to parachute into the area.  He is captured by the Russians but escapes meeting up with Cassiopeia who has been sent to help him and together they pursue Zorin into Canada's Prince Edward Island.  Zorin picks up a Russian sleeper agent left over from the cold war and living in Canada.  The two make their way into the United States and eventually to the White House in time for the inauguration of a new president.
  The actuality of the planned invasion of Canada, and a flaw written into the order of succession of US presidents in the eventuality of deaths of several of those in line are utilized as aiding and abetting the two Russians in their plot.  What they plan to use is one of five suitcase nuclear bombs stored away for many years.

2123,"""Hope Harbor"" by Irene Hannon is about Michael Hunter and Tracy Campbell both hurting from loss but learning about each other in Hope Harbor on the Oregon Coast.  Yes I know I am not known for picking a book that is an obvious romance based story but any story dealing with the Oregon Coast calls to me.  I am familiar with the area the author made her fake town in but the towns that she mentions around it are real.  The author really captured the area and some of the peoples attitudes.  The story was really good also.  Yes it was romance but not the over extreme love dovey type I hate.  There were a couple side stories in the book that were very good.  To me the main point of the book was not romance but forgiveness of others and of your own decisions that may have affected others.  One other thing I really did appreciate the author bring about the Oregon Coast was the affliction called S.A.D. (Seasonal Affective Disorder) which is very real and in that area it can be very overcast or rainy most of the year but still a beautiful area.  Do visit it if you every get a chance. This is rarely talked about and I was glad an author brought it up in this novel.  This was a very good book and I do recommend it.

This is a friends to enemies to friends to lovers story. Confused? This will all make sense if you read What Happens After before jumping into this one. While this book CAN be read as a standalone, I think it will give you a better understanding of Lisa's past, her character, and what led up to her current predicament.

Portia has fulfilled a wish for me. I was always hoping Lisa and Aiden would get together. It just made sense. They both come from a pretty crappy childhood, both stubborn, and both speak their mind.

My only complaint is that they didn't come together quick enough. Lots of angst going on! You know they both want each other, but don't want to risk screwing up their friendship.

I have to note that I was SO happy that Zachary made an appearance in this book. Zachary is a character we met in What Happens After.

An Indecent Proposal: The Interview is the first book in a trilogy. A trilogy that starts with Laurie trapped in a elevator with a complete stranger as she goes for an interview. She freaks out badly and the stranger offers her comfort in the form of talking to her then kissing. All the while she's revealing her darkest deepest secrets to the stranger because she's so convinced she's going to die. When she is rescued she doesn't see the stranger being pulled from the elevator and the building collapses as soon as she gets outside Is the stranger dead or alive? Was he even there to start with or  a figment of her imagination? Now too, he knows all her deepest darkest secrets and she needs to find him.

Three months later we find Laurie still looking for a job to no avail. She lives  with her best friend Jude and has to be engaged by her twenty third birthday. Impossible for a girl who pretty much stays locked up in her apartment and is not very social. In fact Laurie is a mystery. Jude devised a plan to get Laurie engaged and  introduces her to Chase. Tall, muscular and handsome Chase is the perfect person to convince Laurie's stepdad and girlfriend that they are engaged to be married. Chase for his part is walking talking perfection and Laurie fiends herself developing feelings even she doesn't want to feel. Is Chase Mr Perfect or will he end up breaking Laurie's heart?

I'm so confused! As confused as the beginning of the book had me I continued to feel that way throughout the book, I got what was going on and the reasons given but I want the real reasons to the events happening in the book. Laurie is not one of my favorite characters in a book. I wanted so badly for her to grow a backbone and say I'm a big girl.  I can handle the stuff that is going on In my life.

Not only does Josie have to take care of her uncle, but she needs to settle his wifes business affairs which include a knitting shop.  She has her work cut out for her.

As soon as she arrives, she is made to feel like an outsider starting with her ornery great uncle. Everyone in town makes sure she realizes shes not welcome. They want her sell the knitting shop and go back home to New York City. Josie does manage to find a couple of friends along the way.

However, things take a nasty turn when a dead body is found in the knitting shop and members of the town council make it clear they want Josie to sell the shop immediately. It's obvious to Josie that someone is hiding something and she intends to find out what that something is.

Josie Blair is the newest amateur sleuth to hit the cozy mystery genre and she makes a great first impression. I loved how she stood up to her great uncle and never backed down even when he clearly didn't want her help. In fact, she didn't back down from anyone, not even those who wanted her to leave Dorset Falls immediately.

The pages flew bywell, I read this on my Kindle so the pages were swiped by. LOL I couldn't put this down until I found out whodunit. It wasn't a total shock, but it was interesting to see how the story unfolded.

The author has given readers an excellent beginning to a great new cozy series. Shes given cozy lovers everything they could want  a strong amateur sleuth, mystery and even a bit of humor woven through the story. Im looking forward to another visit to Dorset Falls.

What do you do when you find out your whole life wasn't true?

Kira Dawson comes home to her mother, father and sister from boarding school. She's going to start going to the public school and trying to be a normal teenager. This doesn't happen. Oh, she meets new friends at school, gets in with their group. Has a little crush on Luke but he turns out to be more like a brother and she gets a crush on one of the evil misfits, Tristan. But is Tristan all that he seems? Is he really as bad as his friends? Possibly not.

EXCERPT 

He was the kind of boy you wanted to comfort and to kiss, the kind you knew would break your heart yet hoped against all odds wouldn't. The bad boy with a soft heart, the sort of trap a girl knowingly jumped into.

END EXCERPT 

I saw a lot of Twilight in this book (I love Twilight and that's not a big deal) and it threw me off at first. The blurb mentions Twilight, The Vampire Diaries and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I can see Kira being a strong female character like Elena in VD and Buffy. She gets told she's a conduit and she can do all of this stuff, she might can destroy the world. I think she handled it all pretty good and she does kick some butt in the book.

I liked the book well enough, I loved Tristan and I loved Kira's character. She is a kind person that takes on what she has to take on and does it good. There are just random things that didn't make this a 4 or 5 star book for me and I can't quite put my finger on it. Either way there are plenty who love the book and plenty who will love it more than me.

FYI: at the time of this review it's free on kindle =)

Mallory Adams was a tenant of the Boudreaux family when she rented one of the shops on the famous NOLA street.
On a night of untimely dreaming, Mal goes to her shop in the middle of the night to discover that a leak had turned her floor into a swimming pool. Immediately she searches for the landlord, who by chance, lived very close, Beau Boudreaux.

Beau was the CEO of the family company. As the eldest son, he was responsible for all his other 5 siblings and his widowed mother. He had little time for fun, and even less time to have a relationship. But there was something different about his new tenant. Mallory was enigmatic, friendly ... and had a real aversion to touching people.

What no one knew, except for two people whom she considered her family (Lena and her grandmother Sophia), was that Mallory came from a line of psychic. She was empathic (the ability to feel a person's deepest feelings through touch) and could see and speak to dead people.
Her grandmother had been famous for helping the police find kidnappers. Mal scarcely thought that the continued use of this power had killed her grandmother, her only family, so she didn't like to use her powers.

But through the time Mallory's co-existence with Beau's sisters and sister-in-law (Charly, Gabby, Van and Kate) and with Beau himself, in a growing romance, Mallory's powers could no longer be sublimated. And it all gets worse when a person from her grandmother's past decides to hunt Mallory, putting her life at risk in a way that the overprotective Beau could not reach...

Romance, paranormality and breathtaking scenes.
Kristen Proby delights and thrills her readers with a story that blends past and present, faith and skepticism, passion and fear, and a great deal of excitement and hope.

151,"A standard history of the human race begins with Paleolithic proto-humans, traces the development of modern man or homo sapiens sapiens, then chronicles the beginnings and expansions of human civilization from agriculture to the present. Yuval Noah Harari's Sapiens follows that path, but with several intriguing twists. The result is a fascinating book which will challenge pre-conceptions and occasionally annoy or even anger the reader, but will always intrigue.

Harari focusses on the three great revolutions of human history: Cognitive, Agricultural, and Scientific.  He asks how ""An Animal of No Significance"" managed to become the dominant life form, and  whether that animal's learning to produce his own food and then to further harness the natural world to his will through science  were boons or setbacks, both for that animal and for the rest of the biosphere.  In 20 brilliant chapters Harari asks his readers to consider not only what did happen, but what might have occurred had things turned out slightly differently (the roles of chance and accident are given a lot of attention.) He reveals the mutually agreed upon ""stories"" that helped shape human societies and questions their validity, not to disillusion but to challenge his readers.  At times the tone is unavoidably cynical, but at others there's a real optimistic air (leavened by some cautions here and there).  I found Harari's ideas fascinating, especially those in his final chapter ""The End of Homo Sapiens"" and in his brief but important ""Afterword: The Animal That Became a God.""

Readers who are looking for detailed chronicles listing, for example, the Emperors of China, Kings and Queens of England, or Presidents of the United States should look elsewhere.  But readers who want to be challenged and enlightened will find Sapiens a most enjoyable work.  I'm a retired AP World History teacher, and while I was reading there were many moments which made me wish I was back in the classroom so I could share Harari's ideas with my high school students. That's high praise indeed, but Sapiens deserves it and much more.",4,"[-1.741995165013006, -2.1009211895294375, -1.356642950179927, -1.021684401981326, -1.2992972177645614]",-1.021684401981326

After she left to be born, Logan made it his mission to find her again. But Amber doesn't remember anything from before this current reincarnation. This is the story of their current meeting in time.

This is a very romantic love story, based on the idea of destined love repeating through time. It was a very sweet read.

I found Amber to be a very likeable character. She had fire and doubts. She was the ""ordinary"" one, without any knowledge of the extraordinary relationship she was about to have. I found her emotions and reactions very understandable and reasonable. Logan was a bit harder to like. Sure he was the ideal rich handsome guy who swept Amber off her feet, but he seemed slightly one-dimensional. His character didn't have the depth or personality I was hoping for.

I will admit that I was a bit disappointed in the story. I expected it to be more than just a love story. The fact that Logan and Amber have a love that reincarnates led me to believe that this was something significant, and that something more would happen. But it was really just the story about their current lives. The fact that they have been lovers in past lives doesn't really mean anything, except to deepen the romance between them.

I found that as I was reading this, I kept having deja vu feelings, like I've read this before. I know I haven't, but I couldn't shake the feeling.

1104,"""Ava's Man"" is a loving tribute to Rick Bragg's maternal grandfather, written in his trademark spare, elegant prose.  It is also a paean to the rural South and to a vanished way of life. In the southern tradition of looking to the past, Bragg has reconstructed the short, difficult, meaningful life of Charlie Bundrum.  He must have relied heavily on the memories of his mother, Margaret, who was perhaps the neediest of Charlie's brood, and thus the closest to her father.
  Charlie was a man who was fiercely protective of his eight children, and a hard-working father who would do just about anything to provide for them.  He died at 51, worn out from long years of labor, and suffering from a liver ailment caused by decades of drinking moonshine.
  Having just reviewed ""...and Ladies of the Club"", this reviewer cannot help contrasting the southern culture Bragg describes with the midwestern, community-minded society of that book.  Few men of Charlie's era in that society died so young. The midwest is filled with long-lived descendants of the Germans and Scandinavians who first populated the area.  This is just one of the many north/south differences which will become apparent as you read Bragg's book.

  Charlie was a proud, independent man, in the Jeffersonian tradition.  Family came first in his hardscrabble life, although he was charitable, taking in an outcast older man who lived with the family for many years. Bragg has done a wonderful job of fleshing out the grandfather he never knew. In ""Ava's Man"" you will find it easy to look beyond the southern stereotypes to find
the real man, Charlie Bundrum.  Highly recommended!",4,"[-1.3527700714128992, -1.0780006495903427, -1.253784363407723, -1.0241864188389638, -1.0225562782036448]",-1.0225562782036448

The entire premise of the series is that there are 7 sisters, each with a different magical gift. A prophecy says that one day, the gate to their home will open for the man meant to fall in love with the oldest sister. Then, from the oldest, ending with the youngest, each sister would find her true love.

I liked everything about Liam he is a sexy, good looking confident billionaire, who radiates control. He has been hurt and gone through pain and is drawn to Amy. Liam seems to understand Amy and is patient with her and doesn't ask too many questions.

Escaping Reality is well written with an intriguing plot, sizzling hot romance and well developed, believable characters. This book had me questioning everyone's motives and not trusting anyone Amy meets or knows. I loved everything about this book, except the cliffhanger ending.

It stays flat under the sink and the neutral color works well. Both woven pattern surfaces are skid resistant and catch drips and spills effectively. It can then be wiped clean with a wet towel. I have my trash can under the sink and whenever my kids throw their trash in there they don't aim, so a lot of times those nasty things land around the trash can instead and make the area filthy. This liner isn't going to change the way some trash ends up but it does help the clean-up work much easier.

1587,"Old Shakespeare play Alls Well that Ends Well has since become a saying, an idiom really but an apt description for the ending of this book, maybe, perhaps.  I live in the book I am reading and always think of what else happens, carrying the story in my mind past where the writer ended it.  So I have to wonder how everyone got along when it comes out that the wife did not reveal her past, not lied about it but just put it out of her mind.  Deception by omission? Especially when her past includes a criminal brother, incarcerated, for murder no less, murdering his father, who was her father also.  When the brother escapes and visits the family he never knew, along with another prisoner, their mission is to take what they need to survive their trek through the Adirondacks.  And no he is not asking for his estranged sisters help, he is just going to take what he needs and move on.  Being locked up for so long he is a stranger to the modern techno devices of the current time and being clueless leads him to destroy what he does not know he needs.  As so happens his companion is a giant physically but a midget mentally so tossing some folks around to convince them to give up the goods is not a problem.  Even killing is on the menu, an impulse type of thing.  It is an action packed plot that easily sweeps the reader along with it to the end.

1634,"There have been quite a few books written about the lives of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, but it is safe to say no one writes these historical biographies quite like Stephen E. Ambrose.  The advantage with reading Ambrose is you get the entire story and then some!

Ambrose does not begin with the first steps Lewis took towards the Pacific, but the many steps involved in his succession as Captain, the development of his friendship with Thomas Jefferson, and what led to Clark joining Lewis on this most historic journey.  And with the detail that Ambrose uses with Lewis and Clark's travail across the American West, one cannot help but feel it is really taking years to get through this lengthy book.

The advantage of the audiobook is that apart from being very mobile, one feels, as they list to these well-read words, that he or she is really waling along with Lewis and Clark, listening to them chatter amongst themselves, watching as Lewis writes his journal, playing a lead role in the fights that place between the members of the party, and what led to the specific decisions that were taken.

My only complaint really would be that Ambrose goes a little too far with his depth, as the book carries on fro quite a few pages after Lewis' suicide, to the extend that the author rehashes what he has already told the reader, and reveals points of character about Lewis that the reader certainly already knows.  Nevertheless, plowing through this book is much like the journey Lewis and Clark took: it is long and hard, but a historical journey that the reader will never forget.

The story begins when our hero, kicked out of the British army and sleeping on a friend's couch (a friend who really wants to see him gone), is called to a meeting with the Foreign Office that turns out to be some kind of intelligence group. They say he's exactly the kind of man they need: intelligent, quick-thinking, able to react to changing circumstances. They want to put him on payroll as an assassin. In the nation's best interests, of course.

Our hero agrees. He's killed in the course of his career for his country so this can't be much different. And the money is an incentive, too.

So he's given his target's name--Geoffrey Button--and location while his new employers make travel arrangements. But when he reaches Geoffrey, he's surprised to discover that in fact, his job is to protect Geoffrey, not kill him. What's more, there may be a traitor close to his employers.

From there, the story goes in all directions as he and Geoffrey dodge Russian assassins, a Chinese assassin, the local cops, and their own countrymen. Narrow escapes and helpful beauties abound.

I really wanted to give this book four stars. But (and I'm discounting my personal aversion to the hero who seems way too full of himself for my tastes) the need for a good editor kept intruding. If this were polished up, I would have given it four stars.

This second book in the Maggie Dove series was more enjoyable for me than the first because the major problem Maggie was dealing with is now being treated in a much more natural way. This is still a Christian cozy mystery, but the main character has moved forward in her personal life to the extent that she now responds to people and situations in ways that aren't completely irritating.

Maggie Dove and two of her friends have opened a detective agency in a village outside New York City. As a reader I just have to wonder how a place this small is ever going to sustain a detective business, but only time will tell about that. This time Maggie is visited by a member of the town's most wealthy and reclusive family with a job. Maggie turns down the job and suffers the wrath of one of her business partners (who is written as if she's constantly in the middle of a psychological breakdown) and complete ambivalence from the third partner. Thinking over the situation, Maggie decides to accept the job only to be told she's too late because something has already happened.

I will have to say that the solution to these problems Maggie encountered came as a complete surprise to me.

1922,"The Messenger is written by Siri Mitchell who is a new author to me. I chose this book to review because I love historical novels. T time period in this book is set in is during the Revolutionary War 1778 in Philadelphia. The title comes from the character, Hannah Sunderland who is a Quaker, who ends up being a spy for General Washington and the Colonial Army.  There is an entire side story as to how all of this comes about but I won't give it away.

This is not a typical romance type novel, there is very little ""romance"" and is really more about the historical aspects and everything that went on during that time from Hannah's and Jeremiah's (the young man in the story) perspectives. The British take over her family's home, her brother is in jail for being in the Colonial Army, and Quakers don't believe in war and have dismissed their son from being apart of their life. There are so many little details and information to take in with this story that it took me some time to read it and understand what all was going on.

I enjoyed it, though it wasn't as good as I was expecting, I always have high hopes for such books.

I am interested in more of Siri Mitchell's books because as an author she did an incredible job with her research and writing.

If you enjoy historical fiction and aren't wanting to read a sappy love story that is predictable, this book is for you!

Two years before the start of the story,  her husband (also in computers) died in a climbing accident.  Since then, Diana has become agoraphobic, refusing to leave her house, conducting all of her business meeting on line, and seeing in person only her sister Ashley and her friend and partner in the business, Jake.

Suddenly, things begin to go wrong.  Her sister Ashley disappears, forcing Diana to consider actually engaging with the real (rather than just the virtual) world.  And something is not quite right with the business -- her clients seem to be edging away from her.  The virtual world that has shielded her from live people is starting to become a trap that hides the identity of other people from her, potentially leaving her and her business vulnerable to attack.  Diana has to find Ashley and uncover the link between Ashley's disappearance and the attack on her business.

CAFM was a quick read and a page turner.  Diana's computer world was fun, although ultimately not as important to the solution as I might have liked.  The author did a great job of conveying the claustrophobia of the life that Diana had slipped into and her slow grab for freedom, and the way her ""safe"" virtual world became almost a prison.

Its all within his grasp until hes informed he won't be considered without proving hes a family man and must present a wife. Thats going to be tricky because Mark already has a wife and theyve been separated for ten years.

Nicole is wild and free. She is not one to settle into what society dictates. For years she has lived her life in France where she is able to live the life she enjoys. However, she waits each day for the letter that will inform her that her husband has been killed while in service to his country. When he suddenly appears at her doorstep, her emotions are all over the place.

I loved this second chance story of a couple that have obstacles to overcome. There was just a tiny bit of misunderstanding that started the rift between them, but at the heart of it is a true separation of trust, beliefs, and wants. Perhaps a long honest conversation might have helped at the time but the fact that Mark was set in his belief of her position could not be ignored. Now, years later with more maturity and the opportunity to truly see one another, they may be able to heal what is broken between them.

Mark had every reason to feel the way he did but I personally thought he was a bit boneheaded. Nicole could have fought harder for him and what they had but she fled instead. Nevertheless, when you take those two decisions away, this story is quite charming with a bit of angst. I enjoyed reading how they reunited, placed conditions on each other, and came together for a common cause.

It was especially effective if you are or know someone who was struggling with coming to terms with an eating disorder. I was surprised with the underlying faith displayed by various characters in the book, and it added another layer of depth, in my opinion. There were so many good things about this book, it was hard to describe them all. The characters, although probably not the most mainstream teenagers, were realistic and very believable.  Your heart breaks for Calvin and Stacey, over and over again, as they try to work through their past and current struggles with each other, and with their families and friends.

Calvin shows a lot of strength of character in trying to research what he feels is happening to her, and then trying to support her and help her get better; even as she's in denial. Stacey has been through so much, it's easy to see where her fear and low self-esteem come from, and you just want to hug her and take care of her. I wasn't a big fan of her friend Zoe, but both of them are young and impressionable and neither really knew what they're doing. The author does a great job of giving insight into the thoughts, fears, and insecurities of teenagers and how easily this could happen to them. A definite recommended read of any mom of a teenage daughter, or son, for that matter.

2025,"There are four main characters in this book: Abby, Seth, Hannah, and Luke. Abby heads to Seaview Key after leaving a failed marriage and a successful restaurant, the latter of which made her very well off. Seth has moved to Seaview Key after serving in the military. Hannah and Luke are married to each other. She used to be Abby's best friend, and he used to date her.

Abby's arrival causes all sorts of problems for Luke and Hannah. Hannah is very distrustful of Abby and insecure about whether Abby and Luke will reunite. (Hannah is about to have a test to see whether her cancer has returned, so her insecurity is perhaps understandable.) In large part because of this insecurity, Luke and Hannah try to coax Seth and Abby into a relationship.

But neither Seth nor Abby is fully prepared for a relationship. He has a fear of commitment after losing the woman he loved while in the military. Abby has concerns after her failed marriage. And Abby's wealth is a source of great discomfort for Seth, who apparently is threatened by it.

The rest of ""Home to Seaview Key"" is strictly by the numbers. The setting is an idyllic place. The two people destined to fall in love put up all sorts of absurd barriers and act like adolescents at times. And characters cry repeatedly. The problem isn't that these things don't happen. It's that they seem to be required for books like this. I can't say that I disliked this book, and I'm certainly aware that it fills a desire many people have for the predictable. (I say that without judgment, for certainly I have preferences too.) But the story didn't appeal to me much since I found the excuses for delaying the romance to make the characters seem too shallow and immature, and I find the author's repeated use of adverbs in dialog tags (e.g., ""she said sincerely"" or ""Abby asked reasonably"") to be annoying and often intrusive, a hallmark of poor writing.",2,"[-1.8005734367648631, -1.3579646919926613, -1.1423360710985786, -1.0282908812713012, -1.2904662448907143]",-1.0282908812713012

Anna is a little bit different and on her 13th birthday she receives a mysterious package from the attorney. She is told that her mother left it for her, with instructions that she receive it on her birthday. Anna is so excited at the thought that she may learn something about the mother she never knew. When she opens the package she is a little disappointed at the contents. That is, until she opens the envelope and finds a letter from her mother. Anna, after reading the letter, only becomes more confused about the contents of the box and the mysterious inheritance she is receiving for her 13th birthday. Anna, as she tries to figure out what her mother means, discovers some interesting things about herself while she works on figuring out the mystery behind the couple who life in the Castle.

""Diary of Anna the Girl Witch"" is a well written story with great illustration that makes for a very good read.

Instead of fun in the sun on a sandy beach, they would be staying at a trendy mountain resort surrounded by snow, and ski slopes. It was the last thing she would voluntarily sign herself up for, which is why her friends have chosen to band together and guilt her into going. Knowing that she doesn't know how to ski, they figure the best way to make her comfortable with this whole situation is to sign her up for ski lessons. They have her best interests at heart, and all think she is in desperate need of some fun, and hope that some fun on the slopes may lead to a opportunity for her to find a little romance too...

Jacob Berkley has recently purchased a trendy mountain resort and is quite pleased with its success so far, and is willing to make sure his guests are treated to the best service possible. While doing his morning rounds he is mistaken for a ski instructor by one of his guests, and while he shouldn't mislead her, he just isn't quite ready to correct her. Something about her intrigues him, so he decides spending one day on the slopes with her can't hurt...

Evelyn Preston, known as Evie, is a waitress in a very popular night spot called Club Excess. She works part time and attends nursing school full time. Her tips at the club are a big help for her tuition.  Evie lives with her best friend Lourdes, who had been there for her since they were children.  Evie had quite a life change not too long ago and Lourdes is her protector.

Mateo Tres Santos is in charge of security at the club. He has had a colorful life, former military, he served a year in prison for assault and is a rogue MMA fighter. He has been attracted to Evie since her first day, but her fragility and sweetness make him think twice. She doesn't  belong with an ex con Latino.  After rescuing Evie from a dark closed room when she was having a panic attack, he can't get her out of his mind.  Evie feels an unusual safety with him, an attraction she has never felt before.

I'm not typically a NA fan, but this story and this couple are compelling. The characters are all colorful and add some sizzle to the story. The attraction between these two damaged people is strong and once past Evie's fear, very hot.  I enjoyed this novel and look forward to the next in the series.

724,"As The Awakening opens during the languid days of summer we find Edna Pontellier, Kate Chopin's main character, drifting aimlessly as if through a wide expanse of ocean or a great field of grain.  Edna is on vacation at Grand Isle with her husband and two young sons.  She often feels the weight of her responsibilities and the casual cruelty of her husband and becomes disconsolate, but she has attracted the attention of Robert Lebron who becomes her constant companion.  Edna has a tendency towards infatuation and becomes quite smitten with Robert.  She makes friends with others vacationing on the island while her husband returns to New Orleans during the week and begins her metamorphosis.
She tells her friend Adele that while she would give her life for her children, she would never give up her own self.

As Edna returns to New Orleans she begins to spread her wings and to cast of responsibilities like the shell or casing of her chrysalis and flit about on her own selfish quest.

Critics of Kate Chopin's time were aghast at the book and called it ""sordid"" and ""unhealthy,"" but modern day critics see the beginnings of feminist thought in the book and laud it as an early feminist novel.  This modern reader wonders if it is more of a parable of sorts.

Kate Chopin is a thoughtful novelist who slowly develops her characters and stories and is gifted at developing the scene as the following illustrates:

""The walk to the beach was no inconsiderable one, consisting as it did of a long, sandy path, upon which a sporadic and tangled growth that bordered it on either side made frequent and unexpected inroads.  There were acres of yellow camomile reaching out on either hand.  Further away still, vegetable gardens abounded, with frequent small plantations of orange or lemon trees intervening.  the dark green clusters glistened from afar in the sun.""

In many ways The Awakening is truly a lovely read, but its main strength is its ability to provoke thought and discussion and that is why I would recommend it.",3,"[-2.930234780428213, -1.3118395015239892, -1.173712345823119, -1.0334196922373944, -1.3512416367166526]",-1.0334196922373944

We had previously used Natural Balance Sweet Potato and Fish for our larger dogs and noticed that Ginger (the Yorkie) would scrounge around on the floor after they were done eating.  Whenever she got lucky, she would spend quite a bit of time trying to chew the kibble up, a daunting task with her few remaining choppers.  So we decided to get this Small Bite edition of the same Natural Balance formula.

After boarding her at a kennel for five days while we took a short trip, when we returned home we automatically put down her normal wet food, a bowl of water, and as usual a dish with some of this Small Bite kibble.  She ignored the wet food and immediately scarfed up the kibble.  Boy were we surprised!  The other great advantage is that her previously challenged digestive system has calmed down and she is back to a normal eating and elimination schedule.  No upset tummy and no accidents.

Using a grain-free dog food obviously has been beneficial for her.  If Ginger could say ""thank you"" I know that she would.  We are all very pleased at the results.",4,"[-2.0781080237102225, -1.2896362385231719, -1.1328331999758483, -1.0339248051077448, -1.4084971668586816]",-1.0339248051077448

Well, First Position surprised me. It was not centered around dancing or football; it was all romance! So, don't let the title fool you.

This book is the story of Emory and Mason. They have a past; a past that is filled with pain and heart break.

Emory was completely in love with Mason, but he left her when she refused to give up her dancing career. He wanted a Football Wife, that would sit in the stands and look pretty. He did not want a working wife.

Mason ended up getting exactly what he wanted, and he was miserable. He and his wife were getting a divorce. He had been injured, and his future in football is questionable. He is looking for a new team. While visiting a potential team, he runs into Emory.

A lot has changed for Emory, during the years that they have been apart. She was forced to give up her dreams of being a professional dancer, after an injury. She is now working as a photographer and living with her best friend. She has just broken up with her boyfriend. Her life is in total chaos, and she is not prepared to see Mason. She is not sure she can let him back into her life, but Mason is determined to win her back.

This book is filled with love, hate, pain, and secrets. Can Mason and Emory forget the past and focus on the future? To find out, you will have to read First Position.

This book was really well written. I love a reunion romance, and this one was one of the best. The characters were likable, and I felt like I knew each one personally. The editing was spot on. Over all, its a very good book.

Lina (Fontaine) is returning home on the train when she meets the suave, charming, rogue John (Johnnie) Aysgarth (Cary Grant).  He is going fox hunting and sees her again.  He uses his charms to meet her again.  Lina is completely taken by him even though her parents dislike his reputation.  He finally calls her and they meet at the Fox Hunt Ball.

It's a whirlwind romance and marriage.  Johnnie wants to prove that he has reformed and takes a job.  One day Johnnie's old friend Binky (Nigel ""Dr. Watson"" Bruce) and mentions that he saw Johnnie at the race track.  Lina starts to get suspicious of Johnnie.  Things are missing around the house.

One day Lina is out shopping and runs into her old friend Isobelle Lenke, an author of murder mysteries.  She also runs into a couple of missing chairs at the pawn shop.  Johnnie arrives home; he backed the winner at the races.  He has won 2,000.  He admits that he used the chairs for the stake.

Isobelle comes for dinner and Johnnie starts asking her about her books and ways of killing people.  This of course makes Lina even more suspicious.

Things get worse when Binky has an accident and dies.  She starts to fear that she is next.

This was a breakout movie for Grant.  Johnnie is a complex role. He is both good and bad. This role helped him break out of his romantic lead role for more interesting roles.

For Fontaine, this was not a great stretch.  She had just played a similar role in Hitchcock's Rebecca.  But she was stunning in her control of character.

He's never met a woman he couldn't charm, but for some reason Lexie seems to be resistant to his flirty behavior... and it doesn't sit well with him!!

It has been a while since I have read a story that completely consumed me the way this one did, I was barely a paragraph into this one and I immediately felt myself being pulled into Lexie and Kaden's world and completely entranced by every printed word. These two well crafted characters were definitely a match made in literary heaven, the chemistry they shared could be felt from their first encounter, and continued to grow with fervor right up until the very end. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment I spent with these two, their powerful story crept into my head and heart and reaffirmed my belief that Ms. Phillips is a true master at her craft!!

1004,"Review by Jennifer

Have you ever been hit with a blow so devastating that you weren't sure how you would recover from it? That is exactly what happens to Sydney in the beginning of this story. However the saying, when one door closes another one opens turns out to be true. Only in this case it was the wrong phone number that opened up a new life for Sydney, one that she never thought she would get.

Right from the start this story caught my attention. When Sydney and Brian met it was fuuuunny. I was totally laughing my butt off. I couldn't get enough of this story in the beginning. Brian was a very loveable, sweet character but he is hiding a secret of his own. He is living with very painful memories that he is trying to overcome and he may never get past them. Brian is in a very dark place and the only person who seems to be able to bring him out of it is Sydney.

Sydney is fresh out of bad relationship that she didn't realize was bad until she was out of it. Her self -esteem is at a low point and she isn't looking for anything serious. She doesnt realize the impact that she is having on Brian and she really doesnt know the impact that he will have on her life.

Four Letter Word is a story about living with your regrets, living with guilt and trying to move on. Its also about falling in love again and accepting people for who they are, not what you want them to be.

There were definitely parts of this story that I loved but there we also periods where I had trouble staying connected with the story. Overall though, I did really enjoy these characters and their friendship and I would really like to see a book about Tori & Jamie (Sydney & Brians best friends) come out. They were terrific second characters! This was a good read with some deep, emotional parts but also some funny and heartwarming moments.",3,"[-2.2563680214407245, -1.135318672221779, -1.0851207893694177, -1.037518331760619, -1.2047595925500758]",-1.037518331760619
4937,"I didn't know what to expect from this book, but the title had me cautiously intrigued and the description sounded like it might be worth reading.  This is a second chance romance, but the hero Axle and heroine Drew are unique.  They met when they were young.  He was in college and she worked at a bar.  On the surface, they'd seem to be too different from each other to form a compatible couple.  They became friends, then best friends, then lovers for one night.  They were in love with each other although they hadn't said the words to each other yet.  After their one night, Drew overhears Axle utter two fateful words and her heart is broken.  She storms out and disappears from his life completely.  Nine years later their paths cross again.  Axle doesn't know why she left him, but he's determined to find out why and to get her back.  She's moved on in a sense and become a financial success.  She gives the appearance of being hard and unfeeling, but only because she's blocked any romantic feelings.  She is very feisty, but also very caring toward those she allows into her inner circle.  Those who are close to her become her family, and they know how special she is.  Axle is an alpha male and very territorial when it comes to Drew as they slowly begin to rebuild a relationship.  He has to work hard to regain her trust and get her to completely open her heart to him again.  There're some unexpected twists in the story, and an element of suspense and danger. Drew is a super-strong, independent woman with a hard shell and loving heart.  At first, her exterior was somewhat off-putting, but she definitely grows on you.  Axle has to learn to temper his protective streak to allow Drew to be Drew.  Lots of humor.  A read I definitely recommend, but some might not stay with the story long enough to see its true appeal.  It had to grow on me, too.",4,"[-2.2077484473670026, -2.29461779645593, -1.3420548953287221, -1.0375576627281118, -1.10750186540628]",-1.0375576627281118

489,"Willow Chance is a unique character, she seems as though she could be somewhere on the spectrum of autism but that's never actually said.  Either way what we have is a pre-teen who is very intelligent though more than a wee bit awkward, particularly when it comes to socializing with kids her age.  Honestly even adults think she is a little odd, including the school counselor and while we're at it, he's a bit strange himself.  Willow has a passion for plants, pondering potential medical diagnosis (as an amateur of course) of anyone who crosses her path and then there is the fact that she is flat obsessed with the number seven.  Willow was not raised by her birth parents but rather she was adopted and now as we meet her it is just after her adoptive parents have both died in a horrible accident, so she is an orphan once again.  Unfortunately her parents were the only people this young girl actually had in her life.  There were no reliable friends or relatives to step in and help her pick up the pieces as one would typically expect.  There is something special about Willow though because the few people that she has connected with are interested in her well-being, there is something about her and her circumstances that touched people enough to care and to help.  There are several elements of the story that aren't realistic, such as regulations of the foster care system, for me that did not take away from the value of the book.  If I were a middle grade student I would certainly step into this book with a willing suspension of disbelief even if I were aware of the unlikely or impossible elements.  I was willing to suspend the need for realism as an adult in favor of a touching and thoughtful story.

Rugby isn't all that big in the states, but if you're a romance reader... Rugby is all the rage. Simon and his skills are no exception.

Emilia's mother married Simon's father -- but Simon stayed away from Richard and his new family. The first summer he met Emilia, though, he knew he'd want to hate her and quickly he started rumors about the thin track star.

Two summers together, that was all, and her opinion of him was forever negative.

Simon didn't have the best growing up years, and he found solace in a rec program. From there, he found rugby. Now, he's a hugely popular hooker for England and he's going to make the money he's made playing go toward a cause that is extremely close to him.

Stepbrother romances aren't necessarily my favorite, but I found myself enjoying this one. While yes, they were still stepsiblings, they were so far removed from one another that it was extremely easy to overlook that little bit of information. Simon had his arrogant ways (seen more in his journal entries) but as an adult, he was driven by his past and his desire to make things right -- his past, though, was definitely something he had to work extremely hard to overcome as it kept popping up and reminding him of his shortcomings.

I enjoyed that as a reader, we were given Emilia and Simon's back story by way of Simon's journal entries. I would have liked to have a more full 'before' story, but felt that the short journal entries worked well enough as they helped explain Simon and his reluctance toward spending time with his father, and then later, the steps toward becoming a better man.

There were a few great jumps in time (2-3 months) that weren't spelled out as clearly as I would prefer, but again... thanks to those journal entries... I was able to keep up with where we were in the present day.

I enjoyed Iris Parker's writing style and her ability to get into the male mindset -- I will definitely keep her books on my TBR list!",3,"[-2.9246978442200944, -1.6405199261257635, -1.2064828266790535, -1.0435826869300113, -1.2590475105804282]",-1.0435826869300113

Lyra passes through and finds herself in what appears to be a deserted world and a deserted city called Cittagazze.  She walks through the streets and enters a cafe and no one is around.  Cittagazze is a place where Specters steal the souls from adults, so all surviving adults have fled.  Children can't see the Specters and are left alone until they get old enough.

While scouting the city, Lyra finds Will Parry, a boy without a daemon.  He is also an outsider to this new world, fleeing his own after accidentally killing a man.  The man was ransacking his house, looking for old correspondence between his mother and father. Will stumbled upon the new world by accident, but it has him wondering about how his father diassapeared so many years ago.  Will is determined to find the truth about his father and Lyra is happy to help him.  Together they venture between worlds and discover an object of great power, the subtle knife.  Lyra continues to be pursued by Mrs. Coulter and Will continues to be pursued by the people that want information on his father.  They will both have to be smart and brave to succeed in their quests.

I really enjoyed this book, even more than The Golden Compass.  I think it has to do in part to the fact that I was already immersed in Lyra's world.  I knew about daemons, the alethiometer (compass), and Dust.  In this book, we start out in the human world, Will's home world.  We get to see him discover a new world and Lyra, a person with a daemon.  We get to see Lyra discover a person without a daemon and all the oddities of the human world.  As they discuss and learn about each other, it makes clear what some of the terms in The Golden Compass meant and their relation to the human world.  There continued to go be great adventure in this book and great danger.  I enjoyed learning of the subtle knife and it's importance.

She is a high school teacher with roots firmly planted in New Orleans with her Gram and friends. She doesn't really date or connect with men. She does not do relationships and never quite got over a broken heart.

She never expected to see Mason Coulter again. He left her unexpectedly six years ago without explanation. He is an archaeologist that travels the world. He is still charismatic, handsome, and even more attractive than before. And now he is back and needs her help.

Soon they find themselves on a mission. But they are also finding sexual tension and unresolved feelings that have been buried. She can be a bit of an overthinker, but when she lets go, she is funny and adventurous. But she has already been heartbroken once and she does not want to repeat the process.

Oliver is best friends with Elle's older brother Victor and the friendship is just one of the reasons why he's held back on making more of an effort to be with Elle, although they do have more than their share of clandestine encounters.

Elle and Oliver's non-relationship lasts for nearly a decade, with a lot of stop-and-go going on between them. Your heart can't help but break for Elle, who, in spite of an engagement with her late live-in boyfriend, always seems to set herself up for disappointment when it comes to Oliver aka Bean. There's no denying the depth of their feelings for one another, but Oliver appeared to take Elle for granted, constantly assuming that she would be there when he was finally ready for an actual relationship with her.

Oliver is a highly driven individual, with his primary focus on his education and then his medical career. There are reasons for his being as ambitious as he is, which certainly makes it easier to comprehend his actions. Still, there's no denying that there's a fair amount of frustration when it comes to his inability to commit to something (anything!) when it comes to Elle. Yes, he's always loved her, but doing absolutely nothing or the bare minimum to keep the connection going makes him increasingly unworthy of dear Elle.

This love story is more about having the right kind of love at the wrong time, especially considering how many opportunities Elle and Oliver had to be much more than they were for so long. Sometimes, a person simply wants to be secure in the knowledge that they matter and that the love they have for you is valued and appreciated. You can't help but wish people know the kind of gift they have in their hands, but sometimes, losing it is what makes opens your eyes to the truth. Kaleidoscope Hearts gets five-plus stars.

Sydney Ragsdale's year was not ending in the best way. But she was grateful to have a roof over her head and to be back in Hopewell, the city where she vacationed at her grandparents' house. There she had precious memories.
But she knew that everything was new. She needed to work, she needed to improve her self-esteem, and more importantly, she had a daughter who still dreamed of seeing her parents together.
While waiting for the day to start on her new job, after spending years away from the job market,(as a housewife, mother and wife), Sydney gets a temporary job at The Book Bea Bookstore. The same bookstore she went with her grandmother when she was a child.
Mrs. Bea Marron, the owner, was already very old and did not have the same energy of years ago, when she dressed the store preparing for Christmas Season. Sydney is delighted to be able to help. That would keep her busy when she would have to spend Christmas without RayAnne, who would be with her father, Jon.

RayAnne was struggling to adjust to her new life. New school, without her friends, without her father and with a new financial reality that her mother could not afford. They both had to give up a lot to be happy there.

One thing could unite them: the bookstore.

When RayAnne receives bad news from her father, and her world collapses, Sydney needs to be strong to help her daughter. And she receives unexpected help. Seth, the son of History teacher Kevin McAlee-Mac-becomes RayAnne's new friend and helps her cope with the cold winter days.

At the same time, Mac, who years before had been abandoned by his wife, Seth's mother, feels a connection with Sydney when he sees her lost and frustrated with her daughter's reaction.

The two families spend several moments together, which solidifies the friendship and some more feelings that begin to surface.
However, a new twist takes place and soon Sydney will have to choose between her daughter's greatest happiness or what was best for both of them in the long run.

A Christmas story about second chances, beginnings, family, fidelity, choices and departures.
