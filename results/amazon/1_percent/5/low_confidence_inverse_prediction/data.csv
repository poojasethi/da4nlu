As a recent breast cancer survivor, I can relate.  To the loss of your hair, eyelashes, eyebrows.  The feeling sick, seeing pity in the eyes of strangers.  Fighting cancer makes you a better person.  You no longer take anything for granted.  What a great book!  It is definitely a tear jerked, but it is also a scorching hot love story too.  Yummy!  Great book!",1,"[0.5912294431934146, -0.4124221187031689, -1.4284692617336687, -0.9068328844448271, -0.5320841307804376]",0.5912294431934146

5611,"Emma Pierce has loved Jane Austen's novel for years but since she's been adult, she's come to realize that Jane was lying. Romance and men like Mr. Darcy don't really exist. So, Emma has thrown herself into her career as the marketing director for a trendy gym that is growing all over the country. To help with their expansion on the east coast, the CEO has hired a handsome, smart man named Lucas to consult with Emma. She's immediately drawn to Lucas, but there's a problem. Lucas is Emma's ex-boyfriend Blake's brother. Blake wants to get back together and even while her attraction and relationship with Lucas grows, Lucas continues to push her back toward Blake.

I don't generally read romance novels but I was looking for some light reading after several heavier novels. Lies Jane Austen Told Me by Julie Wright was on my nightstand and so in two evenings I read the story. The characters are cute and Emma goes through her own typically-Jane Austen inspired bout of pride and prejudice. The novel is a quick read and I had to skim some sections because I could only read so much inner dialogue about how Emma just can't date Lucas because he's Blake's brother. With any romance novel, you need chemistry between the main love interests and it's there but it culminates in a rather sloppy kiss that didn't make me weak in the knees.

Lies Jane Austen Told Me by Julie Wright is a quick read and for someone looking for a pure, feel-good novel, this one is just right.",1,"[0.5895739078174391, 0.03647396746227227, -0.5100574177807229, -0.8929634938832129, -2.620006245693249]",0.5895739078174391

All the clues are given and discernible (if you read carefully) so all the action takes place in a very logical progression.  The characters are very likeable and read like real people.  The location descriptions are clear and recognizable even to those of us who live here in the ""flatlands"".  I liked Evan Evans.  He was not a bumbling, stumbling idiot but neither was he a self promoting intellectual who always knew what the clues meant but had to keep the meaning hidden until the last moment so that he got all the credit.

6453,"Wow!!! What an exceptional way to end Cross and Catherines story!!! I know that I have said it before but Bethany you are amazing!!! So talented and brilliant!!! By far the best mafia romance author ever!!!

This book takes place five years after Cross and Catherine get married. A lot has changed for them. They are now parents to an adorable little girl who has a powerful personality. Little Cece is amazing and refreshing!!! Her attitude is fierce considering she is only three years old. She may be sly like Catherine but she is Cross made over. She voices her opinions and has no remorse. I says what I says. Just like her father. She was such a great addition and really brought light into a dark world. I hope some where down the road she gets her own book.

Cross and Catherines love and passion for each other is like a river after a storm  raging and powerful. Life kept throwing obstacle after obstacle at them. There were times when they were separated but at the end of the day they were simply them. Two love struck teens enamored with one another. A wild boy and a sly girl. Their story may not have been perfect by any means but such as life!!!

This book is action packed and oh so very hot!!! Cross is nothing but yumminess on a stick!!! He is perfectly imperfect!!! He has a fierce love for Catherine and despite all the trials their love prevails!!! Thank you Bethany for another amazing journey!!! You are a bad*** author!!! Your mind is brilliant!!! And as far as Cross and Catherine go well lets just say

They were ALWAYS meant to be.
They REVERED each other.
Together they were UNRULY.

5249,"I have to say that I was really surprised with how much I enjoyed this! It was different to what I thought it would be, but a good different. This focuses on Rick, an author who has made it big in the world of Paranormal Romance and is able to live off his sales. He is happy to be a loner and loves nothing better than to go camping by himself and only coming back to reality when he has to check email or send off his newest books! He knows that being prepared is important, but with riots happening near where he lives, he stumbles upon a prepper site that piques his interest. What follows is his journey into being prepared, just in case!

This isn't a post apocalyptic book, it's simply a book showing Rick's life and why he got into prepping. It's the everyday story of one man's journey and how he goes about starting to stock up. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and getting to know Rick. I loved seeing him open up to Tina and figure out what he wanted from their relationship. I also enjoyed learning a few bits from him!!

I have to say that I absolutely loved Opus!! He is definitely the star of the show and stole my heart. I have always wanted a German Shepherd but we have 2 terriers and they are more than enough to handle!! But reading about Opus and his training just makes me want one more. You can see that the author loves dogs :)

In all, this was such an easy to listen to, and relatable read. It makes for a nice change of pace from all the post apoc fiction out there!! The characters make the book and I really hope we see more from them!

What can I say about Kevin Pierce, that I haven't already. His performance is flawless and he is easy to listen. He knows how to preform these kind of books and always does it well.

She has had a crush on Zach since she was 14. Now she's grown up and hoping he will see her as more then her brother's little sister. Then one night everything changes, and Dani isn't sure if its real or not. She's not sure what to do, so she just goes with the flow. Until the flow gets complicated and Dani has no idea how to make it right.

Zach is the hot firefighter, that has always been the honest, loyal best friend. Being raise the way he was, he lives life to the best he can. Along the way he realizes that hes had feeling for Dani for a while, but because of her brother he has stayed away. Now since she's moved back, he just cant stay away any longer. He's wants Dani and he doesnt care how he's going to get her. Even if it means losing his best friend. Zach is just swoon-worthy hotness.

Reconciliation isn't easy, especially when both sides still feel the burn.

The numerous underlying themes are my favorite here. Scene after scene offers something new to obsess about, from special recipes to re-creating moments from the past. The aspects and elements all piece together flawlessly.

Nicola is a single mom who is down on her luck. Her BFF is Steph who we met and loved from The Pact (side note, if you haven't read that book yet, please stop what you're doing and read it).

Great banter between Bram and Nicola. I love when characters can dish it out to each other.  Dual POV, which I always love. Real characters and real situations that make the story so good. I love the lead up - Nicola and Bram know each other from Steph and Linden.  Through the story, they really get to know each other more. It's not a hi, we met, we have sex, we're in love story. (Nothing wrong with those) It's a great slow lead up, and it is Bram-tastic.
I could say so much more about this, but I don't want to spoil anything for anyone. Just read this book. You'll love it. If you read it for one reason, that Bram is a dirty, sexy talker.

Darcy and Saffron (book one) are dating, but she's still not fully trusting him with her secrets, which ends up putting her again in grave danger. But that's almost a side story because of the rapid fire events taking place in the main storyline. Darcy is also still trying to prove his worthiness to be in the field on the homicide squad, and again goes cowboy, acting without backup, placing not only himself but others in danger.  And as the net closes on the leaders of the crime spree, a dangerous trained killer begins to target anyone who might stop his escape.

I love this book. It is perfect for me. A couple people said there is too much drawing and not enough journaling. Well, for someone like me -its perfect. I am not a ""journaler"". I can't ever think of anything to write and usually don't have the time. I always start out with good intentions... but after a few pages (literally) I give up, forget about it, and never open the journal again.

So if you have thought about starting a prayer or praise journal but are not really a writer or just don't have a lot of time - like me, this book will be great for you! It has gorgeous pictures/drawings that you can color as much or as little as you want. And there is just enough open ended thoughts and questions to get you thinking and writing a few words. AND - its fun!!!!
What I like to do is color in a few small spots then use that same color to write a few words. So I end up with a pretty picture and pretty colorful writing!

This would also be a great gift idea for a teen! So get one for yourself or a daughter or granddaughter, or that other special person in your life that you can never think of what to get them!

A contemporary NA romance that is truly beautiful, heartfelt, and moving. Both the MCs are believable and likeable. The supporting characters are perfect. The author blends loss and love throughout the story, making these themes almost like characters. The writing flows easily and it's hard to put the novel down. This sequel is even better than the first one (which is good). Although the you can read this book as a stand-alone, I recommend reading the whole series. Some characters show up in both. Perfect for contemporary romance fans!

Fun parts: the lime green cadillac convertible named Sherbet and piloted by the 80 mph Darcy, the singles get-togethers at churches scenes, Jay's emails to a distant jungle, some spiritual growth occurring in Jay, the narrator: a fun romp.

So, fortunately, a pretty crazy resolution to the ending of Acquisition occurred in the first quarter of Merger so I could focus my attention on Antonio and Laurens developing love story. And what a story it was!

Both Lauren and Antonio had high, thick walls surrounding their heartsboth so protective of their legacies, but both unable to deny their feelings for the other. I loved watching them truly fall in love, to become intertwined and yes, a Merger of their hearts and companies did occur.

The merger wasn't an easy thing to happenespecially not for Lauren, whod been fighting for her place in a mans world for so long. But with Antonio by her side, love and loves opportunities were hard to deny. It was such fun seeing Antonio and Lauren try to figure out how to make everything they wanted happen for themto see that major life changes needed to happen.

I think that Karen has really grown in her writing especially with this series. This book was fun and grabbed my attention from the start though it did slow down just a tad, it was still an enjoyable read. I had a difficult time with loving Olivia's character, she was difficult for me to relate to but she does grow through the book. I LOVED Clark and the setting is wonderful. The secondary characters are well written and really bring the whole story together. There are some great history tidbits and having been to Yosemite it was easy to imagine many of the scenes. I am eager to read more of Karen's books to see what she comes up with next!

Dear Bridget I Want You is a standalone. When these two authors collaborate you have no idea what to expect. I really enjoyed this story so much.  Its geography was on point. I could relate to Bridget Valentines character so much.

Simon Hague is a British doctor.  Oh that accent!  Hes working in the states.  Once hes done, he will return to England. When Bridget Valentine visits the ER where Simon is working, she is in the most compromising situation.  Its hilarious!  Simon cant stop teasing Bridget and the innuendoes he throws her way are really funny.

 Bridget is just getting over the loss of her husband, and is raising her son. Simon is known has the playboy doctor, has no kids, and wants no strings. These two characters are hilarious with their antics but are also sweet. There are times that it will break your heart, but will mend it back together. Theres some unexpected twists that will have your head spinning. Overall I would highly recommend this one by these authors.",0,"[0.17625710276422124, 0.5397815073618979, -0.8185659272130483, -0.9040906865834478, -1.791583386203512]",0.5397815073618979

More Than Mated Box Set  Grayslake Bears  Celia Kyle
Book 1
Love Ty and Mia's story. Mia is one strong lady with a horrible family but she meets Ty, her fated mate and her life is one long roller coaster ride. As always, Celia makes you laugh, cry, get angry and laugh some more as you finally reach the HEA!

Book 2
Van, brother to Itan Ty finds his mate in a human who was arrested trying to save her best friend from the sadistic mayor of Grayslake. There is a lot of growling, fighting and passion as this story is told, great addition to the series!

Book 3
Wow, this book really got to me.  Keen's story is so heartbreaking as is his mate Trista's.  Each of them had a terrible life before they met and the threat continued until her Uncle stepped in.  Such a good story of sadness and redemption for this couple.

Book 4
Isaac hasn't had it easy in his pack since he came back so he decides to leave Grayslake to take on another job so he can find a mate that doesnt shy away from his scars.  Weremole Kira moves in next door as he is getting ready to leave, she has scars of her own.  A great story that shows how two scarred and broken shifters can find happiness in each other.

6139,"Revved is the second novel in the Axle Alley Vipers series by Sherilee Gray and surpassed whatever expectations I had it because while I liked the first book, Crashed, the chemistry between Reid Parker and Rusty West plus the fact that there was a professional rivalry of sorts between their two garages was an intriguing twist. They you've got Reid's dark past courtesy of his abusive father who refuses to go away quietly and Rusty's one and only experience with sex and these two were a combination that promised to keep me interested and that was a promise that was kept. Rusty and Reid were sexy and steamy with just enough sweetness and snark to make them such and appealing pair to read about. They not only climbed over each other's self-erected walls but broke them down, learning to trust and earn the other's in return.

I enjoyed this enemies to lovers romance, though I wouldn't exactly classify Reid and Rusty as enemies, but more of business rivals with a huge serving of attraction on the side. Both main characters are surrounded by people who care about and are loyal to them and I liked how Reid's relationships with his right-hand man Law and his apprentice Dominic as well as Rusty's close bond with her siblings, Deke and Piper, and her best friend Alex. These two are as protective and possessive of each other as their families and friends are of them. I went into this sequel thinking it would be as okay a read as its predecessor, but nope. Sherilee Gray took the story and characters up a few notches and piqued my curiosity enough to make me anticipate Piper West and Cole Black's story in Wrecked.

The rescue, the past history, the past romance, and the still present feelings between Gage and Ella, along with the other characters in this novel (and of course the ones from other novels that were so well-fleshed out) made for an incredible read for me.

2930,"REVIEW OF:  THROUGH THE SHADOWS: THE GOLDEN GATE CHRONICLES -BOOK 3 by Karen Barnett

This is a wonderful, enthralling series that culminates in this poignant and gripping story that centers on the aftermath of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.

The main characters, Elizabeth and Charles, are caught in their own inner turmoils as the city swirls around them.  It is very pleasing to read a book about two such engaging and likeable people.  These books are extremely well written and the character development is superb.

Elizabeth works to help the downtrodden women in Chinatown, yet she must come to grips with her own difficult past.

Charles, an earnest and thoughtful young man is conflicted. A gifted attorney, he sincerely wishes to use his gifts to benefit those less fortunate.  His professional life seems to be careening forward in a way that makes him uncomfortable and can be a source of inner turmoil.

Yet, through their inner strength and resolve, these two good people help each other to find their way.

In this book, the third of The Golden Gate Chronicles, the reader encounters a spellbinding mix of historical accuracy, deep spirituality, and  personal strength in an extremely challenging era of our country's past.

This is a beautiful book in many ways.  Highly recommended.",1,"[0.48466897358122685, -0.6137782027391483, -0.6688051341467935, -0.8591821236693693, -1.8381898615332068]",0.48466897358122685

3348,"""You make the rest of the world disappear.""

After years of fertility treatments and miscarriages, Caroline's wish came true. She has a daughter. But it's not exactly the dream she pictured it to be. Lily her 5-year old daughter suffers from a developmental disability and a seizure disorder. The doctors don't have a clear diagnosis and Lily is a toddler developmentally.

Caroline has given up her career, she in the midst of divorce and all she's left with is guilt. Guilt for wanting a different life for Lily, guilt for thinking she might not have gone through with fertility treatments if she had know the outcome, and guilt for pushing her husband away and trying to shoulder the burden alone. It's totally unexpected when she meets Tate in the cafeteria of the hospital. He's dealing with his own heartbreaking situation, but together they are able to find the peace and love they need to face the difficult times ahead. Tate is perfection!

This book was so touching. I don't have children, but I imagine it would be extremely difficult to watch your child struggle and not be able to fix it. Caroline's emotions in the beginning of the book felt genuine to me, but somewhere along the way the story felt a little bit disjointed. After meeting Tate her whole demeanor changed. Suddenly, she was able to relinquish control and let Lily go off with her dad constantly. And what happened to Max? I had such a crush on him after seeing him with Lily and then he just disappeared. Overall, a great story that left me wanting to read her other books.

The descriptions were done so vividly that it was impossible for me not to envisage how Hawaii looked like or how stunning this island was. She captured it beautifully. I want to go there now and experience what Ronnie and Logan did.

Ronnie was a great heroine who struggled with acceptance from her parents especially her mother, who only wanted Ronnie to be as perfect as her older sister Juliet. Ronnie didn't let that define her and went her own ways. She did what she wanted to do with her life even if mother dearest disapproved. It wasn't easy especially when the man of her dreams married her sister. I liked Ronnie's loyalty and love for Juliet. Even though they didn't keep in contact Ronnie was always there for her sister.
Logan was fabulous and definitely swoon worthy. He was a beautiful and kind man who chose ambition over love. He regretted it too but made the best of the situation. His heart was filled with love for Ronnie and he saw her. Everything she was and in his eyes she was perfect. His love for Ronnie never wavered and he fought for her when it mattered. Their chemistry was steaming hot and what I really enjoyed was the history they shared. They both acknowledged it and respected each other's choices. They were simply each other's worlds.
The secondary characters at Moonwater In were amazing as well. Ronnie definitely found her real family - her ohana. Kate, Charlie and Johnny added a lot fun to the story.

This was another hit from Karina Halle. She knows how to write romance and this gave me exactly what I needed. Forbidden love, island dreams and fun times. I couldn't ask for more.

It is such a touching, emotional book, but with such hope and peace in it that you will be amazed.
  It really would be a great help to someone who is going through losing a loved one and feeling all alone. This book The Color of Rain is really a precious story.
  Gina and her husband have two little boys and then Gina's husband gets cancer and passes away after several years of fighting it.
  Michael and his wife have two boys and one girl and then Michael's wife gets cancer, but passes away in a matter of weeks. Both of those chapters are so touching and heartbreaking, but full of faith and love.
  Both of the people who pass away went to school together.  So they know of each other and have meet each other at their children's school.
  Then Gina tries to give Michael support because she went through death first and she is a great help, but Michael is a help to her also.

After the end of The Player and The Pixie, the anticipation for this book was huge. It slowly killed me. This book was downright sexy, sassy, and fun, filled with second chances and sweet heartache. It was executed perfectly and it was overall brillant.

Bryan Leech is known for his man whoring ways. He's a rugby player, total stud and he knows it. Eilish is 19 when the story starts and a bit naive to crush on such a playboy. Fast forward 5 years, Bryan is a changed man and there's a secret he doesn't know just yet, but he'll soon find out.

We also get cameos from our beloved characters, Sean being mine, and we fall madly in love with new ones. This is a series that must be read!!

2628,"If you're looking for your next cosy mystery to read, you don't have to look any further and you seriously might want to give this one a go. I don't have much experience in this genre but I quite enjoyed this light read. This novel made a nice mixture of whodunit with a touch of romance.

In The Big Interview Stella signed a new contract as a reporter for NBC2 in Bristol, taking her a long distance away from her old life and boyfriend John, in Montana. On her first day on the job she is shown around the Speedway - not a gas station or shopping mall as she first assumes - but a NASCAR track where she meets Lucky Haskins, NASCAR's number one driver for three years running.

What is looking to be the first sparks of a new (swoonworthy) romance is over before it truly began however. Devastating news arrives that Lucky was involved in a car crash in the race in Talladega and Stella is even instructed to report about the crash. Everybody seems unanimous that it was uncharacteristic for him to take such risks and Stella becomes convinced it was a matter of foul play. She is determined to expose the murderer live on tv but first she has to uncover who it is while the minutes are ticking away until the Live Interview.

The story flowed really well and it was built up to a surprising conclusion. It's absolutely not obvious who the killer is, or his motive to want to kill Lucky. At first it seems everybody liked him and it's only gradually that people's grievances start to surface and other things come into play. I really wanted to know who was after Lucky and the author did a marvelous job at keeping it a mystery for so long. I had to wait for the Big Interview too to get the full picture of the situation.

He will do everything in his power to protect Nikki and the people close to him; but at what cost?  Will Nikki be ok with what Damien plans to do with protecting her and them?  Or will she be completely against it?

If you've read the other reviews you'll know this is a cliffhanger but I would not let this stop you for diving into to this beautiful kind of love romance.  #GoOnOneClick #ReadOn",0,"[0.20376593134530285, 0.3708098107881528, -0.5113115662832333, -0.8974340978363844, -2.0942642291705833]",0.3708098107881528

2105,"I really connected with Caden! :)  She became one of my favorite characters of the series in The Red Door Inn and at times I really felt akin to her in Where Two Hearts Meet!  The pace of the book flows nicely and the shocks make it interesting to say the least! ;)  There are times when I wondered why Liz decided to do something, and there's a character that I wanted to be wrapped up a little more, but I'm hoping she will be wrapped up in the next book.  I also wanted more Faith content: prayers, scripture, and the like.  There were a few scenes that I devoured; I just wanted more.  One scene in particular was REALLY GREAT; I could have read it over and over again!!!  The sub characters are as great as the lead characters and I find myself wanting them back as well! :)  I also found the set up and sneek peek for the next book to be HIGHLY intriguing!  I'm a little torn about the wrap up of this one, but I found the book as a whole to be entertaining and fun!

P.S. There's one really big thing that upset me about this book.......THERE AREN'T ANY RECIPES!  All of these GREAT goodies are mentioned and not one recipe!  (sigh) ;)

6226,"*Sigh* I love Lucas and Jackson! Their romance and story, while heartbreaking at times, is so perfect and heartwarming.

This second chance romance is so effective because of how wonderful Jackson and Lucas are as people. This is not to say they are perfect. Jackson bends to the will of his father, who has less than honorable intentions. He has denied himself happiness to honor his father wishes and be the namesake of his family. Lucas has coped with loss by a string of one-night stands. He has emotionally shut himself off from others and seeks physical gratification to siphon the pain. Readers are incredibly sympathetic to these characters and what they have been through. We love them and root for them to overcome the hurt of the past to have a better future together.

These two, once they meet up, have immediate chemistry, and Brooke Blaine brings the heat from their first intimate moment together. Through plot development, the reader along with the characters, gets to see what actually occurred in the past, which increases investment in Lucas and Jackson to make it work this time around. The best part of the novel though is the evolution of Jackson and Lucas. Getting to see them stand up for themselves and against those set out to separate them is so rewarding! Plus, Brooke Blaine gives us a host of side characters I adore.

Brooke Blaine continues her MM reign. I adore her stories and her men. The relationships and stories are really something special.",3,"[0.34946636857979874, -1.1806065188955377, -1.4620473496711086, -0.8652060731098575, -1.6195097111060823]",0.34946636857979874

This was entertaining and fun and incredibly hot. Leary and Reeve have an insatiable heat and chemistry between the two and its explosive. I loved Leary's confidence and strength. It was nice getting to learn her ends and outs and really open up. Reeve was awesome. He was powerful and commanding in a subtle but strong way. I loved when he got his alpha male on! It was an excellent story of them coming together it was definitely hot hot hot! I thought here was great conflict between the two creating a nice amount of drama and tension as well.

In the first half I thought it was going to be a light read but it really ended up being full of emotion and depth. I was pulled in and invested. I thought the supporting cast was well written, I like how things played out with her friend Ford and her boss Midge was super intriguing. And the dogs name, I'm not sure why but I think it's one of the best names ever and just found it highly amusing.

Tom Hazard has lived for over 500 years, but has he REALLY been living? There's so much pain and sorrow that he's holding on to over the centuries, so much fear that he refuses to let go of.

He's lost the most important people in his life, and he's let himself be seduced by an evil man masquerading as his savior. This story is a look back on the most important moments of his very, very long life, and the realization that there's more to life then just 'staying alive'.

I loved taking this journey with Tom. I was so sorry to have to say goodbye to him when the story was over. This is a book (for me at least) that will stay with you long after you finish it. I have recommended this book to EVERYONE. I absolutely loved it, and plan to re-read it again soon.

Basketball Rule #1
In this game of life
your family is the court
and the ball is your heart.
No matter how good you are,
no matter how down you get,
always leave
your heart
on the court.

The Crossover encompasses so much and does it so well. It touches on family, friends, basketball, life, growing up, and the hardships and changes that come with this. While on the outside it may look like this is too much for a book to take on, Alexander weaves a tale through poetry that is both witty and heartfelt.

I love that Alexander so precisely paralleled life and basketball. They are interconnected in Josh's world. Both Josh's mom and dad play prominent roles in his life and it was refreshing to see strong parents who not only got along with their children but also parented their children. Josh's connection to his dad is an underlying theme throughout his story and one that played heavily on my heart.

Josh is a prodigal basketball star at 12 and alongside his twin brother they are an unstoppable force on the court. I loved the writing in these sections. You can actually hear the staccato beat of the ball against hardwood, against asphalt, as he narrates his moves down the court.

On the court, Josh is confidence, but off it, with the ever-changing canvas of prepubescent life, he is confusion, anger, loss. This comes across so clearly in his narrative. The imagery used while Josh works his way through all this is simply amazing.

I expected The Crossover to be purely about basketball and maybe a few references about the game of life. What I got was something that far exceeded my expectations.",1,"[0.28724465971303736, -0.5050076408349955, -0.9162527004566305, -0.9058829261269089, -1.5967892599629374]",0.28724465971303736

7025,"Whoa! I can't even begin to tell you what I loved about this book! First of all, the O'Donnell boys are freaking incredible, and Ronan is the top of that list. I've read every book in this series, and I've got to tell you, this is my favorite, and that's saying a whole lot because I've loved every book. Ronan is the oldest of the three O'Donnell boys, which made him the caretaker when Maggie up and left the family when they were younger. A lot happened in the younger lives of these boys, which carved out how their adult lives played out, but Ronan was probably affected more than the three as a whole. But when Hope Seaver gets off that plane to film the Hooked series, it was magical. When you laugh at the first page in the book, you know you are in for quite a ride. There isn't anything I didn't absolutely love about this book, but I gotta tell you, when Hope and Ronan finally get together, Lordy, get your fans out cuz you're gonna need them. It's nothing short of steamy, hot, jump off the page at you greatness. Hope is hysterical, and you just want to take Ronan in your arms and protect the hurt little boy that makes up this very complicated man. The ending was a WTF moment, made the whole book come together. You have got to read this book, especially if you've read the first two books. And if you haven't read the first two books, get them right away, you won't be sorry. Incredible series, love the way this author writes, and this definitely won't be the last book I read of hers. Would love a follow up of what happens with all three of the brothers, especially after what transpires at the end of this book. Did I mention how much I loved this book!!!!

3580,"#2 of the ""Secret Lives"", series, but can be read as a stand alone. See, ""Seductive Lies"". Fast paced tale of intrigue, secrets, long buried grief, second chances, finding your true soul mate, healing, forgiveness and finding true love. With the power of life or death,  can two strangers find their HEA?  Amongst much turmoil  and a very turbulent French countryside, an English father, and soldier and a French/English Lady, abandoned by her English father, find themselves in an marriage of convenience, to seek the release of three innocent children. But there is so much more to this story. What they find is secrets revealed, much danger, lies, betrayal, passion and healing. WOW! What a unique Historical Romance. Written with an explosive mixture of intrigue, passion, romance and love, against the backdrop of a turbulent France, during the Reign of Terror. What this author has brought to the forefront is amazing, very descriptive, you can feel the turmoil and danger flying off the pages. A must read! What is apparent in this story, is the author's knowledge of this era, her compassion for details and her strength of loving relationships and family. Simply amazing! I can't wait to read the next in this amazing, intriguing and compassionate tale. I am in awe of this story and the author behind writing the story. It has lingered long after the last page. I beg, you dear readers, to pick up ""Broken Legacy"", for your reading pleasure, you will be glad you did.

5400,"The Darkest Sunrise is yet another all-consuming beginning to the latest duet by Aly Martinez. And once again I'm held captive by this heart-wrenching tale of two people, both lost in their own worlds due to grief and the cruelty that is life, continuing to question the universe when their paths intersect.

This story is written with a depth I can equate to her duet from last summer (Retrieval/Transfer). Feeling the uncertainty of the whys and hows of the burgeoning relationship between Charlotte and Porter and waiting for the floor to drop out at any second, had my stomach in knots. But I craved that tension, the almost dread at what would happen next. It's a book that firmly grabs hold of your soul from the very start and through all the highs and lows, you can't help but love both Charlotte and Porter and their slow-burn romance. Characters extremely well-written and just so genuine. Feelings are raw and yet both know exactly how to be each other's solace, even when they try so hard to resist. Told in alternating POV's, you'll get to experience each thought full of hurt, joy and everything in between. There are scenes that completely gutted me and I still wanted more.

Aly Martinez continues to amaze me with her words. She doesn't hold back one bit with The Darkest Sunrise and I am sincerely grateful there are only two weeks between Book 1 and the conclusion, The Brightest Sunset. Clearly a test in patience, this very impatient reader can sense that the reward will be the utmost in satisfaction.

Not to be missed, I love that the author isn't afraid to test her boundaries to give us her very best. I was at times overwhelmed but found myself still smiling at the brilliance that is this book.

He's a detective suffering from survivors guilt after losing his partner and friend in a harrowing gunfight in Los Angeles.  Dante Sinclair (31) has dark hair and hazel eyes...he's a 6'3"" massive powerhouse --- stubborn, aggressive and domineering who is capable of gentle tenderness when it's needed.  And now he's recuperating from gunshot wounds in the small town in Maine, where he and his siblings grew up.

Dr. Sarah Baxter (27) is a physician practicing in a small town in Maine.  She has shoulder length blonde hair, brilliant blue eyes that sometimes appear to be violet...and a genius IQ.  She's beautiful and gifted...and uncomfortable in social settings but thrives in her Dr. duties.  She approaches everything in life analytically and logically.  Her world is shaken and tipped on end when Dante Sinclair becomes her patient.

This story doesn't waste time getting off the ground.  Dante immediately feels an intense attraction to Sarah that borders on desperation.  I loved it!  I loved how he wasted no time going after what he wanted.  He's obsessed with her and possessive of her and his persistent interest in her confuses her analytical way of thinking.  Sarah is brilliant but innocent to many of life's emotions.  And after a lifetime of feeling alone and lonely, she finally begins to feel wanted, protected and adored.

I can't stand putting conditions on love especially with one child over the other.

This time Serena is pulled into a murder mystery while on vacation with her family, are we surprised? Of course not. Issues follow Serena wherever she goes! And so do her followers Tanner and Nate.

I love the first two books in this series A Fool and His Monet and Another Day Another Dali. But if you missed them I am pretty sure you an jump in and catch up without too much effort!! 

Each of these stories involves Serena who is an FBI agent on the Art Crime team. There is always some sort of art crime, and of course some danger, but Serena's back is covered by her partner Tanner. There are some sparks between Tanner and Serena, but there are also some sparks between her and Nate, the superintendent of her building. 

These books are light hearted, clean and just great stories. I can share with my boys without worrying. Plus the characters have character, and make some great life lesson choices.

4095,"If it's possible Vanquish, which is Book Two in this dark and twisty series by Ms. Godwin gripped me harder and quicker than any of her previous books. Van and Amber are a ride that is filled with so many twisty and sharp turns I actually lost my breath a couple of times!

Amber is a woman that is very methodical with everything she does and Van isn't quite sure how to proceed. But that's the beauty of this story....they progress at a pace that's perfect for them and while you'd think they wouldn't be a good match for each other, they're actually meant to be together.

What starts as something evil and nefarious becomes a consuming love story. Going on this journey with them showed me that even if I'm not supposed to fall for the bad, who really is the Hero of this story, my heart darkened a little because when I got to the end, I was madly and deeply in love with both Van and Amber.

The deeper I get into this series, the more I'm in awe of Ms. Godwin. She has a way of taking the reader on a roller-coaster ride that has so many twists, turns and drops that we should have a stomach ache, but in reality what we have is a feeling of ""let's do that again!""",1,"[0.18612868988423426, 0.09356460799256927, -0.8486803167096526, -0.8912600419775111, -1.773765073473813]",0.18612868988423426

4420,"If you love a sweet romance with a splash of sexy, then youll love this one! This story also has suspense, past heartaches, and a happily ever after that will melt your heart. Its very well written with smooth dialog and a great cast of characters.

Sandra has been crushed by past relationships and has no immediate plans to take a leap into another. She has too much on her plate right now to even think about beginning a new relationship anyway. The highest priority for her seems to be her brother that she feels may up to no good. She will do whatever it takes to keep him out of trouble. Shes definitely NOT going to let the fact that she thinks that the new boss man in her brothers life is hot as heck get in the way of doing just that!

Nick is the bad boy that Sandra feels the need to protect her brother from. Hes mysterious, tatted up, and screams danger. He seems to be up to no good, but is he really? Nick is hot, sexy, and oozes with charm. His attraction to Sandra may be strong, but he needs to keep focus on the job at hand. Easier said than done!

Trust In Me is the second book in the Protector Series. It can certainly be read as a standalone, but I recommend also reading the first book, Talk To Me as you will be treated to guest appearances from past characters in this one.

I highly recommend taking this action packed journey with Nick and Sandra. As I said, if you love a sweet romance, you won't regret grabbing this one!",1,"[0.1857764091262033, -0.800719061779283, -1.079333936345348, -0.9083610099867112, -1.5680447996907838]",0.1857764091262033

George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Julia Roberts, and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.

The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful!

Jonah and Kate had an amazing date, and yes, Kate wanted to see him again, she just didn't expect it to be on the show she's working on. It's not that Jonah wants to be there, but as he has a connection to the story, he has to be. At least Kate being a part of it helps.

These two can't resist their attraction, nor the growing bond between them, but a relationship between them is forbidden per their contracts. As sneaky as they think they're being, secrets always have a way of being found out.

What happens when their feelings for one another are revealed? How is Jonah involved in the story? Will it impact his relationship with Kate? Is a HEA possible?

One-click now and follow along as Jonah and Kate, on the verge of starting something special, cross paths when they least expect it, in a professional matter.

How you can have many partners but until you realize what true love really feels like, you are just going through the motions of life.

Overcoming all the hurdles of growing up and trying to become what you have dreamed of, is the road we all take.

I loved that they each began to have quick (but hot! in a safe, Bliss way, of course) flashes of their wedding night as the story went on...hopefully it will come back to both of them in its entirety eventually, because it seems just to fantastic to be forgotten for good. Dex's family dynamic was a lot of fun to watch too; I vote that more of his unattached siblings will get their own stories just so we don't have to say goodbye anytime soon :)

I have to admit, though, that I was a teensy bit concerned that Ms. London wouldn't be able to pull off a convincing HEA for these two--things got to be pretty shaky there for a while--but in the end it was all good, and there were warm fuzzy feelings all around.

Wife for the Weekend worked well as a standalone; allusions were made to book two ( Kissing Her Crush ) since Luke is Dex's older brother, but you don't have to have already read that one to enjoy Wife.

It is no secret that I love Lynetta Halats writing style. She has a way of pulling you into her books right from the start and not letting you go and this book is no different. In this book we get to meet Denver she is a sassy girl who appears very tough on the outside but she is not so tough on the inside, we also get to meet her best friend Greer who I loved very much and he is every girls dream of what having a guy best friend should be. After we meet and get to know them we are introduced to Ransom who you cant help but have an instant attraction to, he is the HOT bull riding cowboy I mean come on that right there says it all!
This is a story about finding your way, learning to love and picking the road that is best for you. It is heartbreaking at times and you will feel all the emotion. I loved all the characters in this book. This is a love triangle that will have you switching sides all the time I know I was! It will be interesting to see which side you end up on at the end of the book? I am looking forward to seeing where the story will go from here.",3,"[0.09633341505291915, -1.1188740479659813, -1.1064976136946565, -0.9032632165918706, -1.0139907365220975]",0.09633341505291915

Harry Bosch is in a period of his life where he is not a detective, due to litigation where he is suing the LAPD for wrongful termination.  His half brother, Mickey Haller, a defense attorney, needs his help in proving that a client, accused of a horrific murder and sexual assault, is truly innocent, although the evidence puts him at the scene.  Harry reluctantly agrees to look over the case, he does not want to be associated with getting a murder suspect off, that would be going across the line and that was a line no self-respecting police officer ever wanted to do, it would be tantamount to treason.  After looking through the case, something does not add up.  If the current suspect didn't do the crime, who did, and where was the crossing?

It's hard to review this book without giving away spoilers so let me just say that its a story about second chances and about how we sometimes take our loved ones for granted and lose sight of what is really important in our lives, which is not our jobs but our family. This couple are on the brink of divorce and they go away for a 10-day vacation to see if they can resuscitate their relationship.

They run into TONS of unexpected adventures while on vacation, and lots of truths come out that they were hiding from each other. This is definitely a romance novel but there is a lot of suspense and intrigue and adventure as well. This is definitely one of my  favorites.

5429,"Jones' tale of two daughters contrasts the shadow life of one with her half-sister, the legitimate child of James Witherspoon. Married responsibly- and very young- to Laverne, who is carrying his child, James initiates a flirtation with Gwendolyn, fathers another child with her and balances precariously between two families. The novel begins with Dana Lynn Yarboro's declaration, ""my father is a bigamist"", thanks to clever Gwen's machinations, cajoling James into crossing state lines for a marriage ceremony that removes the onus of illegitimacy from her child. Dana's birth certificate bears the name of Witherspoon's best friend, Raleigh, when identifying paternity. In much the same manner that Dana exists in her sister's reflection, Raleigh is ever James' ""second"". Dana and her mother, both beautiful, are excruciatingly conscious of Witherspoon's legal wife, Laverne, and his daughter, Chaurisse.

While Gwen's reasons for remaining with James may be questionable, she is willing to forego much for his sake, championing her daughter's needs as the years pass. It all comes to a moment of reckoning in 1987 Atlanta, when small town inevitability ensures a dramatic collision between daughters. What is particularly appealing is the author's treatment of both daughters and their mothers. In two sections, Dana Lynn and Bunny Chaurisse claim their identities, their mother's struggles and the strong bonds between mothers and daughters. Each girl is sympathetic, each attempt to define their father's love and their personal relationships with the world around them compassionately told. Ironically, their similarities create a connection, a sisterhood that is victim to their father's selfishness and desire to enjoy the love of both mothers. These are strong women blinded by the need for a man, half-a-father for Dana, always out of reach, Chaurisse innocent of all the details necessary to protect her childhood. Jones renders all poignant, heartbreaking and familiar.

This is the third book in the series and it is Toran, Chief of Clan Kerr and Lady Juliette Hallingtons story. The storyline is flawlessly written, rich in medieval historical details and her characters are well defined and strong willed. Toran has always done what is best for his clan and prefers to stay neutral concerning the border wars between Scotland and England. He is ordered by the King to attend a tournament and kill the English Warden who is rumored to be corrupt. Once there he meets a mysterious English Lady with strong opinions and develops feelings for her. Jules also develops feelings for him and when he finds out she is the Wardens daughter he becomes conflicted about his assignment. How Toran handles this conflict makes for a wonderful love story that is fast paced, captivating and filled with action and intrigue. I loved the surprises and twists that enhanced the story and that Bryce and Catrina characters from the second story made an appearance. I also loved the epilogue.

This is a coloring prayer journal that gives you lots of beautiful art to color in and each page is uniquely different. There are amazing prayers throughout as well Scripture to meditate on.

The pictures to color in are really nice! There are animals, landscapes and more gorgeous things for you to color in. The pages are good quality and handle the colored pencils I used really well. Everything is wonderfully put together and has become a huge favorite of mine.

This is an extremely beautiful love story. But to get to that beautiful part, there were many obstacles along the windy path. Rene did a superb job of keeping the story flowing at the right pace and allowing the reader to see and feel each characters POV.

Matt and Grace are two characters you will find yourself getting completely attached to and understanding everything they go through. And as the story progresses, things start to come together. This is story of second chance love and Rene delivers it perfectly!

I loved happy feeling I got when reading this  I actually felt myself smiling at certain parts. I cried, both happy and sad tears. I felt the love in this book.

She was watching the Montana snow fall faster every minute and wanted Sam, the other proxy to hurry up so they could get this proxy wedding over with.  Then Jenny turned by the door and fell into the arms of the man of her dreams.

Jenny was so upset with the beautiful stranger Sam and they started of on the wrong foot, many times.  Their mutual love of Montana had brought them closer, but could it keep them together?

I enjoyed this book, and was thrilled to see it was also a holiday read.  I enjoyed all of the characters.  I especially loved the over protective big brothers. The town was well described and felt like a character in itself.  Jenny and Sam were such a cute couple discovering their love for each other.  I also enjoyed the way the entire family had family traditions and good values.  A great read especially during the holidays.

It is a contemporary romance that is lighthearted, funny and refreshing read along with the right amount of drama and intrigue. Mary writes from dual POV and that is one thing I love when I am reading a story as it gives it so much more depth and and insight to who they are.

Kelsey is a young single mom who is relatively new to town after being cast aside from her family. When she is called upon and assigned to take part in a special night for the good of the town, who is she to say no. Little did she know that this one night would turn out to be the rest of her life. One night shared with a stranger that made her think there could be more to life. But will secrets and lies keep her from her HEA?

This book is he continuation of Charlotte and Porters story and picks up from that heart-stopping, jaw-dropping moment where the first book left off!!!

I cried, laughed and loved with them. I felt all of their emotions down to the anger. And let me tell you there was anger. But by the end there was so much happiness.

The strength of these characters is outstanding and they have so much goodness in their hearts.  They still  have a hard and long road ahead of them but their love for each other outweighs everything. I am positive there is nothing they cant handle as long as they do it together.

When Haller has a tough case and his investigator is injured, he asks Bosch to do the investigation.  This is a tough decision for Bosch, it would mean crossing the aisle from the prosecusion's side to the defense.  At first, Bosch thinks he can find out if the defendant is guilty without anyone knowing he's doing it.  And he's fairly sure the defendant is guilty.  But soon Bosch is asking a lot of questions and unfortunately it becomes known that he's on the defense's side.  This is very uncomfortable for Bosch.  He's been a cop too long to find it easy being on the defense's side.  But he can't stop himself from finding out the truth.  As a defense attorney, Haller is only interested in clearing his client, not finding who the real culprit is.  But Bosch can't ignore who is responsible.  The joy of reading about Haller's expertise in the courtroom is fairly short, but very satisfying.  It will be very interesting to find out what Bosch does in the next book.  Will he continue as Haller's investigator or find something else to occupy his time.  Connelly is great at developing a great plot with lots of unexpected twists and turns.  He also writes satisfying characters.  Both Bosch and Haller are great characters that I'm always looking forward to reading again.

2762,"This was such an intense and passionate world with these gritty characters that completely pull me in. I didn't want it to end and I couldn't read it fast enough all at the same time. I held my breath and loved every second. Fantastic story!

Luca and Gabrielle were wonderful characters. They were extremely well developed with real depth and I loved that they came from completely opposite worlds. I loved their connection and chemistry. Luca was so completely alpha and I loved his protectiveness and commanding presence. He exuded strength and confidence and he was filled with so much passion. Gabrielle was fantastic as well. She was tough as nails and working through some things and healing from a past trauma. Their worlds colliding was the best kind of roller coaster ride. I loved the drama and action, but I loved their sweet moments as well. It was the perfect combination. The heat factor was high up there too and oh my did Luca have a mouth on him with the dirty talk.

There are a couple of different things in play that all intersect and I loved when all those different elements combined, it made for a very elaborate and detailed story that pretty much had me on the edge of my seat. There are a lot of players and elements, and different POVs and I couldn't turn the page fast enough. Just like in Nico (book 1), there is an extra person besides the hero and heroine and I find this so appealing, adding so much more to the story and I thing that extra perspective is extremely clever.

I am so excited for Frankie's story and liked getting more insight on him. He seems so intense! There were bits of foreshadowing that has me wanting more of him (book three, Rocco, won't get here fast enough!).

I love stories like this, that slowly unfold in this perfect way with all these little details building and building. It was all fantastic. There was just so much drama that had me hooked. Everything around me faded away. And that ending! Action packed! Totally blew me away. It was all so exciting! From beginning to end I was mesmerized by this crazy intense world.

He might color outside the lines, but he manages to turn it around and come out on top.  He's a good man.

My need to protect her was overwhelming.  I'd never felt anything like it.  She was sunshine and warmth and fire under my skin.

Elaine's voice grew wistful, 'If you love someone, set him free.' ... 'If he doesn't come back, hunt him down and kill him.'

He kissed me like I was a country to be liberated, and he was he Marine for the job.

I saw you and my soul came to live inside me.

The first time I saw you in Arizona, I knew you were something special.  Only, I thought it would just be a week-long special.

My Review:

This was my first time reading Tia Louise, and I don't know what took me so long  I could kick myself.  It was well-written, emotive, insightful, descriptive, and held my attention beginning to end.  I am an instant fan.  The sensual scenes were volcanically hot and had me gasping to catch my breath.  Written with a melancholy air, this piece was frequently angsty, occasionally humorous, and continually engaging.  I am hooked.  I want to go backward in the series and read them all.  Tia Louise currently holds the top spot on my favorites list.",4,"[-0.26204557471953027, -1.1936767706543328, -1.0716556599203952, -0.9015886816777728, -0.6610095369737021]",-0.26204557471953027

River and Vaughn, be prepared to fall in love with this couple, wholeheartedly. Their story is about second chances.  Their story is the modern day ""star crossed lovers"" that were fated to be apart by those who did not want them together. But their love is fated by circumstances.  Fated by their own history of self worth.  I loved Vaughn, his determination, and his persistence, but River is where my crush resides in.  Her heart, her spunk, her struggle and her battles made her stronger.  She's the epitome of what a true heroine is.

6059,"What a wonderful 5 star must read addition to this awesome series!! And to finally give us the redemption of Julian Dane was just perfect!! I knew Carly would not have introduced us to this beautiful troubled man without a plan in place to one day show us the real Julian, one that we could fall in love with and call hero. I believe that is who we got in this book, the real Julian, and oh how happy I am for that. He has worked so hard to climb out of the rabbit hole and clean up his life and stay on the straight and narrow. He shows great strength of character now and is definitely someone worthy of forgiveness and of finding his own HEA. Granted it took was what he had done to Kendall and to his best friends to realize how badly he needed to change, but he did it and is now a much better man for it.
Kendall has grown so much since when they together before and has finally received the help she needed for her bi-polar disorder to stay steady and grounded. She is happy and well adjusted to her meds and now living a fulfilling life. She is very passionate about the rescue dogs she works with and it is through that where she and Julian reconnect again.
But is she ready to accept Julian back into her life and forgive him? Can she? Can they take what they had before and syphon out the good and healthy parts and build from that? Can Kendall's twin sister Lexie ever accept Julian with Kendall after everything that happened before? Will Kade?
This is a story about connection, commitment, redemption, forgiveness and love. It is very well written and the serious issues that are intertwined throughout the book are handled beautifully by the author.

Alexia Burton is an actress whose career is on the right track.  Except for one thing.  Her complete lack of sexual confidence and experience.  Believing her mom gave up her dreams for a man has given her an unhealthy view of relationships and so she has avoided them completely.

Parker Hargreaves was the stereotypical little rich kid.  After his mother tragically dies he goes on a trip that changes his life and his outlook on the world.  When Alexia returns to Byron Bay, he wants to make amends and hopefully come to matter to her as much as she has meant to him,

When Alexia and Parker are reunited they find that the attraction they felt as teens still blazes between them.  Soon Alexia realizes that Parker might be her only chance at advancing her career and accepts his help.

Alexia's vulnerability was touching.  Her struggle between following her dreams and following her dreams was hard to read.  Parker is just as vulnerable.  He's experienced a total priority shift and wants to prove to Alexia that he has changed his ways.  Their romance is both sweet and spicy very satisfying.  The story was very well written, the characters and the setting were drawn very, very well.

6704,"This is hands down my favorite Fusion series book.  The chemistry and the relationship - just everything - is fantastic.

These characters are so wonderful together and apart.  Trevor is a fantastic hero.  I loved him from the very first moment I met him. He is charming and witty, and his interactions with the girls is great.  I also love that he is attentive and loving with Riley, and he accepts her for who she is.  Riley is my favorite heroine of the group. She is sassy and smart, and she is not scared to put people in their place. Every single time she stands up for herself and their relationship, I just fell more and more under her spell.  These two together, though, are something special.  The way interact and are attentive with each other is magical. With each page, I became infatuated with their love.

The Fusion series has been such a delightful set of stories.  They are light and fun with low conflict and angst, but this one is my absolute favorite.  Like the other books in the series, it is also low on the conflict and drama, but there is enough to keep reader interest. Readers are also going to like the heroine's reaction to the conflict as well as the hero's resolution to the conflict, and Kristen Proby delivers another wonderful conclusion that not only wraps up the story but also leaves readers excited for the next book in the series.

If you are looking for a light book with a host of fantastic heroines and good hearted heroes, this is the series for you.  With each book, readers get romance and steam with a low-angst story, making the perfect relaxing, low-stress read.

Gavin was so wonderful! I just wanted to hug him, squeeze him, and love him. Devoted and sweet, I couldn't get enough of him. Jordan was great as well, I love her strength and determination. They were great together and I absolutely enjoyed their story, it was engaging. It was such a sweet story, so loving, and there was a nice amount of heat between the two.

This story had me completely pulled in. Really good pace and development. I was curious about what would happen next. I thought it was a lighter story with some heavier content touched upon, it was laid out well. I liked the secondary story that was in play, it added a bit of drama and suspense.

I really enjoyed all the characters that were introduced and the playfulness of Gavin's brothers. His parents were awesome as well. Jordan's daughters were adorable and I love how Gavin was with him.

This was just a wonderful story. Heartfelt and romantic! I love stories about reconnecting and this was definitely a great one!

Together Rex and Margery are very sexy and meant for each other.

Romance, Clean, some Christian elements.
I have not read the first book in this series, but will definitely look for it now! I have read some of D. H.'s other series, and have enjoyed them. This was definitely well-done, and left me wanting more in a good way.
Lucy and Zac's story, the gradual unfolding of the missing 7 months, along with their inner desires, and chemistry was lovely to read. The everyday occurrences, the town residents, the family, the events, it all was so cleverly interwoven. It was nice to see that even as Lucy's memory came back, she remembered that Zac loved her. I loved how the town pulled in around her, and softened in her time of need.
As Lucy heals from her past, she is so lucky and blessed to have the love of a good man, friends, and her real 'family' there for her. Definitely my favorite a HEA that had her truly loved and cared for with a good man beside her. Some great characters, great feelings, and some lovely moments.

Even with alternative motives going in Macie (Martha, MJ) never expected things to turn out the way they did. Once she is fully immersed into Ross and his daughter Sam's life all things she was working on come to a screeching halt. I love the changes and growth with the 3 of them. The realization of what they have been working for isn't what they want at the end of the day is beautiful. The transformation with Macie is lovely. The chemistry is amazing between Ross and Macie. I love the bond she creates with Sam too.
