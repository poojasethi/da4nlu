1,"Any time you have one of those days when everything goes wrong, consider the case of the hero of this classic novel.

Julian English seems to have it all: He is the son of one of the city's most prominent men, is president of the Cadillac dealership, is married to a beautiful and intelligent woman, and socializes with the young Country Club set. And then one night, with a bit too much bootleg liquor inside him, he throws a drink in the face of a ""friend"" (who happens to have loaned his business $20,000) who is irritatingly telling long-winded stories. Julian's wife is upset and embarrassed and they argue. And the next night he further humiliates her by again drinking too much and apparently seducing a mobster's mistress right in front of her and their friends. And things go downhill from there.

This novel, set in 1930 in a fictional mid-size city, reads like a Greek tragedy, as fate and Julian's own fatal flaws combine to bring about his downfall. That the writing is very sparse and straight-forward, with a combination of slangy conversation and mundane details, makes the epic-like tragedy even more dramatic.

Although not as well known, this novel of the early 20th century is worthy to stand alongside the works of Hemingway and Fitzgerald.",1,"[-40.175495100103475, 8.219350855615456, -1.855412435398374, 0.08072547818099562, -4.983115431936292]",8.219350855615456

I loved this book! In the past year, Ive become such a fan of Sarah Ballances work, and The Millionaires Gamble once again showed me the reason why. Her gift of balancing both intensity and humor is one of the things I love most about her writing. Her characters are always unique and well-layered, and her stories always compelling and entertaining.

In The Millionaires Gamble, Kennedy Price is on a quest to get Jagger Hamiltons DNA for a blood test to prove hes the father of her sisters baby. And yet, things don't go as smoothly as she hoped they might. Because she wasn't counting on being so taken with the man, of being so captivated and seduced. Not that she makes it easy for Jagger to seduce her, or to get to know her, either.

The enemies to lovers trope is one of my all time favorites to read because it holds such a great dynamic for the characters, and so much potential for their interactions. Ballance took a classic trope and made it her own in this book, creating a delightful story about two unlikely people caught up in the circumstances theyve somehow created for themselves. Its very much a story about choices, about making assumptions and judgments, about being able to trust ones own instincts, and learning to see the world through a different set of eyes.

If you're looking for a well-written, well-characterized, contemporary romance with angst, humor, passion, and a story capable of carrying you away for a while, check out The Millionaires Gamble by Sarah Ballance. Its a fantastic read, and perfect for anyone looking for a little romance and a little escape.",1,"[-50.89221842603838, 7.329644717194028, -5.197360207431812, -0.050251790890583514, -4.270045238972683]",7.329644717194028
12,"This was an incredibly sweet story about the ultimate forgiveness. About a man committing an act so heinous, and a woman finding it in her heart to see past the hurt and anger, and love that man.

At first I didn't know what to think about the premise. In 1944 a young girl's brutally raped in the Louisiana woods by three solders. Seven years later she unknowingly falls in love with one of her attackers. I figured once she found out the truth, that would be the end of the affair. I didn't see how it could possibly go any other way and I'd still like the story. But it did.

Now, I've never been in a situation such as Charlotte's, and I know some reviewers here had a real problem with the story, but I think because it was just purely fiction to me, I was able to enjoy it, and find it somewhat believable.

My only issue with the book that kept me from giving it five stars was the ending. I was pretty disappointed in how abruptly it ended. After reading the last paragraph I turned the page ready to devour the next chapter and was stunned that the book was over. I really would have liked to find out everyone's fate. For the most part I really liked the book and highly recommend it, though some may be extremely sensitive to it's content, and therefore should not read this.",1,"[-39.45232985435361, 7.1906657840821095, 4.9752553919830795, -2.5798854903411144, -4.08203054289571]",7.1906657840821095

With hilarious chapter headings (The World Cant Handle My Ninja, My Face Just Wont Shut Up, Im Like the Fat in a Cheese Stick) and an engaging & witty writing voice, DiMarco speaks to the heart of a woman and refreshes the soul. Each chapters Thoughts to Ponder help the authors personal insights become personal to the reader as well and would make great starting points for a small group discussion.

7,"that people would actually send some of the photos (like the cover photo) in for others to view (and ridicule!) There were some very strange pictures that I wouldn't want others to see if it was my family, but that's part of the fun!

I like the way the book is organized. The pictures are classified under different categories such as the family portrait, the vacation, weddings, and strange, not awkward. My favorite was the holidays category. It included many very funny Christmas, Easter, Halloween, and other holiday photos. The stories behind some of the photos were included, and I thought that was a great addition that really added to the humor of the photos. There were some stories included that didn't have photos to go with them, and I didn't think these were as funny. Also, some of the captions didn't seem to go with the photos -- or maybe I just didn't get all of the jokes.

After finishing this book, I decided to look at the website to see what it was like. I was disappointed to see many of the same photos that were shown in the book. Therefore, the book may seem repetitive to frequent visitors of the website. Other than that, it was a very interesting and hilarious book. And after reading this book, you may look back at your own family photos and think they're better than you thought. This would be a great gift idea, especially for a family member.",3,"[-47.48173925132658, -6.893252669998561, -1.8728165676998403, -1.3997219098832718, -2.509331571234615]",-1.3997219098832718

Our heroine is Melina and our hero is Rhys and Max (TWINS yes ladies TWINS)  Melina seeks help from Max to improve her bedroom skills because if she can do that than no more heartache.  The funny thing is she wants Rhys.  Ah now Rhys has always loved Melina but never acted on his feelings.  Funny right?!?

Jordan Marie has sent me on an emotional roller coaster AGAIN! This lady knows how to write a suspenseful MC book that will keep you hooked. I honestly didn't think she could make me fall for Torch since my obsession with Skull was so fierce but let me just say Torch was right up there.

The sexual chemistry between Torch and Katy is off the charts HOT! I loved these two together. Torch is on a mission to find Beth and Katy and bring them back safely to Skull but what Torch doesn't expect is to fall for Katy. I loved the banter between these two and the crazy sayings that Torch comes up with when he is aggravated will have you smiling. This is the second book in the trilogy and I can't wait to get my hands on the next one so we can finally get the conclusion to Skull and Beth. I would recommend this series to anyone who loves a a good MC book with a touch of suspense and some insanely HOT scenes between these two.",4,"[-54.871500193619966, -9.158174222222396, -1.9531935945563426, -2.551341828210661, -1.7960285459737149]",-1.7960285459737149

There are so many things I loved about this book...it was thorough, no gaps...the hot alpha male billionaire wasn't playboy who would have a different bimbo in his bed every night or week (very,very refreshing)...the descriptions when they were together gave me goosebumps, especially the first time they were in a limo (goosebumps among goosebumps...WOW)....Vivienne was a strong woman who was in control of her life but wanted a real man to control her in bed....Dominic was strong and patient and wanted Vivienne but played a sensual game with her (goosebumps again)....finally when they are together EXPLOSIVE. The ending was the best ending I have read in a long long time.....goosebumps again and eyes were a little misty as well.  KUDOS to Amelia Wilde!! Worth more than the 5 stars allowed!!

After reading so many books by this author I was really psyched to read Zoo. Something is affecting the animals. All of them. They rise up and turn their deadly attention on mankind. Sounds like fun to me.

And it was. I devoured it in a couple of hours. The only thing that slowed me down was pausing to savor each attack as it occurred. The characters were okay. Liked some more than others.

I have to admit, the main reason I wanted to read this was for the horror aspect. My imagination ran wild. How and why would it happen? How many ways could humans die and from what kinds of critters. I got my answers and had some fun. What kept it from being a killer story, Im not sure. Perhaps it bogged down in some areas. Too much character information in others.  Still well worth the read.

I own a copy. My review is voluntarily given.",3,"[-40.01651540817075, -5.742538831609773, -4.701162427559999, -2.520771048385601, -1.8416558394430584]",-1.8416558394430584
