There were some grammatical errors, but I am getting so used to seeing them that I actually don't see them as much as I did.  It was a nice romance with straight to gay sex, lust, love, Justin and Calder dealing with Justin's Asperger's Disease, violence, stalking, deception, and danger.  It was a good story and I enjoyed it.  I love Sierra's writing and await her next book with excitement.",4,"[-54.77302494192167, -6.103080005359466, -3.257668487915537, -0.1870173658265642, -2.008701185324866]",-0.1870173658265642
33,"This was a great read.  Our heroine is Melina and our hero is Rhys and Max (TWINS yes ladies TWINS)  Melina seeks help from Max to improve her bedroom skills because if she can do that than no more heartache.  The funny thing is she wants Rhys.  Ah now Rhys has always loved Melina but never acted on his feelings.  Funny right?!?  I could tell you more, but in my true style I want you to love the book and discover this story like I did 1 page at a time.  Good job Virna now I will continue in this series.",4,"[-64.84940264429966, -6.628003590720979, -6.609713636132596, -0.2479631847360243, -1.0601715921425798]",-0.2479631847360243
51,"This is the first time that I've read anything by this author and I am already anxious for the next book in this series.  Ella's mother has died and she never knew her father. To survive, she has been stripping at night and going to school during the day.  Her father's best friend has been searching for her, finds her and takes her to his home with his five sons.

The boys are rich, spoiled, and rule everything in their school and social circle. They don't want Ella there at all and are very unwelcoming. There's plenty of angst, arguments, and eventually friendship and love.

The next book is going to have a lot of questions to answer but I am looking forward to it.",3,"[-57.345142514081715, -0.2769035987312414, -4.440626491575655, -0.8143764243264418, -1.1435988648117923]",-0.2769035987312414
14,"This was a really quick and really fun read. I can honestly say that I could not put it down. It had a very addictive quality to it. One where from the moment I began, I just needed to know where the story was going and where the characters would end up. The characters are likable and they have great chemistry.

Julie and Daniel are great together and the connection is instantaneous. I really liked them together and I liked their relationship. Julie is looking to explore her submissive tendencies and Daniel is an experienced Domm. However, they meet each other without either one of them knowing those things and I liked that they gravitated toward each other naturally. Julie is a great character; she is strong and spunky and is finally giving in to something that she has always been curious about. Daniel is also a great guy. He is of course a dominant alpha male but he never crosses the line into cruel. He is a great guy and always has Julies best needs at heart.

I think what I really enjoyed about this novel is that it was more than just Julie and Daniels relationship and the exploration of that. That is of course a huge part of the story and what it is centered on, but its also about Julie coming to terms with who she is as a person. Just as Julie is beginning to accept herself and her nature, she comes face to face with the dangerous side of this lifestyle. Her best friend is seriously injured in a scene gone wrong and it shakes Julie. It makes her question everything and she cant seem to separate Daniel from what happened with her friend. It was interesting to see the flip side of things and see how it made Julie doubt everything. At the same time though, I felt like it enabled Julie to know exactly what she was doing and getting into and if she can trust trust Daniel knowing all that it may just make their relationship stronger.

I also really liked the secondary characters, especially Dena and Cole. Dena becomes a great friend for Julie, and Cole just seems fun. Im hoping they each get their own books because Id love to see more of them.

Seduced By Fire was a really steamy and really engaging read. I loved how it was so easy to read and get lost in. It was a great escape for a few hours.",1,"[-59.52733053849306, -0.6963152698949155, -6.1428878345519085, -1.599619863304328, -0.5051454661085648]",-0.5051454661085648
64,"What an AMAZING book by Amelia Wilde, from beginning to end there wasn't a thing I would change about the story or second guess it. There are so many things I loved about this book...it was thorough, no gaps...the hot alpha male billionaire wasn't playboy who would have a different bimbo in his bed every night or week (very,very refreshing)...the descriptions when they were together gave me goosebumps, especially the first time they were in a limo (goosebumps among goosebumps...WOW)....Vivienne was a strong woman who was in control of her life but wanted a real man to control her in bed....Dominic was strong and patient and wanted Vivienne but played a sensual game with her (goosebumps again)....finally when they are together EXPLOSIVE. The ending was the best ending I have read in a long long time.....goosebumps again and eyes were a little misty as well.  KUDOS to Amelia Wilde!! Worth more than the 5 stars allowed!!

71,"I really liked this first in a new Catherine Vale series. I have  read many of her other books and this one continued with her great imaginative plots, weird characters and great view of the paranormal world. In her travels through the different Wonderland realms our heroine, Alicia, meets up with so many awesomely eccentric folk-- I loved the mix of supernatural/otherworldly characters. I especially liked Alicia--she was no wimp and really concerned about finding what happened to her missing parents. The only drawback for me was that this was a re-do or cover version of Alice in Wonderland--I'm not much for re-telling those well-known tales. But CV does do it with panache and this one is also well-done. Great read!

47,"I was expecting your standard faire shifter book from the blurb, but this has a lot more.  There is magic, fae folk, hidden realms and lots of peril!  It is well written, although would have been even better if there had been more detail on what the main characters were thinking or how they were feeling.

I liked Morgan (the heroine) she was tough, a loner, and didn't gladly accept finding out she was a wolf shifter.  I did think it odd that she didn't question being taken to the 13 Moons Clan, but then considering the few days she had been through, perhaps that is forgivable.  Zak is a very mysterious character and it takes the whole book to get to know all of him.  There were lots of good/interesting supporting characters, along with a very detailed and action-packed plot.

This can be read as a stand-alone but the very last few chapters set up enough of a mystery that I will be waiting for the next book.",3,"[-54.5377277193487, -8.575052525295701, -3.9086459010919414, -1.6819343301330993, -1.4636914239846903]",-1.4636914239846903

This has an LED light and it is so much better, it is very lightweight and it fits on my Kindle perfectly, even with the cover on it. I did not get it from Amazon but it is the same light and I got the silver or ""graphite"" colored one.
