26,"All kidding aside, a detective story with a K9 companion is a plus in my book. Actually in this book too. By itself, the story was good enough but I got a kick out of the way the dog, Sirius, was depicted.

Michael Gideon, a detective in the LAPD, and his partner Sirius had been severely injured in a fire while apprehending a serial murderer leaving both of them and the murderer scarred but with a strange connection. This gets covered repeatedly in the book. Thus story covers the solving of two mysterious deaths and also, more or less, the rehabilitation of Detective Gideon. I'm not doing justice to the story in this review. It was a good one and I'd recommend it.",3,"[-34.4218317319909, -8.097405159408536, -8.659960710130008, 3.1328433152646524, -7.469116370347232]",3.1328433152646524
1,"Any time you have one of those days when everything goes wrong, consider the case of the hero of this classic novel.

Julian English seems to have it all: He is the son of one of the city's most prominent men, is president of the Cadillac dealership, is married to a beautiful and intelligent woman, and socializes with the young Country Club set. And then one night, with a bit too much bootleg liquor inside him, he throws a drink in the face of a ""friend"" (who happens to have loaned his business $20,000) who is irritatingly telling long-winded stories. Julian's wife is upset and embarrassed and they argue. And the next night he further humiliates her by again drinking too much and apparently seducing a mobster's mistress right in front of her and their friends. And things go downhill from there.

This novel, set in 1930 in a fictional mid-size city, reads like a Greek tragedy, as fate and Julian's own fatal flaws combine to bring about his downfall. That the writing is very sparse and straight-forward, with a combination of slangy conversation and mundane details, makes the epic-like tragedy even more dramatic.

Although not as well known, this novel of the early 20th century is worthy to stand alongside the works of Hemingway and Fitzgerald.",4,"[-9.942672193805993, 2.887329876486927, -6.403998017714616, -0.022215796424269296, -6.179739986224041]",2.887329876486927

This story is interesting but sad when the reality of our personal

If my boots were any larger, however, I doubt I could have gotten them to fit.  The thickness of the soles probably adds a half size.  So I would say that if your shoe/boot size is larger than a 7, you might want to consider getting a medium.",3,"[-2.6352848751943787, -12.050281960309132, -10.750661470789602, 2.836521209331067, -3.5150261324214886]",2.836521209331067
12,"This was an incredibly sweet story about the ultimate forgiveness. About a man committing an act so heinous, and a woman finding it in her heart to see past the hurt and anger, and love that man.

At first I didn't know what to think about the premise. In 1944 a young girl's brutally raped in the Louisiana woods by three solders. Seven years later she unknowingly falls in love with one of her attackers. I figured once she found out the truth, that would be the end of the affair. I didn't see how it could possibly go any other way and I'd still like the story. But it did.

Now, I've never been in a situation such as Charlotte's, and I know some reviewers here had a real problem with the story, but I think because it was just purely fiction to me, I was able to enjoy it, and find it somewhat believable.

My only issue with the book that kept me from giving it five stars was the ending. I was pretty disappointed in how abruptly it ended. After reading the last paragraph I turned the page ready to devour the next chapter and was stunned that the book was over. I really would have liked to find out everyone's fate. For the most part I really liked the book and highly recommend it, though some may be extremely sensitive to it's content, and therefore should not read this.",3,"[-9.915124677333193, 2.5574254595082877, 0.028405522088123192, -2.688126251403094, -5.150069175650808]",2.5574254595082877

I loved this book! In the past year, Ive become such a fan of Sarah Ballances work, and The Millionaires Gamble once again showed me the reason why. Her gift of balancing both intensity and humor is one of the things I love most about her writing. Her characters are always unique and well-layered, and her stories always compelling and entertaining.

In The Millionaires Gamble, Kennedy Price is on a quest to get Jagger Hamiltons DNA for a blood test to prove hes the father of her sisters baby. And yet, things don't go as smoothly as she hoped they might. Because she wasn't counting on being so taken with the man, of being so captivated and seduced. Not that she makes it easy for Jagger to seduce her, or to get to know her, either.

The enemies to lovers trope is one of my all time favorites to read because it holds such a great dynamic for the characters, and so much potential for their interactions. Ballance took a classic trope and made it her own in this book, creating a delightful story about two unlikely people caught up in the circumstances theyve somehow created for themselves. Its very much a story about choices, about making assumptions and judgments, about being able to trust ones own instincts, and learning to see the world through a different set of eyes.

If you're looking for a well-written, well-characterized, contemporary romance with angst, humor, passion, and a story capable of carrying you away for a while, check out The Millionaires Gamble by Sarah Ballance. Its a fantastic read, and perfect for anyone looking for a little romance and a little escape.",4,"[-23.088567559137072, 2.1585796004107145, -9.778713849486007, 0.29906333913102223, -5.733297984712112]",2.1585796004107145

Ace left his band after he received a call that he mother was very ill. He have already been having problems with his manager and other group members so when his mother passed he took on a new look and went out to create a new life that isn't a celebrity.
He found a trailer in a small town in Ohio and that's where he found iris. The women that changed everything for him and who he fell in love with. I am so happy that she created a male character with so much emotion. I just love it when a man really loves a women and can cry without any hesitation.
