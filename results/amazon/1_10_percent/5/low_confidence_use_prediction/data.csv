You boil water, add the Idahoan Mashed Potatoes' flakes and stir till thick. That's it! But the taste, it's unbelievable. These are absolutely fantastic. I always buy their various varieties. I love the Four Cheese variety. These are my favorite. I cannot say enough about Idahoan Mashed Potatoes.

48,"Carter and Emily are great characters! Carter, the Bodyguard and Emily, choreographer to her famous friend.

Both are led by fear. Fear of a stalker. Fear of being discovered. Protecting yourself. Protecting the ones you love.

Together, they are so darn sweet, romantic, passionate. But their fears overshadow everything. Valid fears.

I loved Emily's take charge attitude while wielding a bat. I was cheering her on! And when things got tough, she fought back and did not give up. She took control.

Carter was a wee bit slower to go after what he wanted and it took a surly but highly intelligent teenager to shed some light and point out the obvious.

These two have such capacity to love that it was truly heart warming. I was in a race to the end, the HEA, but then as I was down to the last few chapters I had to stop because I did t want it to end!",2,"[-61.515440265439736, -8.88936746567925, 0.8366878603587456, -2.5342719973504453, 0.10076717650097189]",0.8366878603587456

71,"I really liked this first in a new Catherine Vale series. I have  read many of her other books and this one continued with her great imaginative plots, weird characters and great view of the paranormal world. In her travels through the different Wonderland realms our heroine, Alicia, meets up with so many awesomely eccentric folk-- I loved the mix of supernatural/otherworldly characters. I especially liked Alicia--she was no wimp and really concerned about finding what happened to her missing parents. The only drawback for me was that this was a re-do or cover version of Alice in Wonderland--I'm not much for re-telling those well-known tales. But CV does do it with panache and this one is also well-done. Great read! I voluntarily read and reviewed an ARC of this book.",2,"[-56.08642289272762, -10.306495403988457, 0.7379089657530613, -2.6418064923965052, -1.2735746245830788]",0.7379089657530613
49,"Yet another great story AND GREAT RECIPES, from Joanne Fluke.
I have been following the adventures of Hannah Swensen since the very first one and they just keep getting better and better.
This is a Christmas themed story and has some quirky bits because of the holiday.
I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It is shorter than most of the other books, a quick, enjoyable read just perfect for
this hot summer day because all of the snow made me feel cooler.
The characters are mostly the ones with which we are familiar and they behave the way we expect them to so it is very like revisiting a home town that many of us recall from years ago.",4,"[-59.10525400920257, -18.867686544450443, 0.4511053273105279, -0.8675866875669486, 0.47659629779125123]",0.47659629779125123

99,"WOW is this an amazing gaming mouse! My daughter actually has a youtube channel where she plays games and talks as she's playing.  We upgraded her mouse and immediately noticed a huge difference.  Her favorite thing about the mouse is that there is no bright red light coming from the bottom, so when the cat knocks it over at night, there is no shining in the room!  The weights are a nice touch but mostly unnecessary for common use, but again they are a nice touch to make the mouse as comfortable as possible.",4,"[-36.197773437417375, -22.896683406674192, -2.1112706135405332, -0.1033508251705445, 0.40176527953775176]",0.40176527953775176

I got a sneak peek  into the  Demonica Underworld and I was just fascinated. The romance  was perfect  but  my favourite part was just cross over itself omg I never thought I would see Big Tag in some of the situation I saw him into in this book. It was amazing and iyou're wondering if you should pick this book up  the answer is yes pick it up right now",3,"[-46.722502505802396, -10.829933544933223, -2.730150671245493, 0.2794387086247557, -2.8379163620889454]",0.2794387086247557
