55,"WE REAP WHAT WE SOW

This story is interesting but sad when the reality of our personal
actions and lack of morals is sending this country and many others right down the septic tanks.

Whenever our pleasures are obtained from the pain of others there will not be any light at the end of the tunnel.

It's as if you are there alongside the characters as they laugh out loud, as the tears flow down both of yours cheeks, as they realize they and their lives aren't perfect yet it's all okay! I will look forward to continuing this journey with this group of friends that are family.",4,"[-46.50099322116824, -19.62574058032518, -0.6707197635042794, -9.958753713476446, 4.418541023473146]",4.418541023473146

31,"I just loved their story. Two people who falls in love and have so much in common fight for what they know is right for them. I am glad that this story didn't leave me with any cliffhangers and it ended while.
Ace left his band after he received a call that he mother was very ill. He have already been having problems with his manager and other group members so when his mother passed he took on a new look and went out to create a new life that isn't a celebrity.
He found a trailer in a small town in Ohio and that's where he found iris. The women that changed everything for him and who he fell in love with. I am so happy that she created a male character with so much emotion. I just love it when a man really loves a women and can cry without any hesitation.
You have to read the story to understand their love for each other and the issues that tried to come between them.",4,"[-54.252406602139835, -15.170597453692396, -6.819743311945222, -6.140409212326999, 4.07622381973034]",4.07622381973034
