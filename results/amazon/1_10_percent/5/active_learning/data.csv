71,"I really liked this first in a new Catherine Vale series. I have  read many of her other books and this one continued with her great imaginative plots, weird characters and great view of the paranormal world. In her travels through the different Wonderland realms our heroine, Alicia, meets up with so many awesomely eccentric folk-- I loved the mix of supernatural/otherworldly characters. I especially liked Alicia--she was no wimp and really concerned about finding what happened to her missing parents. The only drawback for me was that this was a re-do or cover version of Alice in Wonderland--I'm not much for re-telling those well-known tales. But CV does do it with panache and this one is also well-done. Great read! I voluntarily read and reviewed an ARC of this book.",4,"[-56.08642289272762, -3.500623545183962, -5.710345404191809, -4.4085476342522565, -0.07233026119051372]",-0.07233026119051372
15,"This gripping novel is set against the backdrop of the Gulf War of 1991
It is jam packed with suspense and action and we never know who will survive and who wont
We see into the inner workings of the governments and secret services of the USA , UK and Israel
As well as into the chilling terror of Saddam  Hussein's dictatorship and get a glimpse of Saddam's evil mind as well as the unbelievable cruelty of Hussein  and his minions such as the head of his secret police Amn -al -Amn  Omar Khatib and General Abdullah Kadiri , men who delight in the most horrific cruelties on those who get in their way. These tortures and deaths are described in a way that enables us to feel for the vicitms
The heroes of the story include Mike Martin , a SAS agent working in Baghdad and Don Walker , a US Air Force Fighter Pilot
I was a bit disappointed about the way he dealt with the MOSSAD operations in Vienna. As an admirer of the MOSSAD Id have hoped that their antics would have been more heroic and gripping than his story of a MOSSAD agent romancing a lonely and dowdy female bank worker in order to get bank secrets and then abandoning her
The central message of the novel-outlined in the postscript is the terrible danger the West is putting herself and the world in by selling dangerous and unconventional weapons to Arab and Third World dictatorships",3,"[-45.74863959070158, -2.281384562629401, -2.0860449772163885, -0.2505629226851531, -0.9584759397246294]",-0.2505629226851531
33,"This was a great read.  Our heroine is Melina and our hero is Rhys and Max (TWINS yes ladies TWINS)  Melina seeks help from Max to improve her bedroom skills because if she can do that than no more heartache.  The funny thing is she wants Rhys.  Ah now Rhys has always loved Melina but never acted on his feelings.  Funny right?!?  I could tell you more, but in my true style I want you to love the book and discover this story like I did 1 page at a time.  Good job Virna now I will continue in this series.",3,"[-64.84940264429966, -4.203001625946499, -2.6726662896050843, -3.352783876761028, -0.27334342700512304]",-0.27334342700512304
20,"I really enjoyed Suzy's book, her writing is enjoyable and to the point. She really holds nothing back and shares with her readers generously from her own life journey. The 10-10-10 process consists of making decisions by thinking through the results of those decisions in three time frames, 10 minutes, 10 months, and 10 years. This represents understanding the implications of what you do in the short term, mid-term, and long term time horizons. This could save readers lots of trouble and heart ache by carefully following this process with your priorities and values as filters and guides. While this is common sense most of us abandon common sense in the heat of ego, emotions, and family drama. After reading this book you will come away with a structured way to make decisions that is much better than simply writing goals or writing down pros and cons. You will project out how your life is like in three time frames if you decide to take a certain path. I have read hundreds of self improvement books and I love this one for its simplicity and powerful message. It even showed me I am to long term focused, making decisions using the ten year perspective to much and neglecting the present. You will not regret buying this book and following its recommendations. It truly is a life-transforming idea.",4,"[-47.600920365549015, -8.060806584734646, -0.3239735766298413, -1.5307695001739856, -0.5002132530337009]",-0.3239735766298413

Jordan Marie has sent me on an emotional roller coaster AGAIN! This lady knows how to write a suspenseful MC book that will keep you hooked. I honestly didn't think she could make me fall for Torch since my obsession with Skull was so fierce but let me just say Torch was right up there.

The sexual chemistry between Torch and Katy is off the charts HOT! I loved these two together. Torch is on a mission to find Beth and Katy and bring them back safely to Skull but what Torch doesn't expect is to fall for Katy. I loved the banter between these two and the crazy sayings that Torch comes up with when he is aggravated will have you smiling. This is the second book in the trilogy and I can't wait to get my hands on the next one so we can finally get the conclusion to Skull and Beth. I would recommend this series to anyone who loves a a good MC book with a touch of suspense and some insanely HOT scenes between these two.",4,"[-54.871500193619966, -6.729686679751393, -1.4670192870741063, -3.1388181959129264, -0.39890885589857106]",-0.39890885589857106
7,"that people would actually send some of the photos (like the cover photo) in for others to view (and ridicule!) There were some very strange pictures that I wouldn't want others to see if it was my family, but that's part of the fun!

I like the way the book is organized. The pictures are classified under different categories such as the family portrait, the vacation, weddings, and strange, not awkward. My favorite was the holidays category. It included many very funny Christmas, Easter, Halloween, and other holiday photos. The stories behind some of the photos were included, and I thought that was a great addition that really added to the humor of the photos. There were some stories included that didn't have photos to go with them, and I didn't think these were as funny. Also, some of the captions didn't seem to go with the photos -- or maybe I just didn't get all of the jokes.

After finishing this book, I decided to look at the website to see what it was like. I was disappointed to see many of the same photos that were shown in the book. Therefore, the book may seem repetitive to frequent visitors of the website. Other than that, it was a very interesting and hilarious book. And after reading this book, you may look back at your own family photos and think they're better than you thought. This would be a great gift idea, especially for a family member.",3,"[-47.48173925132658, -4.4552044347377855, -0.5288249470911945, -1.5872120907480978, -1.290712728653622]",-0.5288249470911945
3,"I read this back when it was first released. Actually, I won an ARC copy with three alternative covers. Pretty cool.

After reading so many books by this author I was really psyched to read Zoo. Something is affecting the animals. All of them. They rise up and turn their deadly attention on mankind. Sounds like fun to me.

And it was. I devoured it in a couple of hours. The only thing that slowed me down was pausing to savor each attack as it occurred. The characters were okay. Liked some more than others.

I have to admit, the main reason I wanted to read this was for the horror aspect. My imagination ran wild. How and why would it happen? How many ways could humans die and from what kinds of critters. I got my answers and had some fun. What kept it from being a killer story, Im not sure. Perhaps it bogged down in some areas. Too much character information in others.  Still well worth the read.

I own a copy. My review is voluntarily given.",3,"[-40.01651540817075, -3.0699307800458446, -3.2378550881487547, -2.8562534175385124, -0.9785915825306002]",-0.9785915825306002
22,"Michael and Savannah Ivey are more than a little stunned when one of their clients is so angry that he attacks them in their clinic. Not long after the attack, the client turns up dead. All evidence is pointing Michaels way. The dead body was even discovered in the Iveys clinic. With the help of their good friend, Detective Craig Sledge, they set out to find the real killer and find out who could be framing Michael.

To add to the excitement, Savannahs sister Brianna comes to town and pairs up with the Iveys vet tech, Bud. The two get closer and closer with each day.

For a cat lover like me, what can be better than a cat cozy mystery? The klepto cat is Savannahs Rags and its a good thing he likes to take other peoples belongings since it often helps in solving mysteries.  Once again, Rags talents come in handy. With a little help from Rags, they might just find out who the culprit is.

I really enjoy this series and it has some of the best book covers Ive ever seen featuring cats. This book was a bit different as it was more like two books in one. The first book was a cozy mystery which was solved approximately half way through the book. The rest of the book had nothing to do with the mystery. It was more like a romance novel. Not that there is anything wrong with romances. Romance is my second favorite genre. However, I was a bit surprised that the first part of the book had nothing to do with the second part, except that the same characters were involved. I almost thought it was a preview for the next book, but it wasnt.

It didn't really matter as I was interested in the entire book and all the characters. The Iveys are the main characters throughout the whole book. They are real people who could be your average neighbor. They are likeable characters who readers will truly care about.  In fact, most of the secondary characters are likeable as well.

Overall, a sweet mystery and romance with no sex or violence. The perfect way to spend a quiet afternoon.",3,"[-56.8326009179161, -4.576526077127506, -8.57648933277458, -1.0626358922893864, -1.3726647894869082]",-1.0626358922893864
