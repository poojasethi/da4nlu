33,"Dallas Sykes is an heir to a multi-billion dollar fortune, infamous playboy, and way more than he seems. His notoriously hedonistic lifestyle is perfect camouflage for him to covertly accomplish things that really matter to him. A horrific past drives him to practice the art of distraction publicly while his true agenda plays out in secret.

Jane Martin, an author, shares a complicated past with Dallas that deeply bonds them but keeps them apart. They've struggled for years to maintain a distance but their resistance is crumbling.

Love, healing, understanding and disastrous consequences are the some of the many rewards and costs of Dallas and Jane coming together. Secrets and history carry stumbling blocks. Staying apart hasn't worked out well for either of them. They have to decide if they're strong enough to withstand the bad to find the good.

This book starts out overly dramatic and confusing, but improved when it veered away from international intrigue and into more personal territory, cutting to the chase. The story was at its best when dealing with Dallas, Jane, and their experiences and resulting issues.

There were a lot of times I was frustrated with this book but it came together and I liked it. I'm looking forward to reading the next two books and seeing where it all goes. There are a lot of questions to be answered and, I suspect, some surprises coming.

This trilogy will appeal to readers who enjoy stepbrother type romances.",2,"[-45.11131932765439, -2.7725106294745796, -0.7018403039319201, -3.179863101150716, -2.161340107268492]",-0.7018403039319201

I really hate to read other people's interpretation of a book, it is always the summary which draws me in and  the part of the summary that caught me and made me get the book,  were...""A boy, his sister, and her psychopathic roommate. When Katherine Langleys roommate, Emma, disappears from a house party on New Years Day, the only evidence left is a single set of footprints in the snow leading down to a deserted dock."" Oh, Yeah!!! had to find out the answer to that and rarely am I disappointed by my choices!!!

26,"After reading the first book in the Neverwinter Saga, Gauntylgrym, I was compelled to pick up Neverwinter immediately.  The series is fast paced, action packed, full of tremendously interesting characters and great villians.  After being a Drizzt fan for over a decade, I am excited to find myself staying up all night reading on to find out what happens next.

Neverwinter fleshes out several of the secondary conflicts developed throughout Gauntylgrym while introducing and developing several new characters.  There's no ""cookie-cutter"" Drizzt plots and action here, everything is fresh and exciting.  Drizzt has finally begun to evolve (mature) into a more complex character and reveals quite a few of his own weaknesses and flaws in the process. This makes him all the more compelling as we no longer sense he's completely invulnerable to anything that comes his way. I thoroughly enjoyed Neverwinter and highly, highly recommend it!",3,"[-49.00848575102424, -9.695397128821096, -2.160182162777426, -0.8669028450151878, -2.729312746675678]",-0.8669028450151878

The characters are all interesting and flawed people, somewhat like those in a Le Carre novel.

This book was different than I was expecting, but in a really great way. I think, at least for me, when you think of a book set in the art world, you expect them to be a little snooty and the characters were anything but...Tobias is really intense, in a way that keeps Zara, and everyone around him, on their toes. I loved it, I loved the twists and turns, and I loved the reveal, although I think there were enough clues that I wasn't surprised in the least. But, if you aren't paying attention, they are subtle, and you will miss them, if that makes any sense.

Zara and Tobias have a fantastic first meeting, and I loved this book from that point on. I loved that their first meeting wasn't perfect, it wasn't with unicorns and rainbows, but rather felt like a real life situation a number of us have been in....a slightly embarrassing moment that is then witnessed by someone else.

As this is the first book in a connected trilogy, there is a lot of time spent setting up the events, and the characters, so they are able to move through all of the books. But, it was balanced well with action, and scenes with Zara and Tobias that you felt like the story had momentum.

This is my first title by this author, who I initially heard of at a panel discussion and thought the books, and the idea behind them seemed interesting. I am definitely glad I requested this book and I am looking forward to the other 2 in the series.

I recommend this title.",4,"[-57.7863706552154, -4.37407558102327, -2.134508965828369, -3.466721847582899, -1.220549414727156]",-1.220549414727156

35,"Graham Hancock is known for writing massive bestsellers that advance the theory that an advanced civilization flourished at the end of the last Ice Age, at at time when orthodox historians and archaeologists believe that the human race was restricted to small bands of hunter-gatherers barely clinging to existence.  His first book on this subject was Fingerprints of the Gods, published about twenty years ago, and Magicians of the Gods is a sequel that supplies an explanation for the question the earlier work couldn't answer: ""If there was such an early civilization, what happened to it?"" Hancock now believes and sets forth the theory that about 12,800 years ago the Earth was struck by a comet which disintegrated over the Northern Hemisphere, causing catastrophic flooding and a rapid rise in  sea levels over the entire planet.  The advanced civilization, which Hancock believes may have been located in submerged areas in and around the modern nation of Indonesia, was lost in this catastrophe, but survivors managed to escape and flee to other areas, teaching indigenous peoples the rudiments of agriculture, metallurgy, and other skills that eventually led to new civilizations in Egypt, the Middle East, the Americas, and elsewhere.

Hancock is an engaging and enthusiastic writer and researcher, and he has amassed a substantial amount of information to support his theories.  Of course those theories are controversial and liable to be dismissed by the ""professionals."" I think that would be a mistake, because Hancock has identified some intriguing similarities between cultures which developed at far removes. This isn't to say there couldn't be other, more prosaic, explanations, of course, such as cultural diffusion and other forms of contact.  His comet theory sounds plausible and deserves not to be dismissed out of hand, as do his warnings of a possible encounter with pieces of the same comet within the next few decades.

I enjoyed Magicians of the Gods as I have most of Hancock's earlier works.  He is a tireless traveler and researcher, and his descriptions of his journeys to long forgotten or ignored sites in South America, the Middle East, and Indonesia are vivid and beautifully accompanied by numerous illustrations.  While I am still not convinced that some hidden Hall of Records containing long lost information is about to be discovered under a pyramid somewhere, I do hope that Hancock continues his research and writing for many years to come.",3,"[-31.165214663750007, -11.61492865094941, -2.2774101137457663, -1.6988652400010007, -2.4302408036298466]",-1.6988652400010007
