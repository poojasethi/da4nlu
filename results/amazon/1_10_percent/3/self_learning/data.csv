78,"This fun, Banana-Leaf-print DII 100% POLYESTER TABLECLOTH FOR OUTDOOR USE (60 Round, Seats 4 People) is an outdoor tablecloth that can be used indoors--the fabric looks that good!  Although it's 100% polyester, the fabric feels somewhat similar to the fabric in DIIs traditional 100% cotton tablecloths.  The fabric is spill-proof because it is very tightly woven from polyester thread.  It doesn't feel at all like plastic or oilcloth.

The bold Banana Leaf pattern is printed on, so the reverse side of the tablecloth is white.  The construction is excellent, with a nicely turned and topstitched hem.  The tablecloth is machine washable.",4,"[-42.70653409562003, -16.74231789019538, -8.322813591257036, -4.061649565730516, 4.24434809689319]",4.24434809689319
5,"This is a magnificent and beautifully written book set in post WWII Germany. Three incredible women, all widows, and their children brought together and each with their own strengths as well as flaws, learn to survive in the terrible aftermath of war. Gripping from the first pages to the end. Fantastic and well-researched historical fiction. I highly recommend this book.",4,"[-46.03092829033135, -16.71162701648529, -5.565095836154134, -5.103289517409867, 4.168231768345105]",4.168231768345105
92,"Way, way to subtle and dull film.  I totally understand why some critics called it boring.  It was.  Worst was there was no chemistry between Steve Carell and Keira Knightley which is crucial in a film like this that is depressing and goes no where.  You need something for the fans to hang on to.  Poor film, not entertaining.  This is one to pass on.",2,"[-37.89592093725508, -6.407447981318045, 3.8866729971457747, 2.586626944711055, -6.127315325815107]",3.8866729971457747
97,"I did a lot of research before buying my rowing machine, and I think this is the best one made.  It is not inexpensive, but it is worth every dollar.  This is quality all the way.  Rowing is a total body exercise, as well as being aerobic, so a rowing machine beats a treadmill, stationary bike, or elliptical machine hands down.  You will love this machine.",4,"[-40.44737047611612, -20.709966658179724, -9.183307967150238, -5.561675627073091, 3.752031319539972]",3.752031319539972

Archer is the ultimate hero. You will root for him from the very beginning! He is the definition of strength..He is kind...He is pure of heart. This story kind of reminded me of Beauty and the Beast, ultimately one of my favorite love stories.",4,"[-65.60606596666571, -16.54754134865395, -8.54259008289176, -2.9463750248236975, 3.111756447032572]",3.111756447032572

99,"Looks good but it's smaller than I'd expected for the price. It includes a Lex Luthor figure that can be used to  provide various actions . The eyes light up and open . The batteries are included which is a plus.  You or your child will definitely want to add more  characters , both additional villains and heroes for  more enjoyable play.  The Imiginext line is geared toward ages 3 to 8 . I suspect that by age 8 there are other DC  character lines more age appropriate but these are great for the younger kids.",4,"[-46.56959204094872, -29.69863790662906, -4.639295891062991, -3.9104332360284406, 2.642389685968163]",2.642389685968163
