45,"I had really high hopes for this book. When I purchased it, it had great reviews. I've read and enjoyed several things from this author in the past. It just sounded good.

Unfortunately, I was mostly let down.

First off, the plot was just all over the place. First it was basically an office place romance. And then it because this political thriller type that just wasn't well done. The chemistry between the main characters wasn't the least bit believable. I believed that Misty was infatuated with Domenico, but that was about it. His sudden change of heart just didn't ring true.

I didn't care for the character of Mindy at all. She was not just shy and awkward -- she was dangerously close to being one of those ""too stupid to live"" heroines that I can't stand. She got old fast. I just found her ridiculous and unlikeable.

I didn't mind Domenico as much. Yes, he was cold and ruthless, but he played the Alpha part well. I just didn't believe for a second that he loved Misty.

I considered buying the next book in the series, but have decided not to. I didn't care for the characters, nor the plot, so I know I'll be wasting my time. I'll try this author again in the future, hopefully.",3,"[-55.58626296814086, -5.6075993442035905, 0.5805425927967072, 0.12180194284032886, -0.47158155710302996]",0.5805425927967072

14,"This was rather detailed novel about leaks in the CIA and the attempt by the new Director to pin down those leaks.  The characters are all interesting and flawed people, somewhat like those in a Le Carre novel.  I kept thinking about what it must be like to work in an environment where everyone is keeping secrets from each other, some for security reasons and some against you, and there is no way to tell the difference.",4,"[-44.4468779927212, -3.2112188453164823, -8.001114726428643, 0.5628872470000036, 0.5002975699817745]",0.5628872470000036

35,"Graham Hancock is known for writing massive bestsellers that advance the theory that an advanced civilization flourished at the end of the last Ice Age, at at time when orthodox historians and archaeologists believe that the human race was restricted to small bands of hunter-gatherers barely clinging to existence.  His first book on this subject was Fingerprints of the Gods, published about twenty years ago, and Magicians of the Gods is a sequel that supplies an explanation for the question the earlier work couldn't answer: ""If there was such an early civilization, what happened to it?"" Hancock now believes and sets forth the theory that about 12,800 years ago the Earth was struck by a comet which disintegrated over the Northern Hemisphere, causing catastrophic flooding and a rapid rise in  sea levels over the entire planet.  The advanced civilization, which Hancock believes may have been located in submerged areas in and around the modern nation of Indonesia, was lost in this catastrophe, but survivors managed to escape and flee to other areas, teaching indigenous peoples the rudiments of agriculture, metallurgy, and other skills that eventually led to new civilizations in Egypt, the Middle East, the Americas, and elsewhere.

Hancock is an engaging and enthusiastic writer and researcher, and he has amassed a substantial amount of information to support his theories.  Of course those theories are controversial and liable to be dismissed by the ""professionals."" I think that would be a mistake, because Hancock has identified some intriguing similarities between cultures which developed at far removes. This isn't to say there couldn't be other, more prosaic, explanations, of course, such as cultural diffusion and other forms of contact.  His comet theory sounds plausible and deserves not to be dismissed out of hand, as do his warnings of a possible encounter with pieces of the same comet within the next few decades.

I enjoyed Magicians of the Gods as I have most of Hancock's earlier works.  He is a tireless traveler and researcher, and his descriptions of his journeys to long forgotten or ignored sites in South America, the Middle East, and Indonesia are vivid and beautifully accompanied by numerous illustrations.  While I am still not convinced that some hidden Hall of Records containing long lost information is about to be discovered under a pyramid somewhere, I do hope that Hancock continues his research and writing for many years to come.",4,"[-31.165214663750007, -10.180705896326154, -5.591393033917368, 0.20446189179516028, -1.0486897003114017]",0.20446189179516028

I loved how Regina decides to take her life back after a break-up, that she really didn't see coming. While out to dinner, her ex and his new thing arrive. She finishes and leaves and goes to bar where she meets Beck and the sparks fly. The journey that Beck and Regina experience will bring tears to your eyes, but it is a well written book.

13,"Written in a flinty, hyper minimalist style (3 word descriptive sentences, an abundance of terse dialogue, haiku-esque layouts that drip off the pages) this is a darkly satisfying near future cyber-noir with serviceable world-building that is briskly absorbed and with open ended sequel possibilities that will delight those looking to continue the ride.

While the cyberpunk influences are obvious Adam Sternbergh doesn't bog down the narrative with an abundance of techno-patter and instead utilizes the trappings of a decaying dystopia and the application of virtual reality more as a window dressing to ply mood and tone on an otherwise fairly standard 'hitman with a moral dilemma' type crime noir. Nothing too heavy here but the combination of two well worn genres are well executed and presented entertainingly enough.",1,"[-37.48258381132075, -0.8365182324526668, -5.2145051874010715, -0.035625118627000796, -1.1104744566838627]",-0.035625118627000796

33,"Dallas Sykes is an heir to a multi-billion dollar fortune, infamous playboy, and way more than he seems. His notoriously hedonistic lifestyle is perfect camouflage for him to covertly accomplish things that really matter to him. A horrific past drives him to practice the art of distraction publicly while his true agenda plays out in secret.

Jane Martin, an author, shares a complicated past with Dallas that deeply bonds them but keeps them apart. They've struggled for years to maintain a distance but their resistance is crumbling.

Love, healing, understanding and disastrous consequences are the some of the many rewards and costs of Dallas and Jane coming together. Secrets and history carry stumbling blocks. Staying apart hasn't worked out well for either of them. They have to decide if they're strong enough to withstand the bad to find the good.

This book starts out overly dramatic and confusing, but improved when it veered away from international intrigue and into more personal territory, cutting to the chase. The story was at its best when dealing with Dallas, Jane, and their experiences and resulting issues.

There were a lot of times I was frustrated with this book but it came together and I liked it. I'm looking forward to reading the next two books and seeing where it all goes. There are a lot of questions to be answered and, I suspect, some surprises coming.

This trilogy will appeal to readers who enjoy stepbrother type romances.",1,"[-45.11131932765439, -0.7148219736640851, -4.690329213829417, -0.9986602969153818, -0.6041460953710485]",-0.6041460953710485
