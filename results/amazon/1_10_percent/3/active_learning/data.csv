""These people already think I'm a heathen."" He's the type of man that loves to encourage his woman, ""that's it sweetheart."" He picked up the pace. ""Let me hear those sexy noises you make when you're turned on."" He's brutally honest, ""you're the only woman interviews room who makes me hard with just eye contact.""

26,"After reading the first book in the Neverwinter Saga, Gauntylgrym, I was compelled to pick up Neverwinter immediately.  The series is fast paced, action packed, full of tremendously interesting characters and great villians.  After being a Drizzt fan for over a decade, I am excited to find myself staying up all night reading on to find out what happens next.

Neverwinter fleshes out several of the secondary conflicts developed throughout Gauntylgrym while introducing and developing several new characters.  There's no ""cookie-cutter"" Drizzt plots and action here, everything is fresh and exciting.  Drizzt has finally begun to evolve (mature) into a more complex character and reveals quite a few of his own weaknesses and flaws in the process. This makes him all the more compelling as we no longer sense he's completely invulnerable to anything that comes his way. I thoroughly enjoyed Neverwinter and highly, highly recommend it!",4,"[-49.00848575102424, -4.683684914881775, -5.351524117755417, -2.0468741591315402, 0.31603482263297367]",0.31603482263297367
67,"Well, I didn't think she could top my favorite Russians and those Fairgood boys, but she's done it again. Theodora Taylor is an amazing writer and her characters truly resonate with readers. I get hooked in early (generally in chapter one) and this one was no different. Initially I didn't see Prin as being as strong as some of Taylor's other heroines, and I think she had a further way to go to understand herself, much less Zahir. Even though all her efforts in life were directed on behalf of others, she still believed she was living HER life. Zahir changed all that. She was drawn to him--and it seemed that she unconsciously recognized the 'true him' beneath his outward persona. Getting closer to him seemed to help her see herself more clearly--a good thing for anyone. And after months with Prin, Z was finally able to let himself be the man he was inside. Loved it--even though the book was darker in a different way than some of Taylor's others. Isn't it great that Theodora Taylor's books are always so dependably excellent! I voluntarily read and reviewed an ARC of this book.",4,"[-50.097541518272095, -1.8556267134168012, -6.135965420137833, -0.41681951526092087, 0.2630108956011361]",0.2630108956011361
35,"Graham Hancock is known for writing massive bestsellers that advance the theory that an advanced civilization flourished at the end of the last Ice Age, at at time when orthodox historians and archaeologists believe that the human race was restricted to small bands of hunter-gatherers barely clinging to existence.  His first book on this subject was Fingerprints of the Gods, published about twenty years ago, and Magicians of the Gods is a sequel that supplies an explanation for the question the earlier work couldn't answer: ""If there was such an early civilization, what happened to it?"" Hancock now believes and sets forth the theory that about 12,800 years ago the Earth was struck by a comet which disintegrated over the Northern Hemisphere, causing catastrophic flooding and a rapid rise in  sea levels over the entire planet.  The advanced civilization, which Hancock believes may have been located in submerged areas in and around the modern nation of Indonesia, was lost in this catastrophe, but survivors managed to escape and flee to other areas, teaching indigenous peoples the rudiments of agriculture, metallurgy, and other skills that eventually led to new civilizations in Egypt, the Middle East, the Americas, and elsewhere.

Hancock is an engaging and enthusiastic writer and researcher, and he has amassed a substantial amount of information to support his theories.  Of course those theories are controversial and liable to be dismissed by the ""professionals."" I think that would be a mistake, because Hancock has identified some intriguing similarities between cultures which developed at far removes. This isn't to say there couldn't be other, more prosaic, explanations, of course, such as cultural diffusion and other forms of contact.  His comet theory sounds plausible and deserves not to be dismissed out of hand, as do his warnings of a possible encounter with pieces of the same comet within the next few decades.

I enjoyed Magicians of the Gods as I have most of Hancock's earlier works.  He is a tireless traveler and researcher, and his descriptions of his journeys to long forgotten or ignored sites in South America, the Middle East, and Indonesia are vivid and beautifully accompanied by numerous illustrations.  While I am still not convinced that some hidden Hall of Records containing long lost information is about to be discovered under a pyramid somewhere, I do hope that Hancock continues his research and writing for many years to come.",3,"[-31.165214663750007, -4.726012481066766, -5.4158581347160055, -2.887632544592006, 0.25290383250055104]",0.25290383250055104
