92,"Way, way to subtle and dull film.  I totally understand why some critics called it boring.  It was.  Worst was there was no chemistry between Steve Carell and Keira Knightley which is crucial in a film like this that is depressing and goes no where.  You need something for the fans to hang on to.  Poor film, not entertaining.  This is one to pass on.",0,"[-37.89592093725508, -6.08201082778395, 0.9912086440740993, 3.5362037997025224, -7.234909698630993]",3.5362037997025224

Three incredible women, all widows, and their children brought together and each with their own strengths as well as flaws, learn to survive in the terrible aftermath of war. Gripping from the first pages to the end. Fantastic and well-researched historical fiction.

78,"This fun, Banana-Leaf-print DII 100% POLYESTER TABLECLOTH FOR OUTDOOR USE (60 Round, Seats 4 People) is an outdoor tablecloth that can be used indoors--the fabric looks that good!  Although it's 100% polyester, the fabric feels somewhat similar to the fabric in DIIs traditional 100% cotton tablecloths.  The fabric is spill-proof because it is very tightly woven from polyester thread.  It doesn't feel at all like plastic or oilcloth.

The bold Banana Leaf pattern is printed on, so the reverse side of the tablecloth is white.  The construction is excellent, with a nicely turned and topstitched hem.  The tablecloth is machine washable.",4,"[-42.70653409562003, -16.6824765207077, -10.530079333393282, -3.166326419837451, 3.1738782575793207]",3.1738782575793207

Rowing is a total body exercise, as well as being aerobic, so a rowing machine beats a treadmill, stationary bike, or elliptical machine hands down.  You will love this machine.",4,"[-40.44737047611612, -20.61289714054167, -11.355083299949694, -4.812160916763715, 2.8122643940330043]",2.8122643940330043
