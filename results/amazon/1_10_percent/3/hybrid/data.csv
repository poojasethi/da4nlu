15,"Pairing the psychic/medium world with murder makes for an unusual story. Does everyone have a double somewhere? Sheriff Dixon Noble discovers you can when someone reports seeing his missing and assumed dead wife.
Coulter's ability to have several sub-stories that she ultimately brings together under one umbrella at the finish is admirable. I thought it interesting how she helps us to explore the world of the psychic/medium through her character, Julie Ramson.  A very powerful FBI thriller.",1,"[-48.4725122024932, 4.9374890186625695, -3.91101275640722, -1.3537434062089264, -3.6717724913081042]",4.9374890186625695
5,"This is a magnificent and beautifully written book set in post WWII Germany. Three incredible women, all widows, and their children brought together and each with their own strengths as well as flaws, learn to survive in the terrible aftermath of war. Gripping from the first pages to the end. Fantastic and well-researched historical fiction. I highly recommend this book.",4,"[-46.03092829033135, -13.389956924744483, -5.565095836154134, -5.064826810199642, 4.579277479016053]",4.579277479016053
78,"This fun, Banana-Leaf-print DII 100% POLYESTER TABLECLOTH FOR OUTDOOR USE (60 Round, Seats 4 People) is an outdoor tablecloth that can be used indoors--the fabric looks that good!  Although it's 100% polyester, the fabric feels somewhat similar to the fabric in DIIs traditional 100% cotton tablecloths.  The fabric is spill-proof because it is very tightly woven from polyester thread.  It doesn't feel at all like plastic or oilcloth.

The bold Banana Leaf pattern is printed on, so the reverse side of the tablecloth is white.  The construction is excellent, with a nicely turned and topstitched hem.  The tablecloth is machine washable.",4,"[-42.70653409562003, -14.028950133023084, -8.322813591257036, -3.8791812927653107, 4.209259659838392]",4.209259659838392

92,"Way, way to subtle and dull film.  I totally understand why some critics called it boring.  It was.  Worst was there was no chemistry between Steve Carell and Keira Knightley which is crucial in a film like this that is depressing and goes no where.  You need something for the fans to hang on to.  Poor film, not entertaining.  This is one to pass on.",2,"[-37.89592093725508, -3.5414969351031775, 3.8866729971457747, 2.7125434069656125, -5.898451991291781]",3.8866729971457747
35,"Graham Hancock is known for writing massive bestsellers that advance the theory that an advanced civilization flourished at the end of the last Ice Age, at at time when orthodox historians and archaeologists believe that the human race was restricted to small bands of hunter-gatherers barely clinging to existence.  His first book on this subject was Fingerprints of the Gods, published about twenty years ago, and Magicians of the Gods is a sequel that supplies an explanation for the question the earlier work couldn't answer: ""If there was such an early civilization, what happened to it?"" Hancock now believes and sets forth the theory that about 12,800 years ago the Earth was struck by a comet which disintegrated over the Northern Hemisphere, causing catastrophic flooding and a rapid rise in  sea levels over the entire planet.  The advanced civilization, which Hancock believes may have been located in submerged areas in and around the modern nation of Indonesia, was lost in this catastrophe, but survivors managed to escape and flee to other areas, teaching indigenous peoples the rudiments of agriculture, metallurgy, and other skills that eventually led to new civilizations in Egypt, the Middle East, the Americas, and elsewhere.

Hancock is an engaging and enthusiastic writer and researcher, and he has amassed a substantial amount of information to support his theories.  Of course those theories are controversial and liable to be dismissed by the ""professionals."" I think that would be a mistake, because Hancock has identified some intriguing similarities between cultures which developed at far removes. This isn't to say there couldn't be other, more prosaic, explanations, of course, such as cultural diffusion and other forms of contact.  His comet theory sounds plausible and deserves not to be dismissed out of hand, as do his warnings of a possible encounter with pieces of the same comet within the next few decades.

I enjoyed Magicians of the Gods as I have most of Hancock's earlier works.  He is a tireless traveler and researcher, and his descriptions of his journeys to long forgotten or ignored sites in South America, the Middle East, and Indonesia are vivid and beautifully accompanied by numerous illustrations.  While I am still not convinced that some hidden Hall of Records containing long lost information is about to be discovered under a pyramid somewhere, I do hope that Hancock continues his research and writing for many years to come.",3,"[-31.165214663750007, -10.916388330852872, -6.255265214789052, -1.1444201444149273, -2.176691180272206]",-1.1444201444149273

She finishes and leaves and goes to bar where she meets Beck and the sparks fly. The journey that Beck and Regina experience will bring tears to your eyes, but it is a well written book.

Cam was so broken and so lost that my heart went out to him, but when he first saw Zoey and lost some of his anger, my heart melted.  He was not a bad guy to begin with, but that was just beautiful and so honest.  I liked the way the truth of Zoey came out, no drama or hidden agendas.  Emma is a very responsible mom who put her daughter's needs first.  Then the chemistry and sweetness between Emma and Cam was golden.  I loved their interactions, both not wanting to push the other and both wanting to know more of other too.  Theirs was a really interesting story with a teary happy ending.

33,"Dallas Sykes is an heir to a multi-billion dollar fortune, infamous playboy, and way more than he seems. His notoriously hedonistic lifestyle is perfect camouflage for him to covertly accomplish things that really matter to him. A horrific past drives him to practice the art of distraction publicly while his true agenda plays out in secret.

Jane Martin, an author, shares a complicated past with Dallas that deeply bonds them but keeps them apart. They've struggled for years to maintain a distance but their resistance is crumbling.

Love, healing, understanding and disastrous consequences are the some of the many rewards and costs of Dallas and Jane coming together. Secrets and history carry stumbling blocks. Staying apart hasn't worked out well for either of them. They have to decide if they're strong enough to withstand the bad to find the good.

This book starts out overly dramatic and confusing, but improved when it veered away from international intrigue and into more personal territory, cutting to the chase. The story was at its best when dealing with Dallas, Jane, and their experiences and resulting issues.

There were a lot of times I was frustrated with this book but it came together and I liked it. I'm looking forward to reading the next two books and seeing where it all goes. There are a lot of questions to be answered and, I suspect, some surprises coming.

This trilogy will appeal to readers who enjoy stepbrother type romances.",2,"[-45.11131932765439, -3.2423485219447556, -5.160834751047026, -2.3994788419782482, -1.9203525660744227]",-1.9203525660744227
