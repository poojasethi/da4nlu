11,But still a good story. This book honestly could've been finished at around 70%. I thought it was a pretty good book at that point. All the drama after that seemed to be miscellaneous. Too much extra stuff.,3,"[-52.82185443248868, -1.733300813078742, 7.746429300685364, -3.4447425680553643, -6.194265172174938]",7.746429300685364

95,"After a kerfuffle with ip addresses, Win 7, an AV firewall and the Envy 4520 installation software, I finally got the printer installed and working. This printer produces great copy and is so inexpensive that if it only lasts a year or so, I'm happy. It's very light in weight yet still built well. I bought my wife one of these 4520 printers last year and decided to replace my fancy color Laser printer with another one. Both 4520 units run well wirelessly and print quickly. I'm sure the ink I'll use in this thing won't be that cheap. But, I don't really use it for more than occasional printing so that won't be a problem.",4,"[-44.37305185314635, -17.694356576981622, -10.293509234143638, -1.6263299102764854, 2.9723772632167123]",2.9723772632167123
21,"[REVISION:  someone indicated a new edited copy is available although I have not personally re-read this to see.]

First of all, I know some of you are truly bothered when a book isn't edited and you find typo's and such.  If this is you, be forewarned that there are some throughout (like the use of ""to"" in place of ""too"", misspellings and such).  Putting that aside, I really enjoyed this romance story.  When the main character's mother dies, she finds out that she has a father who never knew of her existence.  Through the development of this relationship she gets to know her future love.  I loved watching their romance unfold, although as you read you know that trouble is brewing.  When trouble does rear it's ugly held I almost felt like crying myself.  I love a romance story that has me cheering for the happily ever after.  I found something very compelling about this story and it ended on just the right note.  If you are wondering if this is a book you can share with your young adult romance reader, I'd say give this one a miss as they do have a physical relationship.  Thankfully, from my perspective this wasn't a main point of the book so I was able to skim though.  These two characters fall in love with more than each other's looks.  I can't wait to read number two in the series.  Hope you get as engrossed in this one as I did.",4,"[-55.33662336671278, -4.770505163379303, 2.4539722034722224, -4.688955485175863, -0.7043400838977869]",2.4539722034722224
