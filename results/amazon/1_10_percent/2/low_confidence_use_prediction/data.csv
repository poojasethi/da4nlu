The sex is not as graphic as some stories, but it is not really need.

89,"Play Harder is the second book in the Hot for Him serial series. I love serials and this is a hot one! It packs in a lot of meaning and hotness for being so short.

Play Harder starts off exactly where Play Hard ended, with fear of being exposed, hot chemistry between them and the unknown about their future. Jordan and Eric would like nothing more than to be able to be together and play the game they love. But, not only being openly gay players would be exposed, they would be a couple on opposing teams during the wake of a cheating scandal. It can ruin them. Jordan has his family depending on him and Eric loves the game too much to just walk away.

Jordan and Eric have to work together to figure out who is blackmailing them. The play clock is ticking down for them to decide on what to do next. Will the threat of exposure cause Jordan and Eric to part ways or bring them closer than ever? And does it have anything to do with the cheating scandal rocking the game?

I love these two! Jordan is alpha and likes to be in control in the bedroom and really anywhere they can steal some filthy moments together. The chemistry between them is amazingly hot but is their relationship only about sex or is there more?

Overall...it's short, sexy, scandalous and I can't wait for more!

Quotes:

You won't die, Jordan assured him.
But you're going to pray for mercy before Im through with you.

I love feeling how hard you are and knowing that every inch of this is for me.

Spicy or super spicy? he asked.
What do you think? Jordan said. Super spicy, burn my motherf- tongue off. Eric laughed and nodded approvingly. That was the right answer.
Glad I passed your spicy test. Same for you?
Of course. I like my drinks hot. Just like my men.",3,"[-45.2488900499014, -6.057691973646929, -1.0420041190350773, -0.3670250595573301, -0.6570786545324384]",-0.3670250595573301
69,"Ever wondered what it would be like to live during the Elizabethan era? The author spins the time travel dial and you are there. Walking among queens and kings, merchants and explorers. Those with money and those with less eat different foods, wear different clothes, but all follow the same religion, the one practiced by the royals.

A non fiction tale told from the view point of a child living in London during the 1600s, the author did her research. While this book is directed towards a young reading audience, I learned a lot, and your child will have fun while learning too.

And I thought it was a wonderful idea for the author to provide a glossary at the end of the book to help with word pronunciation and understanding their meaning, along with a list of renowned people from the era.

 I read and enjoyed another book in this series, The American West, and Im thrilled that the author included fun little facts you wouldnt normally think about in this book also. Highly recommend this one too.

I received a complimentary copy. My review is voluntarily given.",4,"[-45.75870204965695, -3.942251754118141, -3.309662504388142, -0.6798188171809528, -0.3672654854112748]",-0.3672654854112748

68,"We are at the third book in this series, and it is by far the best in the series! Dont get me wrong, the first two books were fabulous, but this one was just that much better. I couldn't put it down until I finished it, much like the first two. Zam is still on a quest to find her packmates and a way to stop the Emperor. However, along this journey, she discovers much more about her past than she knew before, she gains new allies, and, of course, there are unexpected losses. I loved how this book ended, not because it was a happy ending, but a thrilling ending that left me filled with expectations for the next bookyes, a cliffhanger! Again, I cant wait to get my hands on the next book to see what is in store for these fun and exciting characters. Highly recommend!
