6,"John Sandford has always been one of my favorite authors.  He tells a good (sometimes tall) tale with great writing, good humor, and often salty language.  What I'm really trying to say is that he is a realist with no punches pulled.  Most of his characters are black and white although a few bad guys occasionally have some socially redeeming qualities.

It would be wise when picking up this book to find a comfortable and undisturbed spot to start this novel.  Comfortable because you won't be getting up very often (unless you have prostate difficulty like I do) and undisturbed because you will be angry with anyone who tries to take you away from this story.

As usual, the beginning gives you a peaceful and relaxing orientation period as he introduces characters and puts them firmly in place.  Then the story accelerates from 0 - 100 mph rapidly and you need to keep your wits about you as you try to keep up with the action.  Lots of things happen quickly, action followed by more frenetic action, and you'd better be strapped in for the ride or you'll be left behind.  And you don't want to miss any of this!

""Golden Prey"" is a superior work done by an author at the top of his craft offering several intertwining relationships and subtly changing subplots.  This novel represents some of Mr. Sandford's best work.  I'm betting that you'll agree with me.",4,"[-59.53702349142611, -3.9701417112716597, -0.5306062305445853, -1.3800530030799711, -0.36693840976651315]",-0.36693840976651315

I fell in love with them all over, at one point I almost died but then was ok when I kept reading..I didn't want the book to end. Gail is an amazing writer and keeps you hooked through the entire book. I would highly Recommend this book!!!!",4,"[-57.642731930591225, -3.162930006289689, -2.397369959695393, -2.7035725713302177, -0.9816403851965514]",-0.9816403851965514
68,"We are at the third book in this series, and it is by far the best in the series! Dont get me wrong, the first two books were fabulous, but this one was just that much better. I couldn't put it down until I finished it, much like the first two. Zam is still on a quest to find her packmates and a way to stop the Emperor. However, along this journey, she discovers much more about her past than she knew before, she gains new allies, and, of course, there are unexpected losses. I loved how this book ended, not because it was a happy ending, but a thrilling ending that left me filled with expectations for the next bookyes, a cliffhanger! Again, I cant wait to get my hands on the next book to see what is in store for these fun and exciting characters. Highly recommend! I was provided a complimentary copy of the e-book which I reviewed voluntarily.",4,"[-63.74118569554508, -4.894358048412589, -2.7622067543873463, -2.368680851106227, -1.0504180978849662]",-1.0504180978849662
78,"Gretchen Galway knows how to write funny and sexy story. She also knows how to use frustration, anticipation and a little bit of crazy to build the story. The story was fun and heartwarming. The sex is not as graphic as some stories, but it is not really need. I found my self rooting for Nicki and Ansel.",4,"[-60.16469157224675, -5.381253233884125, -4.220391398806658, -1.8255525732767026, -1.1521031987840613]",-1.1521031987840613

56,"This is a good thriller that has some pretty intense moments  the author does a great job of making you feel as if you are right in the middle of the action and scenes.  The author knows a lot about planes and avionics, and does a pretty good job of not only weaving that into his story but being able to break it down into understandable concepts for those of us who are not so inclined.  The conclusion was refreshing  it had an ending but left the possibility there could be more with the characters: I would be fine either way and I wouldnt mind reading more from this author.

I picked this one up for 99 cents during a Kindle promotion vs. its regular price of $6.99 - if you like engaging thrillers, I would recommend this one as I certainly received more than $6.99 worth of entertainment value.",4,"[-56.475529887693156, -1.7436962002273395, -1.5274606658967853, -1.9815215907945458, -2.0324125091002383]",-1.5274606658967853
