11,But still a good story. This book honestly could've been finished at around 70%. I thought it was a pretty good book at that point. All the drama after that seemed to be miscellaneous. Too much extra stuff.,2,"[-52.82185443248868, 2.8521149888903192, 7.746429300685364, -3.2807080742441777, -5.5014243603866415]",7.746429300685364

A mystery who dun it, but not your typical one.  In the first few chapters a child goes missing as he is out on a walk with his dog and his mom, she is still trying to recover from the separation and divorce from his father and this is just where the story begins.

Narrated by both the mother and the lead detective on the case in alternating chapters there are also great tid bits thrown - blog posts, news articles with comments and current dialogue between the detective and his therapist as he reflects on the case.  These extra things added to the story, but if you don't love books with extras still try this one as 80% of the book is in usual novel form.",3,"[-65.19099329353274, -2.781186756530902, -3.139007228771965, -2.1952531900462926, -1.7023083668724084]",-1.7023083668724084

68,"We are at the third book in this series, and it is by far the best in the series! Dont get me wrong, the first two books were fabulous, but this one was just that much better. I couldn't put it down until I finished it, much like the first two. Zam is still on a quest to find her packmates and a way to stop the Emperor. However, along this journey, she discovers much more about her past than she knew before, she gains new allies, and, of course, there are unexpected losses. I loved how this book ended, not because it was a happy ending, but a thrilling ending that left me filled with expectations for the next bookyes, a cliffhanger! Again, I cant wait to get my hands on the next book to see what is in store for these fun and exciting characters. Highly recommend! I was provided a complimentary copy of the e-book which I reviewed voluntarily.",4,"[-63.74118569554508, -10.271340032876374, -5.376830029926344, -1.8718318317583442, -1.7528435685137869]",-1.7528435685137869
