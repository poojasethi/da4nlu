11,But still a good story. This book honestly could've been finished at around 70%. I thought it was a pretty good book at that point. All the drama after that seemed to be miscellaneous. Too much extra stuff.,2,"[-52.82185443248868, -0.2973492071986765, 7.746429300685364, -2.624424157674046, -5.927135385274692]",7.746429300685364

95,"After a kerfuffle with ip addresses, Win 7, an AV firewall and the Envy 4520 installation software, I finally got the printer installed and working. This printer produces great copy and is so inexpensive that if it only lasts a year or so, I'm happy. It's very light in weight yet still built well. I bought my wife one of these 4520 printers last year and decided to replace my fancy color Laser printer with another one. Both 4520 units run well wirelessly and print quickly. I'm sure the ink I'll use in this thing won't be that cheap. But, I don't really use it for more than occasional printing so that won't be a problem.",4,"[-44.37305185314635, -16.648294098464053, -10.293509234143638, -1.0050657783973391, 3.346437106251366]",3.346437106251366
