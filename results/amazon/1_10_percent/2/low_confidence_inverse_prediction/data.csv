A mystery who dun it, but not your typical one.  In the first few chapters a child goes missing as he is out on a walk with his dog and his mom, she is still trying to recover from the separation and divorce from his father and this is just where the story begins.

Narrated by both the mother and the lead detective on the case in alternating chapters there are also great tid bits thrown - blog posts, news articles with comments and current dialogue between the detective and his therapist as he reflects on the case.  These extra things added to the story, but if you don't love books with extras still try this one as 80% of the book is in usual novel form.",3,"[-65.19099329353274, -0.47292764267245246, -1.8044984411878682, -0.5952599389028097, -2.579224116833946]",-0.47292764267245246

31,"I read this book a few years ago and it has stuck with me as one of my favorites. I didn't think I'd like a book about a caveman and a girl that is transported back in time, but Shay Savage did something with this story that had me smiling, laughing, crying and clapping. My emotions were all over the place.
This was not just a great story,  but an amazing adventure. I can't recommend this book enough.",2,"[-49.01014164634473, -8.181758493175218, -0.9554285128178899, -2.624189217928811, -0.6616801022124355]",-0.6616801022124355
24,"I received this book from the author to give an honest review.
I wish I could give Deja Blue and Ruby Blue more than 5 stars because both books deserve it.

Book 2 in a great magical series Deja Blue has the same characters Ruby, Jeremy, Anya and Brennan. You will get to meet new characters and learn that Ruby has new abilities from the bite she received from the dragon that her and her friends accidentally killed. Which is in book 1 Ruby Blue.

In Deja Blue there are mermaids, trolls, a new love angle going on. Everything is fast-paced and will leave you wanting more. Of course Jeremy still has me laughing with drama filled life at times hehe. Especially when he was on his date and he starts texting Ruby asking her how to get red slushie out of white pants.

Of course Ruby has me laughing again with the way she talks. She was written perfectly in this story When she is with Nick and his parents. And he goes to wake her up in the morning.
This one part will make you burst out laughing ""Ohmygoshhh! Your parents! They're right next door! Get the hell outta my bed-couch-thing-whateverthehell it is! They're gonna think I'm a ho-bag!""
It's nice to know that Ruby cares what his parents will think of her.

If you want a fast-paced, action-filled, laughter, love,friendship and  magic then I highly suggest you give this book a try. Where this book left off I want to know more about the hit that was put on Ruby, what more will happen with the Water Court. And what exactly is up with Prince Brennan I feel as though he has feelings for a special someone!",4,"[-54.766038856052774, -4.411480674226056, -6.250719996700737, -0.6816915521297101, -1.0252672150103337]",-0.6816915521297101

I fell in love with them all over, at one point I almost died but then was ok when I kept reading..I didn't want the book to end. Gail is an amazing writer and keeps you hooked through the entire book. I would highly Recommend this book!!!!",4,"[-57.642731930591225, -5.4080070786044665, -3.659571899565801, -0.7292166372778964, -2.6286080140985764]",-0.7292166372778964
52,This was a good book! Maureen and Smith have been dancing around their feelings for years. These two are both too scared to tell the other how they feel for fear of the other person not feeling the same way. It was interesting watching these two work out how to talk to the other one.,4,"[-54.896979544674906, -2.7553688293691705, -0.8968164320687952, -1.5714148518305553, -1.2951463201853817]",-0.8968164320687952
17,It is hard for me to believe that this was a memoir not a fiction novel.  Read way to much like a fiction book where the author is the heroine in the story.  Also she goes against one of my beliefs as Christian (women preachers) so I am unable to recommend this book.,4,"[-36.9428687484666, -2.583245289105939, -0.9088672909973434, -2.661462042793698, -1.4770796697676114]",-0.9088672909973434
49,"I'm not really sure how to classify this book.  It could be useful in a wide variety of situations, but it's such an introduction to the basics, that it probably won't take you very far.  I could see it championed as business management self-help, or maybe as side reading for an intro six-sigma course.

Overall, it reads more like a textbook and the state diagrams reminded me a lot of sentence diagramming done in grade school English classes - useful if you're going to work in the field, but otherwise not essential to understanding the content.

There were less than a handful of places where a concept was presented and I thought ""huh, that's interesting"", which is one of the key measures I use for judging these kind of books.

The 16-page appendix is actually an extremely good summary of the entire book.  You could get the whole idea from just reading that appendix and then referencing the main chapter for any further explanation you need.",4,"[-46.59360549157152, -4.511645325913867, -1.3231599944225891, -2.4176297915282694, -2.263977638923792]",-1.3231599944225891
