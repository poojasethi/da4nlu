69,This album is not only a great album but an important part of the history of Rock N Roll. It contained entirely original material and was a turning point for Led Zeppelin which was beginning to use more complicated layering. It has been certified 11x Platinum and was rated by Rolling Stone Magazine as number 148 in their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. It is essential to any comprehensive rock collection.,4,"[16.457051184441287, -20.016640681842297, -0.7227755229901023, -6.177135059620969, -1.0689393645841792]",16.457051184441287
76,"The bags are fine, but they are really too large for the Hoover vacuum we own even though it is the Hoover recommendation.  They bunch up in the storage space so they fill rather quickly.  Plus, the mounting instructions...putting them on the vacuum...are somewhat confusing at first.  I wish there was a different size or type bag, but these do function and will do.",3,"[11.18863522765512, -19.02247123684309, -10.834453169369995, -2.5789926874580003, 1.0422417430816215]",11.18863522765512
74,"I don't know why these get such high ratings, but I guess it's because they're natural.  However I don't like the way they taste at all.  I got the 5 flavor pack and don't like any of the flavors  In fact, I will probably throw most of them out, because their tastes are actually stomach turning to me.",1,"[8.076340577990479, -19.579495286702613, -7.336232036530422, -3.4259224951691927, -2.0038234702845266]",8.076340577990479
66,"Readers ready to get the holiday season started, pick up Eva Marie Eversons A-Christmas-Carol-inspired novella now and join Charlie Dixon as she learns to embrace the spirit of Christmas.

Not one to appreciate the classics, Charlie dreads working on the schools production of A Christmas Carol. Yet, as she learns the history behind the Charles Dickens story, she begins to recognize ageless truths that offer fresh perspective for her current circumstances. All the events of Charlie experiences occur quickly and without a lot of character development, since they do take place within a novella, but still tell a delightful and inspirational holiday story.

Heartwarming and full of family, forgiveness, and romance, God Bless Us Every One is the great read for cozying under a blanket on a chilly evening. I recommend it to those in need of a little holiday inspiration.

Thanks to LitFuse Publicity Group, I received a copy of God Bless Us Every One and the opportunity to provide an honest review. I was not required to write a positive review, and all the opinions I have expressed are my own.",3,"[-27.1182042885282, -19.487247126946308, -5.602763394129132, -8.679350392867043, 4.509641782899191]",4.509641782899191

63,"John Galsworthy may not retain the luster of other British novelists of 100 years ago, but he remains a treat to read.  As prior reviewer Sean Curley says, this saga about the slowly declining fortunes of a bourgeois British family is written in a Victorian/Edwardian style, but his criticism of the Forsytes -- to me a matter more of gentle irony than raucous satire -- is what makes the series so readable.

This three-volume saga combined into one economical Oxford paperback is a fine way to do it.",3,"[-3.1907008045076313, 3.591844435410339, -7.967983777881311, -6.151126768460198, -2.589694768622267]",3.591844435410339

I am so glad that I did get it because I loved the story as well, I love reading books that are heartwarming. This book was beautifully written that it gave me all the feels and I felt like I was feeling all the emotions that the characters were feeling as well.

77,This is a very elegant looking fruit bowl. It is very solidly built and sturdy. Great to use to hold large fruit on any counter top. I previously used a bowl. The only draw back with this one is that you can not use it for smaller snacks or grapes. The good news is that it looks great and will likely last a lifetime.,4,"[-5.918128385721078, -17.33480556955509, -0.6781923977612703, -9.801176995873995, 2.386950278829088]",2.386950278829088
