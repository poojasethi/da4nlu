38,"This is the sequel to THE CRUSADER, which I highly recommend reading first to understand the love story. Who cares if there are some spelling and grammatical errors! The books stands as a great love story. KINGDOM COME is my favorite of the two books, very emotional with an ending that completes both books. This series is worth the read.",4,"[-50.25076489330558, -16.031614023617664, -2.774978910104907, -1.4659815042525288, -0.2894861212162376]",-0.2894861212162376
35,"Good medical drama/action read with plenty of twists and turns and unexpected surprises! I usually get bogged down with med drama books when the author goes into too much detail about procedures and skills but this one had the proper balance of ""okay this is what/why I'm dong that"" and it didn't detract from the flow of the story.",3,"[-52.72041270837157, -5.059852680820108, -1.6001694313591535, -0.45599717754154756, -3.742125088707533]",-0.45599717754154756
26,"This was my first Amelia Gray story. It was quite intriguing on seeing how the Duke and Louisa would connect. I enjoyed her nickname of Ms. Prim and Proper and enjoyed how the Duke was able to adapt to all her sisters.

My favorite scene was them all fitting in the crucible to go spy on Gwen and Mr. Standley.",3,"[-66.9326275227097, -12.551241915869195, -3.679049284296844, -0.46995053819995747, -0.7424300508367598]",-0.46995053819995747
