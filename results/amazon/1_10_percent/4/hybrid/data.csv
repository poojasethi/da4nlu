63,"John Galsworthy may not retain the luster of other British novelists of 100 years ago, but he remains a treat to read.  As prior reviewer Sean Curley says, this saga about the slowly declining fortunes of a bourgeois British family is written in a Victorian/Edwardian style, but his criticism of the Forsytes -- to me a matter more of gentle irony than raucous satire -- is what makes the series so readable.

This three-volume saga combined into one economical Oxford paperback is a fine way to do it.",1,"[-35.24008296525395, 6.87614086028198, -3.6278808786128898, -2.935878491026438, -1.473832841260868]",6.87614086028198

62,This story was unlike most MC stories I've read. It still had the innocent too good for MC life female with the bad biker dude falling mady in love. What got me hooked was the story line. Steel and Flame are perfect. There is violence and many twists that I don't see coming and I can't help but want more. You will have a cliffhanger at the end.,2,"[-49.67562149068821, -10.232226715128505, 5.786907424388108, -2.640604121069953, -0.36679034772923796]",5.786907424388108
18,"The plot of this book was richly described in the editorial reviews. Therefore my review will be very brief.

This book has a very unique, well written plot - a plot that makes you say WOW at the end. That accounts for the 4 parts suspense. It makes it difficult to put the book down even for a moment.

Written by a noted romance author, the 1 part romance is so explicit it could make you blush. I wouldn't recommend this book to your grandmother, but might recommend it to a friend. Definitely worth reading!",2,"[-57.77572029894716, -10.7581198396473, 5.728391775521558, -3.157020540484282, 0.5495102970514669]",5.728391775521558
66,"Readers ready to get the holiday season started, pick up Eva Marie Eversons A-Christmas-Carol-inspired novella now and join Charlie Dixon as she learns to embrace the spirit of Christmas.

Not one to appreciate the classics, Charlie dreads working on the schools production of A Christmas Carol. Yet, as she learns the history behind the Charles Dickens story, she begins to recognize ageless truths that offer fresh perspective for her current circumstances. All the events of Charlie experiences occur quickly and without a lot of character development, since they do take place within a novella, but still tell a delightful and inspirational holiday story.

Heartwarming and full of family, forgiveness, and romance, God Bless Us Every One is the great read for cozying under a blanket on a chilly evening. I recommend it to those in need of a little holiday inspiration.

Thanks to LitFuse Publicity Group, I received a copy of God Bless Us Every One and the opportunity to provide an honest review. I was not required to write a positive review, and all the opinions I have expressed are my own.",4,"[-56.730584373747064, -16.978887051365483, -1.4118588687380853, -5.234301754663608, 5.5502052659601615]",5.5502052659601615

I got the 5 flavor pack and don't like any of the flavors  In fact, I will probably throw most of them out, because their tastes are actually stomach turning to me.",1,"[-21.74256493509553, -17.657368355472542, -3.738359511671149, -0.45705342387461334, -1.1197037117547686]",-0.45705342387461334
9,"CIA buffs, modern history buffs, political history buffs rejoice.  The Good Spy is a great addition to your reading list.  My last KB read (a collaborative effort) was his esteemed biography of Oppenheimer.  The Good Spy doesn't have quite the heft of that volume, but it has all the substance, and is characterized by the same fluid writing.  Moreover, though it's a (hi)story with which I did have some familiarity going in, it nonetheless taught me quite a lot -- about both Ames and his times -- that I hadn't encountered before.  Terrific book.",4,"[-44.397861211197025, -9.770883691968926, -0.4900621840664683, -1.221350396333304, -1.044344239351375]",-0.4900621840664683
20,"I've taken a fancy to memoirs and essays lately, and Vowell's stands out among them - primarily because most of her essays have a political/patriotic/historical flavor to them.  It's a refreshing change from the typical tales of love, work, and foibles that are in many memoirs.",3,"[-48.41362929535876, -5.562554419038808, -2.9342625144283723, -0.5043571335574826, -1.2238119097642612]",-0.5043571335574826

35,"Good medical drama/action read with plenty of twists and turns and unexpected surprises!
