90,"This is a start to a new series in the Fate Mountain Shifters world.  Rollo is the Police Chief on Fate Mountain and is in charge of the Bear Patrol.  Hes investigating stolen jewels and happens upon the scent of his mate at the scene.  Zoe is Coreys half sister and she has gotten herself involved with the Russian Mafia and needs to steal the jewels to pay back the mobster.  She doesnt expect to get caught by Rollo and she doesnt expect him to be her mate.

I really love this world but I have to be complete honest here.  I thought Zoe was immature and a spoiled brat.  She had been given all the money she could want from her brother but still she blamed him for so many things.  He treated her like the troublemaker she was but she didn't see it that way.

All in all this is a great book and a great new addition to Fate Mountain.",4,"[-61.75497139692459, -5.6115527034870025, -5.185164657631592, 0.2660251387527568, -1.1912450297427752]",0.2660251387527568

1,"Superb work, which I think was even better than 'Wolf Hall', perhaps because I'm now used to Ms Mantel's writing style and also feel I know Thomas Cromwell - a character who's usually in the background of Tudor histories where we focus on Henry VIII and his entourage.
This work covers Henry's disenchantment with Anne, as he falls for Jane Seymour, 'like a flower, head drooping, modest as a drift of green-white hellebore' . Meanwhile it is left to Cromwell to arrange the legal case for Anne's adultery and convenient execution:
'the process clear, logical and designed to create corpses by due process of law.'
The stream of consciousness style of writing puts the reader inside Cromwell's head - recollections from years ago float alongside current events and make him a character you understand. Can't wait for the final volume; although I feel I know him so well I can't bear for him to meet his end...",4,"[-51.421829502064284, -1.1932065888457544, -3.3028886731010694, -0.8462420598175273, 0.22394452204656057]",0.22394452204656057

It's a refreshing change from the typical tales of love, work, and foibles that are in many memoirs.",3,"[-48.41362929535876, -1.0342158921965288, -1.9437725942034239, -1.8349161577144666, -1.1053598699154872]",-1.0342158921965288
