13,"...you're going to adore Rooftops Of Tehran.  It's a fascinating debut novel -- full of originality, humor, and poignancy -- that takes place during the final days of the Shah's rule in Iran.

Here, in Iran's largest city, 17 year old Pasha Shahed and his wisecracking best friend Ahmed fall head over heels in love with two soon-to-be friends:  Zari and Faheemeh.  But one problem stands in the way:  Pasha's loved one, Zari, is already betrothed from birth to a good-hearted and well-liked man who is called Doctor.

This would be a happily-ever-after story were it not for the dreaded SAVAK -- the secret police -- who end up smashing the lovers' dreams.  There are unexpected twists and turns in this story (no spoilers!) -- some improbable...but if the reader can suspend belief for a few hours, the story is a strong testimony to the power of love, friendship, and hope over pain and evil.

The author sets out to shake up the jingoistic American feelings, and he resoundingly succeeds.  The pages devoted to the propping up and support by the CIA of the Shah are downright unsettling, but need to be read and understood.  Instead of discovering caricatures, we see these Iranian characters close up:  with a grim, fatalistic view on life based on years of tyranny, offset by resiliency, generosity, hospitality, and a ""we'll survive anything"" attitude.  It's not our media portrayal, but then again, we Americans are not the same as the cartoon-figures that are portrayed in Iran.

The underlying theme is that we are all united in our humanness.  We all have our dreams, our hopes, our loves...and often, our difficult choices.  Bravo to Mr. Seraji!  This is a book I won't soon forget.",3,"[-51.51566527432031, -3.8657801000667966, -2.592342447178937, -2.192720243660797, 0.14995548594734487]",0.14995548594734487
20,"I've taken a fancy to memoirs and essays lately, and Vowell's stands out among them - primarily because most of her essays have a political/patriotic/historical flavor to them.

9,"CIA buffs, modern history buffs, political history buffs rejoice.  The Good Spy is a great addition to your reading list.  My last KB read (a collaborative effort) was his esteemed biography of Oppenheimer.  The Good Spy doesn't have quite the heft of that volume, but it has all the substance, and is characterized by the same fluid writing.  Moreover, though it's a (hi)story with which I did have some familiarity going in, it nonetheless taught me quite a lot -- about both Ames and his times -- that I hadn't encountered before.  Terrific book.",3,"[-44.397861211197025, -7.310797227325119, -5.36538069629778, -1.1704444991117617, -0.15324540201285863]",-0.15324540201285863
47,"I have read all of Kaye Blue's books and love them all. With this one, I felt that the chemistry between the hero and heroine just wasn't 100% there. Ms. Blue is one of those authors that is very descriptive in her writing but I didn't find that to be the case here. I had no investment as to why I should care that it took 10 years for them to come together. I will continue to read her books in the hopes the next book in this series gets back the style of writing that she is known for.",4,"[-57.47045354952938, -0.7217534083192856, -4.076577118137778, -0.19712515370586647, -0.4856910807067396]",-0.19712515370586647

Those are the unique romance novels and its nice to read something a lil different when you read hundreds of romance novels a year like I do.
 It was a good story and worth the read.",3,"[-51.42677812715289, -4.606191279489579, -1.7331953986415822, -0.9503850473124003, -0.6072117506861086]",-0.6072117506861086
