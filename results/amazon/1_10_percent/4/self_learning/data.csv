66,"Readers ready to get the holiday season started, pick up Eva Marie Eversons A-Christmas-Carol-inspired novella now and join Charlie Dixon as she learns to embrace the spirit of Christmas.

Not one to appreciate the classics, Charlie dreads working on the schools production of A Christmas Carol. Yet, as she learns the history behind the Charles Dickens story, she begins to recognize ageless truths that offer fresh perspective for her current circumstances. All the events of Charlie experiences occur quickly and without a lot of character development, since they do take place within a novella, but still tell a delightful and inspirational holiday story.

Heartwarming and full of family, forgiveness, and romance, God Bless Us Every One is the great read for cozying under a blanket on a chilly evening. I recommend it to those in need of a little holiday inspiration.

63,"John Galsworthy may not retain the luster of other British novelists of 100 years ago, but he remains a treat to read.  As prior reviewer Sean Curley says, this saga about the slowly declining fortunes of a bourgeois British family is written in a Victorian/Edwardian style, but his criticism of the Forsytes -- to me a matter more of gentle irony than raucous satire -- is what makes the series so readable.

This three-volume saga combined into one economical Oxford paperback is a fine way to do it.",1,"[-35.24008296525395, 3.544186302635513, -7.632130351617597, -4.410421537726424, -2.360525865678131]",3.544186302635513

77,This is a very elegant looking fruit bowl. It is very solidly built and sturdy. Great to use to hold large fruit on any counter top. I previously used a bowl. The only draw back with this one is that you can not use it for smaller snacks or grapes. The good news is that it looks great and will likely last a lifetime.,4,"[-34.9832294057414, -17.48197836118391, -0.4931641492183543, -7.909844854140021, 2.6212669667602464]",2.6212669667602464
