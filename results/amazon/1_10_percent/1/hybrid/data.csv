7,"Some foul language.  Have to think reading the book because he and his partner are investigating two cases at the same time.  His partner has a personal interest in the secondary case, from years ago, they are working.  Could the two cases be connected?",1,"[-51.67482863082377, 6.517249702540273, -4.348805895651749, -3.5510663009920878, -2.756704167028992]",6.517249702540273

48,"I got most of the way through this book and then just had to put it down- it was like honey on a hot day- sticky goodness at first but just a puddle going in a hundred directions before you know it. While the book appealed to me because the writer has a unique, almost repetitive style (something like an autistic or hyperactive person may have- and I base that opinion on books written about people with these diagnoses, not to sound rude or anything) but after about the mid-point of the book, the plot seemed to fall apart- the reader doesn't have enough information to remain connected to the characters or what is happening in the story, and while that itself may be part of the story (like a wicked twist ending in the works) it just felt too jumbled and disoragnized to me, so I stopped reading it because I stopped enjoying it.",2,"[-50.12622532861279, -2.335731298909053, 4.314342200579329, -5.297011178002111, -2.076746956449854]",4.314342200579329

20,The story was a little slow to start but as I read more you really get involved with the character. A sad lonely man who gave up too much for friendship when he had the love of two women.  But he gave it all to the monster Owen.  What bad choice he made.,3,"[-54.80552691361179, -6.082743077453023, -3.7448436295774616, 3.843326524666809, -4.8247796625514745]",3.843326524666809
74,"Must confess.  I had to go back and reread this book.  I bought book 2 and for the life of me, couldn't remember the details of book 1.  This one.  After looking at it, I had bought this in September of 2013.  No wonder I couldn't remember.  There's been a lot of books between now and then.  This book is written so so well.  Yes there's drama.  Maybe too much because, let's face it, can a relationship have this much crap occur?  But I loved it!  It's lengthy so be prepared to hang in there.  It's good.  Promise.  There's just the right attention to detail.  Very little grammatical errors.  Not enough to distract me anyway.  The story is told from dual POV.  I like those, where u get both sides.  I will say the sex scenes are limited on detail.  It's there but the feelings between the characters are what pull you in.  Reading their struggles and reconciling their feelings of each other.  I highly recommend this book.  As well as book 2.  I believe they are both .99 each and I promise you, they are both worth that.",4,"[-48.3016166097933, -2.5481755979480827, -6.420262415894918, -3.8924723591098376, -1.215710048611983]",-1.215710048611983
87,This was an interesting story concept. It caused more questions than answered. But I liked it. Why can't Durecilla read? What's the deal with Stevie. Why are they hiding? So many adventures to read to find my answers.,4,"[-39.1051028804731, -4.131447833442561, -2.502810832966086, -1.4019737479179146, -4.362948025894373]",-1.4019737479179146
80,"I wanted a distressed leather belt to match a pair of dress shoes I like to wear with my slacks for the office.  This belt did not work for me in that department.  It is WAY darker than the photo made it out to be, and the 40mm width is way too wide for slacks... that's a little more than 1.5""... most belts for slacks are around 30mm wide ...  I should have done my homework and figured that out before I ordered it.

That being said... it does go really well with jeans and an old pair of boots I won... so I kept it for that purpose.

On the PLUS side... the belt appears to be very well made, and I expect to get a good 10-12 years out of it.  It's a very thick leather, and the stitching looks great (it's not a cheapo, glued belt... it is stitched).  If you need a nice heavy belt to go with jeans or some heavy-duty khakis, this will work.",3,"[-27.717970963822058, -11.471801790901399, -2.633100241069882, -2.134341930417591, -1.534245813727173]",-1.534245813727173
39,"This novella lacks the time to develop a dramatic peak. Whether it would be machinery breakdown or clashing personalities, it must be quick- and Vasicek stretches the tale of two humans' loneliness too far. Otherwise, the story of an itinerant trader could be classic Heinlein or Norton- updated with Virtual Reality through a jack connected to the brain.",1,"[-39.86360255064692, -5.653361487545723, -1.552651911191412, -2.3524488751445505, -2.852329145176958]",-1.552651911191412
