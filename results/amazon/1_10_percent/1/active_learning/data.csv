22,"I enjoyed this book,  I think it's the second of the author's ""Rogues"" series,  which was well written and well edited with an interesting plot that had some unexpected twists. The main characters, Christian-Lord Shrewsbury, and Helene-Miss Whitcombe, are complex and interesting people, even if they start off a bit stiff. The author goes for a bit of a Pride and Prejudice type of romance-two people who are not socially equivalent and not similar personally, but who just can't shake their attraction for each other. They even make references to Miss Austen's works and compare his proposal to that of Mr. Darcy. : )

There is a good amount of philosophical debate on the rights of women and education for women and the ""lower classes"" , which was an important issue of the time.  The villain is suitably slippery and his methods devious. Helene's sisters, school sponsors and fellow teachers make up a good supporting cast of characters from which the author can draw other stories in this series.

This is a clean read, kissing only, but there is some mild violence.

Heat factor mild.",3,"[-58.00032004953055, -0.9507417026476155, -4.558007796506573, -1.8193527866327956, -1.1858030690813255]",-0.9507417026476155
31,"Like fellow historical romance novels of the year, I feel divided in this review of the story. The actual story itself is likable, charming and sweet, with a unique plot that was rewarding to read. Yet I think the book in its entirely was not a strong introduction to a new series and, for a new reader such as myself, to the author.

The romance lacked emotional and physical attraction. It is little hints of aspiring affinity that I think are necessary in a romance novel, especially one set in the historical era. When the chemistry was present between Cat and Marcus it was wonderful and believable. I wish the author would have only done more with the romance.

However the plot was enriching. I really enjoyed the concept of having a landlord for a hero. It's rare to find a hero that is not among the standards of other romances. So this simple fact made the plot and the race towards a happily-ever-after ending likable and entertaining.

As for the writing, apart from the romance I enjoyed it. This book was a sweet read that contained the right amount of humor exchanged between the characters throughout the book. I thought it was a delightful read that should it not have been labeled as a romance novel, I think I would have liked it much more.

18,"Frankly, I'm embarrassed to associate with this book, and I expect better out of an author who claims to be a ""USA Today bestselling author.""  If this were the author's first or second book, or first major release, sure this'd be great.  But...

""The Challenge"" is fluff, silly premise with a futuristic setting and a world setting entirely ridiculous.  The back cover of the book is spot on for setting and plot.  Woman with no psychic powers teleported to the future to take a one person challenge from alien powers, where winning will save the Earth.  A man from another planet must awaken her psychic powers using erotic teasing -- his own world is also at risk.  Throw in spanking, bondage, see-through clothing (hers), an over-the-top control freak hero, and a few inconsistent premises (virginity a must until it becomes inconvenient).  The leading man is so obnoxious, that I don't understand why she doesn't murder him in his sleep.

There is one bright spark, which is that the main female lead doesn't ever get caught up in anger over past events or things that (constantly) don't go her way.  She quickly accepts the situation, takes enjoyment where she can, doesn't fight against the odds to get her own way, and doesn't ever hold a grudge.  I wish I could be more like that.",1,"[-49.4753998053108, -1.1288461333888353, -4.732131376120131, -1.0940204698600076, -3.8101022047117192]",-1.0940204698600076

74,"Must confess.  I had to go back and reread this book.  I bought book 2 and for the life of me, couldn't remember the details of book 1.  This one.  After looking at it, I had bought this in September of 2013.  No wonder I couldn't remember.  There's been a lot of books between now and then.  This book is written so so well.  Yes there's drama.  Maybe too much because, let's face it, can a relationship have this much crap occur?  But I loved it!  It's lengthy so be prepared to hang in there.  It's good.  Promise.  There's just the right attention to detail.  Very little grammatical errors.  Not enough to distract me anyway.  The story is told from dual POV.  I like those, where u get both sides.  I will say the sex scenes are limited on detail.  It's there but the feelings between the characters are what pull you in.  Reading their struggles and reconciling their feelings of each other.  I highly recommend this book.  As well as book 2.  I believe they are both .99 each and I promise you, they are both worth that.",4,"[-48.3016166097933, -2.5481755979480827, -6.420262415894918, -3.8924723591098376, -1.215710048611983]",-1.215710048611983

80,"I wanted a distressed leather belt to match a pair of dress shoes I like to wear with my slacks for the office.  This belt did not work for me in that department.  It is WAY darker than the photo made it out to be, and the 40mm width is way too wide for slacks... that's a little more than 1.5""... most belts for slacks are around 30mm wide ...  I should have done my homework and figured that out before I ordered it.

That being said... it does go really well with jeans and an old pair of boots I won... so I kept it for that purpose.

On the PLUS side... the belt appears to be very well made, and I expect to get a good 10-12 years out of it.  It's a very thick leather, and the stitching looks great (it's not a cheapo, glued belt... it is stitched).  If you need a nice heavy belt to go with jeans or some heavy-duty khakis, this will work.",3,"[-27.717970963822058, -11.471801790901399, -2.633100241069882, -2.134341930417591, -1.534245813727173]",-1.534245813727173
39,"This novella lacks the time to develop a dramatic peak. Whether it would be machinery breakdown or clashing personalities, it must be quick- and Vasicek stretches the tale of two humans' loneliness too far.
