48,"I got most of the way through this book and then just had to put it down- it was like honey on a hot day- sticky goodness at first but just a puddle going in a hundred directions before you know it. While the book appealed to me because the writer has a unique, almost repetitive style (something like an autistic or hyperactive person may have- and I base that opinion on books written about people with these diagnoses, not to sound rude or anything) but after about the mid-point of the book, the plot seemed to fall apart- the reader doesn't have enough information to remain connected to the characters or what is happening in the story, and while that itself may be part of the story (like a wicked twist ending in the works) it just felt too jumbled and disoragnized to me, so I stopped reading it because I stopped enjoying it.",2,"[-50.12622532861279, -2.335731298909053, 4.314342200579329, -5.297011178002111, -2.076746956449854]",4.314342200579329

3,"A sexy, knock-your-sock-off kinda read.  I couldn't put it down!  I love this series and was so excited to read Jase and Tesss story.  What a great novel.

Teresa Hamilton has been handed a big ole bag of lemons and shes doing her best to make lemonade, but whats a girl to do when shes in love with her older brothers best friend?  Especially when hes kissed her once, the kind of life altering, never forget it kiss, and then refused to return her calls or texts for over a year?  But luck is with her when she sees him in her music class and they begin to rekindle the close friendship they once shared, before the kiss.  As Teresa and Jase spend time together, they realize that its much more than friendship that lies between them, but as always, life is in the way.  Jase has secrets, big ones; that hes not willing to share.  And Teresa is still trying to deal with the injury that has put the brakes on her dancing career, maybe permanently.  As Teresa and Jase try to build a relationship on shifting sand, life continues to work to keep them apart.  Can they learn to let go and love again and trust in each other or will their pasts define their future?

Looking for a sexy, hot read with great characters, a fast paced storyline and chemistry that almost melts the page?  Then look no further than Be With Me.  I loved this story from start to finish.  The way J. Lynn writes characters with real life pasts and doesnt shy away from hard-hitting topics like suicide, death, and abuse just makes her books that much better.  I enjoyed reading Jase and Tesss story and absolutely fell in love with the hard, yet vulnerable Jase.  The way he doted on Tess, giving her rides after class so she didn't have to walk on her leg just made his seem like a real knight in shining armor without it seeming over the top.  Its exactly the kind of thing all girls want in their relationship.  Dont miss this book!!  And if you haven't read J. Lynns other novel in this series, Wait For Me, then treat yourself and read them both!

16,"This is a great book for new dads!  The book's focus is on day one when the baby is born, so fathers looking for books about what to do when the baby is still inside their mother may want to look elsewhere for reading material.

The book shows dads how to change, clean, feed, soothe and care for their new baby in all kinds of ways.  It gives good practical advice and also cracks a joke once in a while in order to keep the mood light.  There are also illustrations that help give you ideas of how things should look when you are doing things like changing, bathing or swaddling your baby, and those are very helpful!

All in all it's a great book for dads with new babies.  I highly recommend this one!",4,"[-56.52539015956381, -16.357963446124508, -6.991457909464037, -4.873529096698389, 3.0787875814095886]",3.0787875814095886
