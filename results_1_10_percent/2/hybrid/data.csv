16,"as with any non profit, or not for profit, most ultimately become employment agencies for the select few. some executive directors are fair and honest. some take way too much compensation and benefits. any non profit needs to abide by hawaii state pay schedules for people doing the same level of work. gonna throw this in there-churches should pay full taxes on all income just like everyone else, and take their deductions for charitable work just like everyone else.",0,-25.976442761790796,25.976442761790796
20,"I concur with Annie C's take -- they are about power.  Sadly, many priests are into power, as well.  I'm not sure how much God really enters into the picture.  
In some ways, I think of them the same way that I think of the ex-Soviet leaders who morphed into capitalists when that became convenient and profitable.  If it  weren't all about power, then clergy (up and down the ranks) would not be in all of the decision-making positions.  They would actually be serving people.",0,-25.715751432091988,25.715751432091988
8,"""We may be testing that out when millions of pot puffers get behind the wheels of their cars.""

Rich, pot is already easily available to anyone who wants it; virtually nobody who wants to try pot is stymied by prohibition. So I'm not sure why you think ""millions of [new] pot puffers"" will suddenly appear on the roads. Can you explain?

""One possible result: many, many more abusers, because shooting up, toking up, sniffing up will be even more socially acceptable--oh, hey, and safer!--than it is today.""

That's one _possible_ result, but consider this: the most effective way to reduce smoking rates turned out to be regulations that make it socially difficult to smoke. The use of currently-illegal drugs is _already_ highly proscribed among the general public due to decades of demonization of drug users, so it's difficult to imagine legalization suddenly changing this. 

Also, would you start taking heroin if it was legalized tomorrow? No? Nor would most, I suspect.",0,-1.2471421648649557,1.2471421648649557
12,"""...the white supremacists that he has ever so reluctantly criticized are the most faithful part of his base.""

You're just off base John. White supremacists make up a tiny fringe of the population. To try to equate these vile extremists with the millions of good conservatives who elected Donald Trump is the most egregious form of libel.",0,-0.43802667793187666,0.43802667793187666
