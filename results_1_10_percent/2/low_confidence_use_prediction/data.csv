37,"I'm sorry but the argument ""someone disagrees with X, because they need to take a class in X"" is a really weak and somewhat pretentious argument. It would be like if left-wing Catholics objected to the Magisterium, and someone replies ""you just haven't read Aquinas so you simply don't get it."" The fact is its not that Francis doesn't understand Gender theory, its just that he disagrees with it. Now, if you want to argue against him go right ahead, but don't outright assume your disagreement with him is due to his ignorance. Furthermore, it's not helpful to argue according to the clock. It matters not if an idea emerged in ancient, medieval times, or last week, if it is true then it is true. Lets discuss the truth or falsity of Francis' statements then, not what time period they derive from.",0,-1.0492173534227192,1.0492173534227192

8,"""We may be testing that out when millions of pot puffers get behind the wheels of their cars.""

Rich, pot is already easily available to anyone who wants it; virtually nobody who wants to try pot is stymied by prohibition. So I'm not sure why you think ""millions of [new] pot puffers"" will suddenly appear on the roads. Can you explain?

""One possible result: many, many more abusers, because shooting up, toking up, sniffing up will be even more socially acceptable--oh, hey, and safer!--than it is today.""

That's one _possible_ result, but consider this: the most effective way to reduce smoking rates turned out to be regulations that make it socially difficult to smoke. The use of currently-illegal drugs is _already_ highly proscribed among the general public due to decades of demonization of drug users, so it's difficult to imagine legalization suddenly changing this. 

Also, would you start taking heroin if it was legalized tomorrow? No? Nor would most, I suspect.",1,0.5455698645384519,0.5455698645384519
