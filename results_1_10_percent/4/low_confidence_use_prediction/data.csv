2,"When reading through the comments, I find myself scanning the same remarks time after time, on each and every budget/spending/taxation/PFD article ... no 'unfair' sales tax, don't take the PFD, tax all of those plane loads of slope workers from everywhere, but here, and tax only earners ... blah, blah, blah. We do have a big spending problem, and it is completely fair for every single resident of Alaska to contribute to our basic services WHEN THE TIME COMES. The size and expense of our government has grown far beyond what population and inflation markers would qualify as reasonable. It is irresponsible for Governor Walker and our legislature to bypass cost cutting, and immediately jump to increasing revenue. When our budget/size is consistent with the no fluff services that our residents actually need, then take the PFD or a portion thereof, and if needed, a sales tax for all. The PFD has been a lovely gift each year, it is not an entitlement that we should depend on. No cuts, no $$$.",1,2.187187654634804,2.187187654634804

19,"Regarding: ""Protecting minors is ""charged with many expectations and with a history of failures and shortcomings,"" said the Jesuit""
- Integral to protecting children and young people is the importance of always recalling the failures and shortcomings that have brought not just the catholic church, but all men and women of good will to these times. Those failures and errors range from not believing the child to the scandal of episcopal secrecy which is subsequent to the rape of children and molestation of young people by clerics.
- The task of remembering falls largely to the men and women of good will, especially those who minister in the parishes, or who lead households of faith, the domestic churches.",1,1.2994330842136819,1.2994330842136819
