The volume increasing when the conclusions contradict preconceived prejudices.",1,-5.238844627502402,5.238844627502402

2,"How dare you blame the Democratsfor the hatred and bigotry that we have seen since the Chump was elected. All throughout his campaign he spewed messages that were divisive and mean.  He drove his base into a frenzy like sharks going after a whale carcass. The perpetrators of these acts are the true terrorists in our country. They are dangerous, sick and vile. The Chump has led them to believe that it is open season on Jews, Muslims, Latinos and who ever they feel do not belong in America. The Chump has unleashed an army of demons that he will not be able to rein back in.",0,-0.9520673403067761,0.9520673403067761

He should just admit his mistake, condemn the Nazi white supremacist idiots, and get on with business. He should also apologize for his comments.  Instead he continues to defend himself like an 11-year old boy.  What an embarrassment.",1,-0.49676482846764713,0.49676482846764713
