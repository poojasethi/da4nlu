6,"According to this report, DB plan requires this teacher chip in 16% of net pay. ($710 out of $4525.) The dollar amount will increase with salary increases, if any. If all the pension-envy people did that for 30 years, they'd be in decent shape.",0,-26.657701825267623,26.657701825267623
2,"How dare you blame the Democratsfor the hatred and bigotry that we have seen since the Chump was elected. All throughout his campaign he spewed messages that were divisive and mean.  He drove his base into a frenzy like sharks going after a whale carcass. The perpetrators of these acts are the true terrorists in our country. They are dangerous, sick and vile. The Chump has led them to believe that it is open season on Jews, Muslims, Latinos and who ever they feel do not belong in America. The Chump has unleashed an army of demons that he will not be able to rein back in.",0,-1.2318347936128369,1.2318347936128369
